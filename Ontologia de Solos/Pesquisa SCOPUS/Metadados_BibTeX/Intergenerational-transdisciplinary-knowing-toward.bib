	abstract = {The knowledge of historically marginalized learners, including racially and linguistically minoritized learners, tends to be obscured in institutionalized learning contexts and by the dominant discourse of “learning loss,” which was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on critical ethnography and the methodology of shared walks, this article highlights intergenerational ways of knowing embodied and emplaced in the context of traditional farming sustained and mobilized by a Syrian refugee family. We illustrate what children were indeed learning in the land of refuge during the pandemic, with their family, beyond narrowly defined in-school learning. We conceptualize the recentering of intergenerational ways of knowing, often overlooked in colonial institutionalized learning spaces, as transdisciplinary acts for disrupting the hegemonic disciplinary formation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},
