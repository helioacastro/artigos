	abstract = {Food is an entanglement of materiality and social practices, power relations, communities, histories and visions. The feminist approaches people use are string figure, situated knowledge, fictocriticism and storytelling, and bodily practice, such as makingthinking. The experimental is about how people bring together art, research, activism, collective learning, sciences and society into a collective experiment. The paradigmatic changes that urban agroecology necessitates in terms of science-society relations, humans and human settlements positioning within food systems are too important, too entangled, too political to be left to the reified depoliticised practices of (neoliberal) scientific practice. In each case, situated knowledge is viewed as entangled ‘action possibilities’ stemming from embodied practices. Situated knowledge is a broad umbrella under which other forms of knowledge are also present and particular to each case. Film-making is an art, and alternative media is a form of activism.},
