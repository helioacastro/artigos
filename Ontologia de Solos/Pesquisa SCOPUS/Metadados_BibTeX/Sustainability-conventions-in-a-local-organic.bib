	abstract = {In two lines of inquiry, this chapter aims at analysing how Consumer Food Initiatives, here exemplified by the Vestfold Kooperativ, may contribute to food system sustainability. First, the chapter analyses the importance of shared conventions related to environmental, economic, and social sustainability as a common basis for the outcomes of the activities within the CFI. The second line of inquiry is related to process, by investigating the functioning and development of Vestfold Kooperativ. The chapter draws on conventions theory to analyse how shared conventions (hope) and contested issues (trouble) are perceived within the cooperative and how troubles eventually might be overcome. The chapter concludes that, in spite of the troubles that Vestfold Kooperativ faced, there are important lessons to be learnt from their experiences. These are related to the holistic approach to sustainability that was shared within the cooperative and, when promoted externally, may contribute to broadening the debate about possible and sustainable transition pathways in the food system. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Oona Morrow, Esther Veen, and Stefan Wahlen; individual chapters, the contributors.},
