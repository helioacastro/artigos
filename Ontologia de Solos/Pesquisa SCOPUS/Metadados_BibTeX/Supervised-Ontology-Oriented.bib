	abstract = {Soil health plays a vital role in agriculture. A nutrient-rich soil helps in better crop growth and high yield. The agriculture data in India is haphazard and no major effort is seen in maintaining them. Soil chemical property is a basic knowledge to decide on cultivation. Knowledge base to help farmers analyse the soil health by using the chemical properties as the main feature in predicting the health and quality of the soil before the cultivation is a key factor for a better production result. This study drives the idea of building a domain ontology model for soil and also utilizes a neural network in predicting the soil by classifying it as healthy or unhealthy based on six chemical parameters that explain the property of soil. Ontology plays as a knowledge base in storing the properties of the soil which also helps in enabling artificial intelligence concepts on the knowledge to make better decisions. MATLAB deep learning toolbox is used to implement the classification and also TensorFlow's Keras was used to handle the data pre-processing, normalization and also the network architecture to validate the result from the toolbox. MATLAB employs the Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm and performs with 92% accuracy in achieving the classification of soil. © 2022 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.},
