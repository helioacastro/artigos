	abstract = {This report presents the breadth of themes in current research where rural geography and care intersects. Relationships and dimensions of interdependence and distribution of power are addressed. Noting an increasing interest for caring relations in society and the agency of multiple actors, for public contexts such as landscape management and workplaces, I suggest that rural geographers pay attention to the opportunity to “spatialize” care theory development and inform rural policy formulation. Rural geography holds the potential to highlight spatial factors that invite to caring or uncaring and thereby influence rural living conditions in a broad sense. © The Author(s) 2025.
