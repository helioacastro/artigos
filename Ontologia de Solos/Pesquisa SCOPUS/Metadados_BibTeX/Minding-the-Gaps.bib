	abstract = {Increasingly, researchers share climate information as narratives to support decision-making and public action. In these contexts, however, scientists remain the focal storytellers. This article offers our methodology for researchers and communities to share narratives with each other and then to engage in collaborative storytelling. At the center of this work is how the humanities embrace the importance of narratives having gaps—narrative lacunae into which individuals can insert their experiences, needs, and values. Our storytelling- and gaps-based methodology allows communities and researchers to enter and transform each other’s stories. We offer a simulation model that fosters collaborative storytelling and give examples from the storytelling and social-environmental action projects that have emerged over three years of partnership with communities and university students. © 2023 Linda Shenk, Kristie J.
