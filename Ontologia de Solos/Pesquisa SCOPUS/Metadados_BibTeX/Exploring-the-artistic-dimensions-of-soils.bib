	abstract = {The rise of industrialized agriculture, coupled with a global demographic shift toward urbanization, has marginalized every-day connections between individuals and soils. This societal shift has led to a decline in the appreciation of and cultural identity with soils. Amid a broader movement aimed at fostering soil awareness and environmental action, many artists and designers have been instrumental in bringing soils to the cultural mainstream, figuring their esthetic, social, political, and ecological dimensions. Contemporary artists place great importance on the underlying idea of animating soils through artistic practice, often transcending the physical artifact itself to assign agency to soils and the myriad beings that occupy them. Artists harness a multitude of media to articulate human-soil relationships. From the early environmental art movements of the 1960s and 1970s to contemporary works centered on urban and industrial brownfields, soils’ multifaceted roles in CO2 transformation, water and nutrient cycling, agriculture, and as living bodies buffering against pollution have become ground for public discourse. What could this mean for the vadose zone in terms of reflecting on material flows in porous media beyond understandings of soil physics? In this paper, we draw on over 20 years of experience in studying the portrayal of soil in various arts genres to deliberate the potential of creative thinking about and thinking with the vadose zone. © 2024 The Authors.
