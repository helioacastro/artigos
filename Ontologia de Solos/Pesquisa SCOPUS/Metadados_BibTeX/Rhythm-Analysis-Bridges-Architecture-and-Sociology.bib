	abstract = {By bringing the social dynamics in cities to the surface, rhythm analysis offers novel insights into the spatio-temporal notions that characterise urban life and experiences. The research presented in this contribution proposes a rhythm analysis framework for bridging architecture and social sciences to facilitate design interventions that are fine-tuned to the social context in cities. The results identify three aspects of city rhythms: (1) rhythms in the outdoor spaces and around the buildings, conceptualised as “rhythm zones”, (2) rhythms in the care services offered by societal organisations that are hosted in public and semi-public buildings, conceptualised as “rhythm-scapes” and (3) rhythms of ordinary activities that shape the urban social life and interactions, conceptualised as “rhythm spheres”. Each aspect includes different methods for analysing and documenting rhythms, enabling novel possibilities for spatial practices. Focusing on the dynamic quality of physical urban spaces, relations between actors and institutions and interactions between communities creates a bridge between academic research and spatial practice at a level of analysis of the urban social life that is straightforward, replicable and inventive. © (2023), (Lifelong Learning EU).
