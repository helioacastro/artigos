	abstract = {We live in a period of multiple crises, including economic, environmental, and social emergencies. The prioritisation of capitalist economic growth by most political institutions is among the most critical drivers of these crises in a never-ending loop. Against this context, commoning, perceived as collective care, presents an alternative political strategy to respond to those crises. In this paper, we investigate how an anti-mining community in Skouries, Greece, opposes the imposition of a large-scale mining project by forming a commons. Our commons is a women’s collective that sought a sustainable economic alternative to large-scale mining and a model that could influence different political values much needed for politics in a crisis-ridden framework. We argue that commoning can enrich the politics of our times. Commoning highlights the importance of caring collectively for developing collective identities and relations between humans and the environment, which can benefit local, national, and international politics. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
