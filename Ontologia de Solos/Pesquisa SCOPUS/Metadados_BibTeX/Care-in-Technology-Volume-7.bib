	abstract = {Today, it is widely recognized that in order to meet environmental challenges, it will not simply be enough to make our lifestyles greener; also critical is putting an end to the modern conception of the human as master and possessor of nature. However, to bear fruit, this change in anthropology must also be accompanied by a revision in our conception of technology. Since the Enlightenment and the development of industrialization, technology no longer seems to be subject to the guiding principles set by the Greeks: prudence and the search for the right measure in all, which leads to the care of beings and the world. Care in Technology analyzes the historical changes that have led technology to become an unthinkable part of care, and care an unthinkable part of technology. It also establishes the conditions for care to once again become a regulatory principle of the activity of engineers who design technology. © ISTE Ltd 2021.},
