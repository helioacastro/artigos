	abstract = {With an emphasis on Science and Technology Studies (STS), this essay inquires AI standardization (AIS). Through a social cartography and its underlying conceptual tools, it concludes that AI standards are socio-technical hybrids across several domains, made out of associations of heterogeneous entities, which address multiple artificial intelligences. AI standards bear high stakes because they are more than just technical matters: they are political, they take a lot of socio-technical and infrastructural work, and they contribute to how AI is practiced. In AIS webs of relations, AI and related issues are ontologically multiple, which rises important questions about the politics and ethics of AI. © The author(s) 2018.
