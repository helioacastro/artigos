	abstract = {In this chapter, the authors have chosen to structure our discussion around three key analytical avenues, without aiming for exhaustiveness. Each avenue highlights a foundational approach and demonstrates how it is applied to specific objects and case studies. The first avenue, likely the earliest lens through which STS approached environmental issues, stems from the centrality of materiality, particularly as influenced by feminist studies and the various propositions that emerged from them. The second avenue introduces another significant STS approach, which is the denaturalization of the global environment. The third avenue stems from the body of work devoted to environmental justice, and it shifts the focus downward, toward collective mobilizations in response to the social, racial and epistemic inequalities that shape our societies. The chapter briefly highlights the questions raised by environmental STS within the broader context of debates on the Anthropocene. © ISTE Ltd 2025.},
