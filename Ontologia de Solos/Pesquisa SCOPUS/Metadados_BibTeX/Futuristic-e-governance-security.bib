	abstract = {In today's rapidly advancing digital world, governments are increasingly relying on technology to enhance security systems and streamline governance. However, this growing reliance on digital platforms and data collection also presents significant challenges. Cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns pose large risks to sensitive information and can potentially leading to inaccuracies or breaches within deep learning models. There is a pressing need for comprehensive solutions that address these security issues and protect valuable data in the realm of e-governance. Futuristic e-Governance Security With Deep Learning Applications is a timely and indispensable resource that offers a holistic approach to tackling the security challenges of the digital era. The book presents a global perspective on the integration of intelligent systems with cybersecurity applications, highlighting cutting-edge techniques and methodologies to safeguard deep learning models from security attacks and privacy vulnerabilities. By exploring the latest advances and countermeasures in deep learning, this book equips scholars, researchers, and industry experts with the knowledge and tools they need to address security concerns and develop robust e-governance systems. This comprehensive volume not only sheds light on the current state-of-the-art methods but also delves into future trends and challenges. From skill development and tools for intelligence systems to deep learning, machine learning, blockchain, IoT, and cloud computing, the book covers a wide range of topics essential to understanding and implementing secure e-governance systems. With its practical insights and interdisciplinary approach, this book serves as a vital resource for academics, researchers, and professionals seeking to navigate the complex landscape of e-governance security and leverage deep learning applications to protect valuable data and ensure the smooth functioning of government operations. © 2024 by IGI Global.
