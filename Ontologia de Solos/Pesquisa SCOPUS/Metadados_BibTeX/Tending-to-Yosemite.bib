	abstract = {This article is an investigation into the caring for landscapes in a time of accelerating change and the context of decolonising efforts. Care—as label, concept or set of practices—is complex, multifaceted, and plays a major role in determining how landscapes look and function across social, aesthetic, material, ecological, and political domains. Synthesising recent cross-disciplinary scholarship of care, I build a conceptual framework for the care of landscapes and apply that framework through a case study of land-fire stewardship and conservation efforts in Yosemite National Park, California, where I have conducted extensive fieldwork, interviews, and archival research. In discussion, I reflect on what was learned from this application, and in conclusion, put forth a set of salient questions, challenges and speculations on what the future of landscape care might become, in attempting to equitably adapt to changing climates and entangled social-ecological-political realities. © 2025 The Author(s).
