	abstract = {This article explores how the peasants organized in La Via Campesina, the world’s biggest social movement, fight the multiple crises of our time. Drawing on theories of prefigurative social change, we highlight how they enact the future in the interstices of the hegemonic now. With their everyday practices, the peasants grow not only food but also examples of less anthropocentric encounters with the non-human. We show that their farming against the neoliberal, postcolonial and extractive logics of the Anthropocene resonates with decolonial and indigenous critiques of the concept and that their care work for the non/human offers transformative examples of worlds yet to establish. © 2024 Mattersburger Kreis fur Entwicklungspolitik.
