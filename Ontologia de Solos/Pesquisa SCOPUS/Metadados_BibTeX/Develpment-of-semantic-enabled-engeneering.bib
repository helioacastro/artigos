	abstract = {Soil classification is the basic knowledge which a geotechnical engineer needs to have before embarking on the construction of projects like highway or metro construction. With the advent of semantic web technologies it is now possible for the humans and machines to collaborate by way of understanding the underlying meaning of the soil classification concepts. An innovative approach is discussed in this paper where artificial intelligence enabled soil classification is developed along with the visualization of particle size distribution curve using R language and owl technologies.
