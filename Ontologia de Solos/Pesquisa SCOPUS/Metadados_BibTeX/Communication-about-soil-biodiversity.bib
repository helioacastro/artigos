	abstract = {Given the urgency of the global soil degradation crisis, soil scientists must communicate the importance of soil as being part of nature and the critical need for conserving soil biodiversity. Drawing on a thematic analysis of editorials related to soil conservation and management, we analyzed common themes, key messages, and frames that authors used to advocate for change. Soil biodiversity was referred to in 8 of the 11 editorials, but it was less emphasized and discussed in less detail than messages centered around food production, water resources, and climate change. Editorials structured arguments around economic development, scientific and technical uncertainty, and morality and ethics. We believe future editorials should apply other persuasive frames including social progress, public accountability, and working-towards-compromise when advocating for soil biodiversity conservation. Soil ecologists can improve communications about soil biodiversity by (1) identifying an audience and selecting relevant key messages, (2) strategically applying a persuasive frame, and (3) amplifying diverse voices with a consistent message. We provide a guide for developing essays that encourages soil ecologists to shape discourse, advance policy priorities, and enable non-soil ecologists to communicate about soil biodiversity conservation. © 2024 The Authors},
