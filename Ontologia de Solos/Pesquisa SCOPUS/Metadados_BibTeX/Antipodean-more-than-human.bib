	abstract = {To be more-than-human is to be relational, to no longer see the human as a discrete individual and to recognise the multivalent agency and import of the non-human in bio-physical, socio-economic and cultural worlds. This Special Issue galvanises an interest by Aotearoa New Zealand geographers in non-human–human relations and delivers more-than-human research from the edges: of the discipline, from our geographic position antipodal to ‘the west’ and ‘the north’, from early career researchers and from cognate literatures at the periphery of geographic thought. The contributions here question understandings of ethics, politics, conservation and economy through papers that explore affect, care, agency, discourses and practices with a range of more-than-human subject-objects: blackberries, wine yeasts, insects, PFAS and urban streams. © 2023 The Authors.
