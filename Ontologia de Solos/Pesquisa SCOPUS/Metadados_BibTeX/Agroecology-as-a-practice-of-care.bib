	abstract = {This paper speculates on using blockchain and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in agroecological regeneration, focusing on the case of Spain's Mar Menor. It highlights the ecological challenges of intensive agriculture, drawing on theories like Haraway's cyborg metaphor and Latour's actor-network theory to contextualize the crisis within the interplay of human and non-human actors. The study introduces a conceptual blockchain-based prototype to automate ecosystem resilience through DAOs that manage land and agricultural practices. It proposes strategic interventions such as reforestation with nitrogen-fixing trees, cultivating flood-resistant crops, and the creation of new agro-settlements. The paper argues that blockchain technologies can optimize these strategies by enabling precise monitoring and management, thus enhancing soil fertility, sustainable agriculture, and community sustainability. It presents a vision of agroecosystems as resilient, autonomous entities capable of addressing ecological and economic challenges. © 2024 Owner/Author.},
