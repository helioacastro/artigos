	abstract = {Academic cooperation with African countries was enhanced by calls for proposals aimed at the internationalization of Brazilian universities, especially from the mid-2000s onwards. This process promoted the establishment of international research networks and collaboration between Brazilian and African graduates, especially with Portuguese-speaking countries. This dossier is an outcome of this process, presenting Cape Verdean studies, in dialogue with Latin American research and perspectives. The dossier brings together a set of texts that interweave some trends in feminisms of the global South with discussions on the relationship between colonialism and miscegenation. These different studies point to unusual possibilities of reflecting on modernity from the point of view of powerful disruptive feminisms that emerge from the experiences of the African global South. © 2022.
