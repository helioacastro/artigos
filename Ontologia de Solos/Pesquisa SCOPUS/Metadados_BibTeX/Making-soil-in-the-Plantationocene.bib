	abstract = {Based on 14 months of ethnographic research, this paper analyzes soil management within the plantation model of farmingin order to understand the extent to which life on large-scale monocultural farms can be controlled and directed toward extractiveproduction. Transnational soy farmers in Western Bahia Brazil ‘correct’ soils in the region to make them productive and marshal thisagronomic work to claim that they have added value to the land by ‘building it up’. Still, the permeability of the plantation keepstransnational farmers from achieving their dreams of control. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
