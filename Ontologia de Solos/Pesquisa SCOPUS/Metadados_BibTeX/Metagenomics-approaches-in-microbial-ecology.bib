	abstract = {• Technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are transforming research fields at the methodological, conceptual, and or-ganizational level. They open up new possibilities and bring with them new commitments and inherent limitations. We show from a philosophy of science perspective how NGS-based metagenomics has trans-formed microbial ecology and, with it, parts of agricultural soil science, which integrate ecological approaches with the aim to inform agricultural practices. We reconstruct agricultural science as design science (sensu Niiniluoto) and describe how the possibilities, commitments, and limitations of metagenomics approaches in microbial ecology shape values, situation assessments, and recommendations for inter-ventions of soil microbiology in the context of sustainable agriculture. © 2021, Oekom Verlag.
