	abstract = {Farmers’ perceptions of weather play an important role in shaping their responses to climate change. I combine assemblage theory, which focuses on the interactions between nonhuman and human entities as they co-function in space, with social network analysis to explore how small farmers’ interactions with nonhuman plants and animals inform their perceptions of extreme and variable weather across Oregon. While assemblage theory and qualitative methods provide in-depth details on farmers’ nonhuman interactions, survey and social network analysis highlight broader patterns across farmers’ assemblages. My results illustrate the critical role that human-nonhuman interactions play in shaping common perceptions of weather extremes and variability among farmers, regardless of their beliefs about climate change, and the importance of diverse nonhuman interactions for shaping such perceptions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},
