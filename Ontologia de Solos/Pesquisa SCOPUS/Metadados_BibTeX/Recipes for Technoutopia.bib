	abstract = {Through the performance of a radical brunch, this piece explores questions of inclusion, responsibility, labor, and care in the development of infrastructure, mirroring the many ways in which the promises of big data will solve pressing problems of participation, climate, and culture. By conceiving of infrastructure as experimental performance, I assert that infrastructure is experiential, sensorial, political, and situated. Through the performance, new rich understanding arises that connects infrastructural moments of breakdown, maintenance, and repair to the politics of the personal, orientation, and disorientation, uncovering a dissonance between the rhetoric of future-building and the sociomaterial realities of the present. If the recipe for the future is a technoutopia, this experimental performance asks: what are its ingredients and the labor of its production? Who is the chef, the served, the hungry? What spoils utopias? © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Hannah Star Rogers, Megan K. Halpern, Dehlia Hannah, and Kathryn de Ridder-Vignone individual chapters, the contributors.},
