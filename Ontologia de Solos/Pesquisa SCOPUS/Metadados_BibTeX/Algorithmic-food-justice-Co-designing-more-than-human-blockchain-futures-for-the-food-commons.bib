	abstract = {The relationships that constitute the global industrial food system tend towards two dominant values that are creating unsustainable social and environmental inequalities. The frst is a human-centered perspective on food that privileges humans over all other species. The second is a view of food as a commodity to be traded for maximum economic value, rewarding a small number of shareholders. We present work that explores the unique algorithmic afordances of blockchain to create new types of value exchange and governance in the food system. We describe a project that used roleplay with urban agricultural communities to co-design blockchain-based food futures and explore the conditions for creating a thriving multispecies food commons.We discuss how the project helped rethink algorithmic food justice by reconfguring more-than-human values and reconfguring food as more-than-human commons. We also discuss some of the challenges and tensions arising from these explorations. © 2021 ACM.},
