	abstract = {As societies become increasingly digitalized, the requirements for inclusion continuously increase. In a Swedish public, municipal, library context, it is common that individuals who face difficulties related to digital technologies come and ask for help. In this paper, we explore care in relations constituted by individuals and digital technologies and analyze how care matters for digital inclusion. It builds on field studies in a Swedish library context and includes qualitative interviews, focus groups, and observations of employees working to support individuals with digital needs. In order to analyze the material, we apply the concept of care. In the concluding discussion, we argue first for viewing individuals as sociomaterial entanglements of relations constituted by humans and non-humans, second that these sociomaterial entangled relations are vulnerable, shifting, and fluid, rather than stable, and third that these relations are in constant need of care.  © 2021 The Author(s).
