	abstract = {The article presents some reflections on how relationships involving cultivation of a community garden organized by young residents in the outskirts of the city of Praia challenge both historical processes of colonial agricultural production in Cape Verde, and the logic of modernizing development that marks contemporary understandings of food. Based on literature review and field research carried out in rural and urban contexts, the ethnographic notion of kumida di tera is taken as an expression that connects different insurgent food practices and knowledge, which are taken as references and reactivated through the relationships engendered in the community garden. Relationships that are considered here from the perspective of care, in the sense it has been conceived in contemporary sociology, as relationships that include aspects that have been neglected in the context of the dominant logics of food production and consumption. © 2022.
