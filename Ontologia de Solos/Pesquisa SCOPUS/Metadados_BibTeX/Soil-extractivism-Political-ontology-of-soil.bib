	abstract = {This article examines how specific (non-relational) political ontological understandings of soils are incorporated into industrial agricultural politics in the European Union and introduces a complementary contribution to existing literature with the concept of soil extractivism. The concept is used to describe current institutionalized ways of relating to soils and their dynamics of power. Through an integrative literature review, the article links existing research on soils with the development of modern agriculture in Europe. The theoretical contribution of soil extractivism provides a conceptual tool for understanding currently dominant ways of treating soils as a key part of modernity and industrial capitalism as well as part of wider destructions of multispecies relations. © 2024 The Author},
