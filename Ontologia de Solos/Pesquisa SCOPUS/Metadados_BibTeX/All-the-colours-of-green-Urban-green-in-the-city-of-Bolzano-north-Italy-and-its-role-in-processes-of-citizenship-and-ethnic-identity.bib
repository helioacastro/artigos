	abstract = {This article analyses how the perception and the practices related to urban green in the city of Bolzano (north-Italy) are implicated in processes of citizenship and ethnic identity, with special reference to colonial invasion of the area since the end of first world war. Through an ethnographic approach (part of a interdisciplinary project), the article illustrates how the way in which people in Bolzano make sense and use the urban green is the result of historically stratified influences that are entangled to contemporary reinterpretations made on the basis of actual socio-political challenges. The ethnography suggests that plants and parks are not simply a background to human affairs, rather, these participate to human undertakings with their specific spacetime. This makes, therefore, possible to imagine a new alliance between plants and humans to rethink civil society and citizenship in the city of Bolzano within and beyond the universalizing framework of the Anthropocene. © 2019, University of Palermo - Department of Culture and Societies.
