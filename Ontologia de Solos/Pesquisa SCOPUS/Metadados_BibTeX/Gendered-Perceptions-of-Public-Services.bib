	abstract = {Public services in Latin America face persistent challenges that affect access, quality, and fairness, particularly for women and marginalized groups. This study examines gendered differences in public service perceptions in Chile, focusing on quality, equality of treatment, and corruption in education, health, and law enforcement. Using data from the Index of Perceptions of Governance Quality at the Regional Level, we investigate whether women perceive public services more negatively than men and whether explanatory factors differ by gender. Employing linear, multilevel, and seemingly unrelated regression models, we analyze individual-level and municipal-level variables. Women report greater perceptions of inequality and corruption in health and law enforcement, with indigenous women expressing the most negative views. Female municipal leadership is associated with lower perceived corruption among women. These findings contribute to public administration scholarship by integrating care theory, representative bureaucracy, and policy feedback to inform gender-sensitive approaches to public service reform. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},
