	abstract = {Permaculture offers an ethical, pragmatic, philosophical and technical response to the daunting diagnosis of the Anthropocene. Its comprehension of the Earth draws upon the idea of “working with nature, rather than against it”. In that sense, permaculture radically departs from the fixist and homogenizing logics that prevail in agronomic sciences, and in modern territorial planning. By reengaging with the cycle of life and with our own finitude as living beings, permaculture conveys an earthly vision of human that resists the impertinent idea of an Earth becoming the scene solely for anthropos. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},
