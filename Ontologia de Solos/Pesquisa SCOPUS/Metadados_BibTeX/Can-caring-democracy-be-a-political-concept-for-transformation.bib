	abstract = {Departing from debates in the 1980s among feminist Marxists in Germany and American feminist theorists of care, the article situates the similar origins of ongoing debates regarding women's larger exclusion from social life. The argument compares the discussion on production/reproduction to the caring democracy approach currently being developed. Here, care is oriented toward relationships, while reproduction/production focuses on capacities. The article then provides an epistemological grounding for care as a type of expressive-collaborative moral theory according to terminology used by Margaret Walker. It develops and defends that the logic of care is ultimately incompatible with capitalism, yet also recognizes its limits.},
