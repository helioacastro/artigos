	abstract = {Historically, trade unions have been considered organisations belonging to the production space, so their role in the reproductive sphere has been understudied. In order to contribute to this issue, this study analyses how trade unions articulate the demands of the productive and reproductive spheres in a largely feminised industry. Through the case of the Chilean salmon farming industry, it is observed that women have increased their participation in labour unions since the 1990s, which has made it possible to include a gender perspective in their demands. In these contexts, the discussions about production are extendeded to issues of the reproductive sphere, such as maternity, care work, domestic violence and the obstacles they experience in their increased insertion into the labour market. Therefore, the trade union acts as a space that articulates the productive and reproductive spheres, where women who participate in the union leadership play a central role. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Rosario - Facultad de Humanidades y Artes, Escuela de Historia.
