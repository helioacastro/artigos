	abstract = {By way of combining insights from the emerging geosocial literature and feminist new materialism, the chapter develops a situated, ‘down-to-earth’ embodied perspective to investigate the lively relationalities of rocks and humans, and the way care is implicated in them. The analysis demonstrates that care is manifested in these relationalities in complex ways, taking the form of both detachment and entanglement, which do not exclude one another but instead contest an assumption of a harmonic relation between human and more-than-human subjects. Hence, the study provides a different story from that which is usually told about the Arctic area, of which the region studied is a part. © Anu Valtonen, Outi Rantala and Paolo Davide Farah 2020.
