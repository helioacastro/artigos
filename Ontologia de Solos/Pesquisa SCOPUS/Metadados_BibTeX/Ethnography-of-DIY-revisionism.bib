	abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of reburials as a manifestation of historical revisionism in Hungary, with a particular focus on their role in shaping national identity and iconography. The article explores the transformative nature of reburials, highlighting their role in reclaiming individuals as martyrs and as a tool for historical revisionism. The study draws on ethnographic research to provide insights into vernacular reburials and alternative commemorations, demonstrating how reburials can challenge established orders. Furthermore, the author introduces a new approach that emphasizes the active role of local agents and more broadly shows reburials and revisionism as contested processes involving multiple participants, including non-humans such as soil. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
