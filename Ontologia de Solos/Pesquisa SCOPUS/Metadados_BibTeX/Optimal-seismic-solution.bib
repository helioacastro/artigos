	abstract = {Based on the dynamic finite element theory, this paper establishes a fully coupled Mohr-Coulomb plastic finite element model of the soil ontology with the A metro station structure as the research object, conducts a nonlinear dynamic response analysis of the model structure, studies the variation of the seismic response of the model under different vibrations, soil material parameters and concrete parameters, and analyzes the influence of the station structure form on the displacement. In EL-2 condition, the first pair displacement of the S3 measurement point of the rectangular station is 5.695 mm, and the displacement of the arch-shaped station is 2.5 mm less than that of the rectangular station. The relative displacement of soil shear modulus with Gmax=200 MPa is 2.3 mm less than that of soil shear modulus with Gmax=80 MPa in the case of sidewall height of 3 m, which indicates that both the shape of station and soil stiffness has an effect on the seismic performance of the station. Influence on the seismic performance of the station. The research in this paper has an important reference value for the seismic design of underground frames of subway stations. © 2023 Hongshuo Sun and Hongtao Dai, published by Sciendo.},
