	abstract = {This article delves into the intricate dynamics of air datafication as matters of care within the distinctive context of air quality data politics in Poland. It focuses on the implementation of data-mediated care for air quality, scrutinizing two interconnected dimensions: data practices and data phronesis. The former involves the meticulous handling of air quality data, while the latter explores the phronetic valuation of more-than-human realms, including data standards, air sensing technologies, and a diverse array of actors integral to the datafication process. Data phronesis is conceptualized as the situated and context-dependent practical wisdom demonstrated by various actors, shaping the definition of ‘good’ data-mediated care for air quality. The article emphasizes the duality of care, highlighting the interplay between data phronesis and data practices. It underscores the ongoing negotiation surrounding air quality concerns, intricately mediated through data, within relational and contextual dimensions. Through an in-depth qualitative examination and Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four key themes, related to data-mediated air quality care, are identified: ‘caring about data,’ involving the valuation of situated data practices; ‘caring for data,’ translating polluted air into reliable data, while considering dominant standards; ‘caring by data,’ defining data usage methods within dynamic contexts; and ‘data for caring,’ exploring practical applications, particularly activist practices integrating diverse local contexts with European air quality standards. The article enriches our understanding of datafication as matters for care, shedding light on the interconnections between hands-on data practices and the contextual wisdom steering strategic action. © 2024 The Author(s).
