	abstract = {This chapter contributes to the theorisation of 'careful engagement' by exploring the affordances of the notion and praxis of response-ability for thinking about our engagements with the worlds of our enquiry. The present work stems from the recent upsurge of feminist new materialist and posthuman approaches that have spurred the reimagination of the ethics and politics of knowledge production and the rethinking of questions such as how we understand our role in shaping the world and with whom and what (else) we are engaging. These questions are underpinned by the understanding that knowing is a material doing with ethicality and care at its marrow. Inspired by this idea, this chapter employs the notion of response-ability to consider the ethics and politics of engagement in the authors' participatory research and development process. Returning to their efforts to engage well and with reflexive sensitivity-and to articulate this effort as they have done over the years-the authors draw on response-ability to better capture the intricacies and trouble at stake in enacting and embodying care in their engaged practice. With the help of response-ability, the chapter brings forth the layers of careful engagement that become unveiled when the focus is shifted from the autonomous, reflexively aware researcher to the intra-active dynamisms of the world. For careful engagement, slowing down with this unfolds as a matter of attentive curiosity, responsiveness and commitment to stay with the trouble of the complexities of engaging in and as part of the world. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.
