	abstract = {Today's ambitions for ecological and energy transition highlight the central role of the sites of production and extraction of natural resources, and connect soils and subsoils with technical, scientific, economic and political questions. As a result, soils and subsoils have been the subject of recent interest in science and technology studies (STS). This chapter begins by discussing the relationships between the critique of soil and subsoil sciences and (post)colonial issues. It presents works that have analyzed the transformation of soils and subsoils into resources. The chapter discusses the questions raised by the use of soils and subsoils in times of transition. Echoing Latour's invitation to develop a policy of the “terrestrial”, soils and subsoils open up stimulating avenues of research for STS, consisting of exploring the making of the territory, in all its material, epistemic, economic and social thickness, as well as attachments to it. © ISTE Ltd 2025.},
