	abstract = {How do social movements respond to the ecological crisis? In this chapter we aim to develop an understanding of contemporary socio-ecological movements starting from their capacity to instigate material transformations. We reframe social movements as 'more-than-social movements' to highlight that many contemporary mobilisations do much more than targeting recognised social institutions and political governance; they are practically transforming eco-societies within and with both the human and the nonhuman world. What constitutes the core of more-than-social movements action is the capacity to set up alternative forms of mundane existence and alternative politics of matter. By transforming the ways through which heterogenous entities relate to each other, these movements generate alternative ontologies of existence and generative and reparative practices of justice. We engage with the imaginaries and practices of agroecology, AIDS treatment activism and permaculture to rethink what autonomy might look like in more than human worlds.},
