	abstract = {In the last few years, pronouncements of ‘insectageddon’ or the ‘insect apocalypse’ in media and academe have raised the alarm about the loss of insect biodiversity. Such reports have engendered dispute and action, with much of each orienting around honey bees. In this chapter, I explore more-than-human temporalities through examination of how time becomes made among honey bees and their keepers. Beginning with a reflection on spending time with bees, the spectres of life and death provide a guide through the stories told of (among other things) catastrophe and loss, slow violence and quick kills, and learning to coordinate tempos and rhythms. Such livings and tellings travel not only with bees and keepers, but resound in broader considerations of human-nonhuman relations and responsibilities.},
