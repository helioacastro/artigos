	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable that influences the redistribution of the radiant energy and the runoff generation and percolation of water in soil. Knowledge of soil moisture temporal-spatial variations is important in a wide range of studies. This study aims to investigate the temporal-spatial variations of soil moisture using microwave polarization difference index (MPDI). The AMSR-E/Aqua Daily Global Quarter-Degree Gridded Brightness Temperature at 10.65 GHz channel was used to calculate the MPDI. In addition, the AMSR-E/Aqua Daily L3 Surface Soil Moisture was used in this study. The temporal and spatial patterns between the MPDI and soil moisture were analyzed. The results indicate that the temporal and spatial patterns of the MPDI are consistent with those of soil moisture. The MPDI reflects the temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture. © 2014 IEEE.},
