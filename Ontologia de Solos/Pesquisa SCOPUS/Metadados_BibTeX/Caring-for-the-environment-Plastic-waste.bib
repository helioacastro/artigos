	abstract = {A study was conducted with coffee growers from the municipalities of Caldono (Cauca) and Pitalito (Huila) in Colombia. Workshops, participant observation and farm visits were used to identify elements to understand (a) practices to the care of the environment, (b) the perception of the use of plastic materials, and (c) perspective toward biodegradable packages in their practices. Among the main results are an awareness for the care of the water resource and the care of the trees as its main contributions to the protection of its environment. In both communities, the problem is perceived due to the management of plastic waste and its influence on environmental deterioration due to poor management. They also recognize that the development of biodegradable bags can contribute to caring for their environment and make their economic activity more sustainable. © 2024 American Anthropological Association.},
