	abstract = {Determining brain tumors from MRI can be challenging due to several factors, and it typically requires expertise in neuroimaging and collaboration between radiologists, neurologists, and other specialists. Some tumors may have a subtle or a typical appearance on MRI, making them difficult to distinguish from normal brain tissue. Brain tumors can be highly heterogeneous in terms of silhouette, scope, and internal structure. Tumors can have different types of tissues, such as necrotic and enhancing regions, making it challenging to accurately delineate their boundaries. Brain tumors can be highly heterogeneous in terms of silhouette, scope, and internal structure. Tumors can have different types of tissues, such as necrotic, cystic, or enhancing regions, making it challenging to accurately delineate their boundaries. Deep learning has shown promising results in various medical imaging tasks, including the identification and classification of brain tumors, such as gliomas, from MRI images. In this paper, an attempt to design an ensemble model for the prediction of 3D brain tumor segmentation and performance is going to be evaluated using deep learning models such as UNET, FPN, and UNET+FPN. The above models are evaluated on the BraTS 2021 (Brain Tumour Segmentation) dataset, and comparing the metrics of each model reveals that UNET and, an enhanced model that combines UNET and FPN, UNET+FPN has the highest accuracy of 0.9959 and 0.9954 respectively. © 2024 IEEE.},
