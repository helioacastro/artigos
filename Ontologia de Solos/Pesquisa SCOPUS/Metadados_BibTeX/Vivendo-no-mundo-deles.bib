	abstract = {This text derives from the intentions of a ethnographic immersion project carried out in virology laboratories and their translation interfaces with scientific dissemination. It is a tentative and experimental essay on how scientific practices can instill imaginative transformations in the relationships between the different beings that share the Earth in what we call education. I propose to use the image living in their world in order to interrogate how colonial troubles make the curriculum equivalent to a project for the formation of the human subject. From intertwined stories, the argument explores, on the one hand, how the humanist autocracy fails to take advantage of the inconstancy of the animated materiality of the soil when struggling against the loss of a safe or stable terrain. On the other hand, it indicates how scientific controversies testify to a communication problem regarding the geontological appeal of printing to education the work of coordination and coexistence between multiple intimate encounters. In dialogue with feminist and queer studies, complicated by neomaterial and posthuman perspectives, I defend the reassessment of the relationship between education, geology and ecology as a condition for thinking ethical and political responses to the ongoing destruction. © 2020 Curriculo sem Fronteiras.
