	abstract = {This paper throws light on how mobility is practiced as a unique form of care by the Rabari pastoralists of Gujarat. The Rabari-camel pastoralist communities traverse the arid lands of Western India to ensure the health of the camels, the vitality of the environment and the economic and social sustenance of the Rabari. It shows the ways that mobility is co-constituted, embodied and enacted as an inextricable relationship between the pastoralists, the animals and the environment. Through the practice of multi-species - mobility the conceptual and sensually experienced landscapes merge into the ‘milieu’. It shows how the dynamic, sensory and material Rabari ‘milieu’ is threatened by mainstream spatial politics, and sedentist, dualist imaginaries. Finally, it examines how reciprocity and care is leveraged as a adaptation and survival mechanism under growing pressures. © 2025 Landscape Research Group Ltd.},
