	abstract = {Performing Climates features 14 interconnected chapters exploring theatre and performance’s relationship with more-than-human elements at a time of climate emergency. The book argues that Western performance – how we conceive of it, as well as how we train and educate people in and about it – needs to reorient its ways of making and thinking about itself to reconsider patterns of breakdown, decay and renewal happening on and off stage in a literal play of cells and particles. Performing Climates examines live performance as a uniquely compostable artform, formed by sonic vibrations and movements of air and matter, more-than-human elements, composition and decomposition. This book will appeal to undergraduate audiences, postgraduate scholars and performance studies colleagues, offering exciting possibilities for reconsidering theatre and performing in an age of crisis. © 2025 Eddie Paterson and Lara Stevens.},
