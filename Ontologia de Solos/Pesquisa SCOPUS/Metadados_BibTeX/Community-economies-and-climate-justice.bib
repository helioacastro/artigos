	abstract = {Climate change appears to act as a metanarrative of concern linking different areas of political–economic activism with environmental justice movements. Community economies' scholars would certainly agree with Naomi Klein's call for action and appreciate the devastating impact of human life on the planet, yet they significantly depart from the politics that comes with capitalocentric thinking on climate change. The generational yardstick offers an alternative view to "big" governmental change and also gets activists away from the paralysis that comes from focusing on the need to change a "capitalist" system. An entry point to collective change making in response to climate change, has been developed through recent work on the commons. The commons is a central theme within the climate justice movement with several different meanings. Another community economies entry point to thinking about economic life in a time of climate change, and in particular exchanges with the more-than-human world, is perhaps surprisingly though research on the species-being of humans. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Stefan Gaarsmand Jacobsen; individual chapters, the contributors.},
