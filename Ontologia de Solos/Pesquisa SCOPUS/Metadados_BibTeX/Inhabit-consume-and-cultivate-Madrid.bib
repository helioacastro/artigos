	abstract = {In this context of eco-social crisis, eco-transformation narratives currently imbue institutional programs and the agendas of social organizations and movements. These narratives set out to promote practices to guarantee sustainable living and redefine the relationships between society and nature, based on interdependence and eco-dependence. This article first explores the sociopolitical context in which these narratives take place, and the ecotransformation processes involved. It then analyses the "eco-transformative capability" of specific collective initiatives, presenting three case studies: neo-ruralisation processes and organic wine production in the Sierra Oeste of Madrid and the southern Sierra de Gredos, agroecological provisioning systems in Catalonia, and the urban community gardens integrated into the Madrid Municipal Program. This analysis focusses on the motivations, challenges, and limitations that stakeholders find in putting into practice sustainable living, production and consumption, and in their relationships with public institutional agendas regarding eco-social transition. © 2024 Federacion Espanola de Sociologia.
