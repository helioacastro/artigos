	abstract = {In 2015 and 2016 more than a million people sought refuge from conflict and hardships in Germany. While the response was ambivalent, across the country large networks of supporters formed, offering various kinds of assistance to the arriving persons. This book takes these developments as a starting point. It reports on an HCI project, building on the emancipatory traditions of Participatory Design and the Socio-Informatics approach, aiming to develop assistive technologies for forced migrants as well as their supporters. It focusses on the design process and reflects on the nature of intervening through participatory design in matters of migration and arrival. The work draws on feminist conceptualisations of care and outlines how care and participation interacted in this context to support the longterm maintenance of the design results, but also how care relations between the different participant groups undermined the democratic aims of participation. It draws out preliminary lessonsfor an interventionist HCI practice. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature 2024.},
