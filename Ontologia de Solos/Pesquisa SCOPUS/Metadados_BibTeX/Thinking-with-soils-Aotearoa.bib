	abstract = {In this commentary, we reflect on our work with an urban youth farm where young people (re)connect to the food system. Participating in everyday soil creation and care activities nurtured new relationships with more-than-human ecologies and beings at an urban farm called Cultivate Christchurch. In this farm, participants engaged with soils and the process of making and regenerating soil from food waste via composting. We ask whether such activities can begin to help participants think with soil rather than about it, and to heal the ‘metabolic rift’, the socioecological disconnect from food growing and nutrient cycles. © 2023 The Authors.
