Human-managed-Soils;Human-managed soils and soil-managed humans: An interactive account of perspectival realism for soil management;Kendig, Catherine;2024;Journal of Social Ontology;https://doi.org/10.25365/jso-2024-7690;"""soil ontology""";;;;;;;"What is philosophically interesting about how soil is managed and categorized? This paper begins by investigating how different soil ontologies develop and change as they are used within different social communities. Analyzing empirical evidence from soil science, ethnopedology, sociology, and agricultural extension reveals that efforts to categorize soil are not limited to current scientific soil classifications but also include those based in social ontologies of soil. I examine three of these soil social ontologies: (1) local and Indigenous classifications farmers and farming communities use to conceptualize their relationships with soil in their fields; (2) categorizations ascribed to farmers in virtue of their agricultural goals and economic priorities relied upon in sociological research; and (3) federal agency classifications of land capability employed by agricultural scientists. Studying the interplay of these social ontologies shows how assessing soil properties and capabilities are the result of previous agricultural strategies informed by culture, agroecological history, weather, soil biodiversity, crop rotation, and the goals held by decision-makers. The paper then identifies the soil relationships and interactions that constitute ontology-making activities. Building on recent work, I outline a novel interactive account of perspectival realism grounded in agricultural extension research and ethnopedological data that captures the haptic nature of farmers’ soil strategies. This interactive account explains how ontologies are chosen, why they are chosen, and how they interact and inform soil management decision-making. The paper concludes by examining the values laden in these ontologies and those which are causally implicated in the choice of soil management strategies. © 2024 Author(s) published by the Journal of Social Ontology.";;;

In EL-2 condition, the first pair displacement of the S3 measurement point of the rectangular station is 5.695 mm, and the displacement of the arch-shaped station is 2.5 mm less than that of the rectangular station. The relative displacement of soil shear modulus with Gmax=200 MPa is 2.3 mm less than that of soil shear modulus with Gmax=80 MPa in the case of sidewall height of 3 m, which indicates that both the shape of station and soil stiffness has an effect on the seismic performance of the station.

";"Aplicações de Ontologia de Solos em Agricultura de Precisão; Modelagem Semântica de Solos";;;;Farming is regarded as a major industry in India, accounting for 17% of the country's GDP growth. Agriculture employs 60% of the population hence it is considered an important sector in India. The important factors for agriculture are pest management, disease prevention, irrigation management, soil mineral composition, crop management, location, and the season in which the crop is grown. Hence all this information along with the techniques are well known only by the experienced farmers. Hence it is important to create an agro knowledge management system. As a result, this work makes an attempt to develop a multiple ontology-based agro knowledge management system. The designed system consists of agriculture information related to attributes of soil mineral, moisture, season, location, crop type, and temperature. It consists of multiple ontologies such as soil ontology, crop ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology to provide agronomy knowledge. Soil ontology is premeditated to classify the soil type in a hierarchical order while crop ontology classifies the crop type, location ontology classifies locations suitable for different crop types and finally, crop season ontology classifies the season that is suitable for different crops. A rule base is built to develop the knowledge base and to validate the truthfulness of the knowledge base. Visualization of a knowledge base is carried out for better understanding and decision-making. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

";"Aplicações de Ontologia de Solos em Agricultura de Precisão; Modelagem Semântica de Solos";;;;The quality of agriculture depends on the quality of the yield, which is usually obtained through the well-being of the crop. The quality of any crop depends on the minerals in the soil, the type of soil, the location, and the seasons. The crop yield depends on soil fertility, availability of water, climate, and disease prevention. Although this information is prevailing in plenty among the expert farmers, the means of abducting the information to the future generation has not been much promoted. Hence, the knowledge disseminated regarding agriculture becomes scarce, affecting the entire agricultural process. Given these facts, a single source, strong knowledge management system is proposed to be designed. The system aims to embrace the different kinds of knowledge associated with agriculture and attempt to obtain a single source of agro information that is very much usable and reusable to the users. To ensure the maximum level of reusability, the knowledge of the domain needs to be modeled and represented in a way that is scalable and flexible. One of the knowledge representation techniques that emphasizes on reusability and scalability is ontology. Thus, this paper attempts to design an ontology-based agro knowledge management system. A rule base is constructed to improve the expressiveness of the knowledge. An incremental mining approach is adopted to extract the knowledge from multiple ontology. To understand better to aid decision-making, a visualization task is carried out. A multi ontology-based knowledge mining model is attempted in this research to provide better insight regarding agro knowledge. © 2023 IETE.;;;Sim

";"Modelagem Semântica de Solos; Aplicações de Ontologia de Solos em Agricultura de Precisão";;;;Soil health plays a vital role in agriculture. A nutrient-rich soil helps in better crop growth and high yield. The agriculture data in India is haphazard and no major effort is seen in maintaining them. Soil chemical property is a basic knowledge to decide on cultivation. Knowledge base to help farmers analyse the soil health by using the chemical properties as the main feature in predicting the health and quality of the soil before the cultivation is a key factor for a better production result. This study drives the idea of building a domain ontology model for soil and also utilizes a neural network in predicting the soil by classifying it as healthy or unhealthy based on six chemical parameters that explain the property of soil. Ontology plays as a knowledge base in storing the properties of the soil which also helps in enabling artificial intelligence concepts on the knowledge to make better decisions. MATLAB deep learning toolbox is used to implement the classification and also TensorFlow's Keras was used to handle the data pre-processing, normalization and also the network architecture to validate the result from the toolbox. MATLAB employs the Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm and performs with 92% accuracy in achieving the classification of soil. © 2022 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.;;;Sim
Ontofusioncrop;OntoFusionCrop: An Ontology Centric Approach for Crop Recommendation Based on Bagging and Semantic Alignment;"Chandramouli, Aparna; Deepak, Gerard";2022;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-02447-4_22;"""soil ontology""";;;;;;;Agriculture is a crucial source of livelihood. There are many farmers who take up farming as their main source of income. The major difficulty present among farmers is that their crop selection is not based on the soil and weather conditions. Thus, it is essential for farmers to know the necessary information regarding the different facets of crop production, best agricultural practices, suitable crops for a specific soil type to be grown in a particular weather, etc. A crop recommender system, which has accurate and precise information, serves as a means for the farmers to farm appropriate crops and get the best yield. This paper proposes an ontology-based recommender system to provide the appropriate details regarding crops and other information associated with them. The proposed OntoFusionCrop uses ontology cluster that includes soil ontology, crop ontology, geographical ontology and agricultural ontology. This strategy uses the crop recommendation dataset from Kaggle which is classified using bagging. The classified instances along with the ontology cluster are semantically aligned using spider monkey optimization algorithm from which we get facts after suitable verification. The query is asked by the user and the recommender system gives the output. The proposed model achieved 93.87% accuracy and A minimum of 0.05 FDR compared to the existing models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;;

";Outros;;;;As environmental matters, soils have been an object of inquiry primarily for the natural sciences, with social scientists and environmental humanities scholars occupied with the surface dramas of territory and its products. The invisibility of soils in much of public and intellectual life speaks not only to the literal invisibility of their subterranean elements but also to their taken-for-granted effectiveness as the material infrastructure of societies. Today's crisis of soil ecosystems calls for an urgent examination and improvement of human-soil relations. This is both an intellectual and a practical project. The authors believe that a crucial first step toward more just and sustainable human-soil relations is a critical reflection around soil knowledge practices and their onto-political effects. In this introduction, they open the field for such reflection by denaturalizing the category soil, discussing its complex materialities, its multiple scales, and the diversity of existing soil ontologies and epistemologies. In so doing they argue for a relational materiality approach to the study of soils. The authors place this relational materiality approach within a practical, political, and ethical project of re-embedding societies in soils and lands. Finally, they indicate emerging arenas of inquiry where a relational materiality approach to soils is needed. © 2020 Anna Krzywoszynska and Greta Marchesi.;;;Sim

";"Modelagem Semântica de Solos; Outros";;;;The dominant drive for understanding soil has been to pace its fertility with human demand. Today, warnings about soil’s exhaustion and endangered ecology raise concerns marked by fears of gloomy environmental futures, prompting scientists and soil practitioners urgently to develop better ways of taking care of soils. Yet the pace required by ecological soil care could be at odds with the predominant temporal orientation of technoscientific intervention, which is driven by an inherently progressivist, productionist and restless mode of futurity. Through a conceptual and historical approach to the soil sciences and other domains of soil knowledge, this article looks for soil ontologies and relations to soil care that are obscured by the predominant timescape. Contemporary discussions of the future of the soil sciences expose tensions between ‘progress as usual’ – by intensifying productivity – and the need to protect the pace of soil renewal. The intimate relation of soil science with productionism is being interrogated, as ecology attempts to engage with soil as a living community rather than a receptacle for crops. In this context, and beyond science, the ‘foodweb’ model of soil ecology has become a figure of alternative human–soil relations that involve environmental practitioners in the soil community. Reading these ways of making time for soil as a form of ‘care time’ helps to reveal a diversity of more-than-human interdependent temporalities, disrupting the anthropocentric appeal of predominant timescales of technoscientific futurity and their reductive notion of innovation. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015;;;Sim

Soils are a fundamental part of the environmental information requirement, and appropriate soil data and information are crucial to support evidence-based policy, planning and resource management decisions. For data to be useful, one basic requirement is that they be interpretable. Sufficient information should be provided to allow data to be unambiguously interpreted and used. Examples of such information include the location at which the soil was sampled, the property that was measured, the unit of measure, and quality assurance and quality control information. Furthermore, data should be easily integrated with other data sources, which is required in many modelling applications. For example, simulation of crop production may require, besides soil data, also weather, crop and fertilizer data. To meet these requirements, we have developed a soil ontology for modelling soil information. In this paper, we focus on the design of the ontology and its potential applications. We describe the use of the ontology to facilitate data access by mapping data to the ontology and making them available as Linked Data. We also discuss applications of the ontology for data integration, data classification and data validation. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

";Outros;;;;In the factory production of Lyophyllum decastes, inappropriate cultivation environments can lead to appearance quality issues, which in turn affect both yield and quality. However, the appearance characteristics of Lyophyllum decastes influenced by environmental factors share similarities, and the environmental factors that cause appearance quality problems exhibit coupling and complexity. Therefore, the identification of appearance characteristics and tracing of environmental factors present significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal learning network, DCRes-GAT, which integrates an improved Residual Neural Network (DCResNet) and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to accurately identify the features of Lyophyllum decastes, while simultaneously tracing environmental factors and providing control recommendations. First, a knowledge graph based on the prior knowledge of quality and environmental factors is constructed, mapping this information to a point space and extracting key features. Next, DCResNet is employed to extract optical features from Lyophyllum decastes images. In addition, the receptive field is expanded through dilated convolutions, while pixel-level details are preserved, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is incorporated to identify subtle visual differences. Finally, a dot product operation fuses point-space features with visual features, achieving accurate identification of characteristics and providing suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that the DCRes-GAT model performs excellently, with a feature identification accuracy of 99.45%, and can precisely diagnose key environmental factors that cause appearance quality problems, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 99.84%.

Research on flexible systems frequently confronting perplexing disturbances can utilize this method to simplify irrelevant items as a single variable. In this paper, we focused on vibration control problems in flexible systems with the application of ADRC and constructed a second-order system model under the guideline of fundamental principles of ADRC and an innovative algorithm for tuning feedforward compensation ADRC. During the simulation, we discussed three cases in which each solely one parameter varies while others are kept invariant.

";Aplicações de Ontologia de Solos em Agricultura de Precisão;;;;Effective management of plant diseases and pests requires knowledge that covers multiple domains. At the same time, retrieving the relevant information in a timely manner is always challenging, due to the unstructured nature of agricultural data. Over the years, efforts have been made to develop an ontology-based Decision-Support System (DSS) to facilitate the diagnosis and control of plant diseases. Some major issues with these systems are that: (1) they do not adopt the full extent of the ontological constructs to represent domain entities, which, in turn, reduces reasoning capabilities and prevents systems from being more intelligent, (2) they do not adequately provide the desired level of knowledge to support complex decisions, which requires many factors to be considered, (3) they do not adequately explain or provide evidence to demonstrate the validity of the system's outputs. To address these limitations, we present a novel system termed Agriculture Ontology Based Decision Support System (AgrODSS), which aims to assist in plant disease and pest identification and control. AgrODSS architecture consists of two semantic-based models. First, we developed Plant Diseases and Pests Ontology (PDP-O) to capture, model, and represent diseases and pest knowledge in a machine-understandable format. Second, we designed and developed an Evidence-Based Explanation Model (EBEM) that points to related evidence from the literature to demonstrate the validity of the system outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgrODSS by executing various queries via AgrODSS SPARQL Endpoint and obtaining valuable information to support decision-making. Finally, we evaluated AgrODSS practically with domain experts (including entomologists and pathologists) and it produced similar answers to those given by the experts, with an overall accuracy of 80.66%. These results demonstrate AgrODSS's ability to assist agricultural stakeholders in making proper disease or pest diagnoses and choosing the appropriate control methods. © 2024;;;Sim

";"Modelagem Semântica de Solos; Estudos de Caso e Implementações";;;;"The availability of satellite imagery to ""domain"" experts, along with advancements in image processing and analysis techniques, has revolutionized numerous fields, enabling better understanding, planning, and management of our planet's resources. However, formalizing the knowledge gained from domain experts is essential for preserving, sharing, and leveraging their expertise. In this context, knowledge representation methods like ontology play a significant role in the development of applications based on satellite image analysis. Land cover labeling is one of the significant applications of satellite image analysis and plays a vital role in various domains by providing valuable information about the Earth's surface. Although several works have been reported to focus on land cover land use classification and labeling, very few are properly documented or formalized. Therefore, in this paper, an LCL (land cover labeling) ontology has been proposed for labeling the land cover classes using PALSAR-I satellite data. The ontology is based on an adaptive algorithm, as the labeling criterion is independent of specific range values and depends on feature image statistics. For algorithm development, four types of features, namely, polarimetric features, texture features, color features, and wavelet features were examined. For selecting optimal feature set, random forest was utilized and, consequently, for further labeling the classes a set of rules has been formed by applying Otsu thresholding on the selected class-wise feature sets. The derived rules were finally formalized to develop the ontology for labeling the land cover classes. The proposed ontology was applied to distinct study sites using PALSAR-I data which resulted in a satisfactory classification accuracy of around 85%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.";;;Sim

";Aplicações de Ontologia de Solos em Agricultura de Precisão;;;;The highest challenge humankind is facing in the current time period is the enormous population growth and the need to meet the food and nutrient to the population. To meet the enormous production, the farmers are more relayed on the usage of chemicals to increase the food production during the cultivation process. Inclination towards chemical fertilizers is because of their popularity and availability, the over usage of these chemicals is a root cause of many major problems like nutrient-less crops, soil quality degradation, and environmental hazards in the long run. The availability of a knowledge base of the soil quality parameters and their related organic fertilizers according to the farmer's region can decrease the inclination towards the utilization of chemical fertilizers and adopt the usage of organic fertilizers. To help in this process of a major change in farming we built an ontology oriented deep learning model which recommends the farmers in choosing the best organic fertilizers based on the soil quality. The domain ontology construction for agriculture is based on semantic language which can be reused in the future. The knowledge base is then utilized by the deep learning model to process the data and recommend the best suitable fertilizers. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

]";;;;;Soil is an essential part of urban foodscapes. While community gardens have received attention as parts of this foodscape, the role of experienced gardeners in the everyday transformation of human-soil relations is underexamined. This paper traces an action research project aimed at connecting human-soil relations with the “30 by 30” national food security policy that is part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Based on a collaboration initiated by a community group with the National Parks Board of Singapore, this paper introduces the concept of “soil companions”, and presents the qualitative findings of a larger 36-month study. It examines the practices of experienced gardeners who build soil as bioinfrastructure. A thematic analysis of interviews with five soil companions–gardeners employing soil regeneration practices–in Singapore was conducted. We discuss the ecological and social dimensions of their practices, and implications for soil and food security policies for an increasingly urban world. We raise future directions for research on foodscapes, public health, and global commodity chains. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.;;;Sim

We offer this notion as a complement to ongoing efforts of invigorating cultural ecosystem services (CES) with relational and embodied approaches. Through a transdisciplinary and mixed methodology of soil arts that includes artist-led open stages, ecosystem conviviality is explored through soil-centered practices in urban gardening and art. The chapter attends to how gardeners situate themselves not as receivers or producers of services but as entangled co-creators of open-ended ecosystems. This in turn calls attention to a needed shift in CES focus, from benefits and human well-being to considering ecosystem relations and values as embodied co-becomings, with consequences for sites, people, and soils alike. The aim of the situated practice-theory of soil arts that this chapter presents, is to offer new perspectives and methods for those involved with planning and management of urban ecologies, and others seeking more integrative ways of grappling with socioecological challenges and uncertainties. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Pamela D.

]";;;;;"This paper highlights the need to consider the processes and relations in the political, knowledge, technical and socio-material complex that underpins the emergence of a soil-based carbon economy. This economy, characterised by the proliferation of voluntary soil-based carbon markets, carbon farming policies, supply chain and other initiatives, operates through private mechanisms (offsetting, insetting) and public policy instruments. This emerging economy entails a number of inherent political and knowledge contestations associated with claims around the mitigation potential of soil carbon sequestration and carbon farming. We adapt a social ecological systems (SES) framework to understand these contestations and draw on a corpus of agricultural, ecological, political and social science literatures to identify and pose critical questions for future research. We conceptualise the emerging soil-based carbon economy as interactions and outcomes among actors embedded within a defined SES (governance, resource systems, resource units, actors). Five themes are identified: Marketisation, abstraction and technogovernance; Power relations and expert knowledge; Disputing the meaning and value of soil carbon; Disruptions: new interfaces, configurations and actor relations; Uncertainties and capabilities. These underpin a research agenda proposal. We argue that an integrative conceptualisation is essential to equitably account for the broad mix of social, technical, economic, political, and ecological contexts in which soil carbon is embedded and present options for operationalising the conceptualisation. © The Author(s) 2025.";;;Sim

]";;;;;This paper conceptualises droughts as socioecological phenomena coproduced by the recursive engagement of human and non-human transformations. Through an interdisciplinary approach that integrates political ecology, material geographies and hydroclimatology, this work simultaneously apprehends the role of politics and power in reshaping drought, along with the agency of biophysical processes – soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate – that co-produce droughts and their spatiotemporal patterning. The drought-stricken Ladismith in Western Cape, South Africa, is the instrumental case study and point of departure of our empirical analysis. To advance a materiality of drought that seriously accounts for the coevolution of biophysical and political transformations, we alter the spatiotemporal and empirical foci of drought analyses thereby retracing Ladismith’s socioecological history since colonial times. In turn, such extended framework exposes the agency of soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate and their metabolic exchanges with processes of colonisation, apartheid, capitalist and neoliberal transformations of South African economy. We argue that the narrow pursuit of profits and capital accumulation of the few has produced a fundamental disruption between nature and society which contributed to transform Ladismith’s drought into a socioecological crisis. Whilst advancing debates on materiality, we note two fundamental contributions to the study of drought. First, our approach makes hydrological accounts of droughts less politically naive and socially blind. Second, it develops a political ecology of droughts and socioecological crises more attuned to the materiality of drought. We contend that apprehending the materiality of drought and the active role of its non-human processes can further understandings of the workings of power and the production of socioecological injustices. © The Author(s) 2022.;;;Sim

Soil is connected to major sustainability issues as it is life-essential to a wide range of beings. Soil is rarely thought of as heritage, despite becoming a scarce resource over time. It is argued that heritage as ‘landscapes of human perception’ is not enough to meet the challenges at hand, whereas the alternative ‘heritage as phenomena’ allows for discussing the long-term material/immaterial multi-species interrelations that build up in situated soils. It gives better positions to discuss justice and care between generations and convivial re-generation of landscapes. The paper works with a case study from mid-Sweden to show how different ‘agential-cuts’ of soil give rise to stakeholder tensions as different worlds are produced. © 2024 The Author(s).

Drawing on an ethnographic study in 2 Australian cities–Sydney and Canberra, this paper identifies the emergence of a “composting ethic” among participants that is animated by three forms of learning and doing: (1) noticing and attending, (2) embodying and (3) experimentation. Fieldwork analysis is contextualised in relation to literature from the environmental humanities, discard studies and learnings from First Nations Australians and their ontologies. By bringing these empirics, key literature and ontologies together, this paper aims to deepen understanding of the opportunities and challenges of community composting to reduce negative environmental impacts and support anti-colonial practices of discard. It does this by identifying the characteristics of a composting ethic and the contexts and skills capable of nurturing its emergence. Attention is also paid to what may limit realisation of such an ethic. Overall, this paper aims to generate further applied academic understanding about the unique role–and possibilities–of efforts to revitalise and grow city soils and advance anti-colonial food waste management through community composting. © 2024 The Author(s).

It explores how soil, as both a biophysical and socio-political entity, alternates between being treated as lively or inert in response to the demands of capital. The study explores three cases: a soil mixing facility in New Jersey, the regional extraction of sand, and the municipal Clean Soil Bank program. By integrating scholarship on urban metabolism and the metabolic rift, the article challenges reductionist and technocratic perspectives framing soil as a passive substrate, emphasising instead its dynamic role in urban life and agrarian urbanism. The findings reveal how soils, shaped by socioecological histories, resist simplistic binaries of life and nonlife, offering new possibilities for understanding the interplay between urbanisation, ecological relations, and political economy. © 2025 The Author(s).

As a result, soils and subsoils have been the subject of recent interest in science and technology studies (STS). This chapter begins by discussing the relationships between the critique of soil and subsoil sciences and (post)colonial issues. It presents works that have analyzed the transformation of soils and subsoils into resources. The chapter discusses the questions raised by the use of soils and subsoils in times of transition. Echoing Latour's invitation to develop a policy of the “terrestrial”, soils and subsoils open up stimulating avenues of research for STS, consisting of exploring the making of the territory, in all its material, epistemic, economic and social thickness, as well as attachments to it. © ISTE Ltd 2025.;;;

]";;;;;Soil is being refigured across academia and society at large as a significant and lively yet fragile actor. Caring closely for soil appears increasingly vital to organizing sustainable and equitable economies, food systems and urban development. Soil is becoming a touchstone for a relational ethics of careful organizing with Earth’s non-human inhabitants, also encompassing animals, oceans and atmospheres. In this essay-style article I think with soil to problematize this wider relational ethics. My critique starts by explaining how soil has become central to this relational ethics and then recognizes that soil often does not fit within human narratives of attentive care. I read such soil refusals as an earthly invitation to explore forms of soil organizing that develop moral arguments for profound detachments and exclusions from non-humans. Exploring two such examples – Indigenous farming and proposals for soilless food production – I elaborate an alternative ‘more-than-relational’ ethics. This is an approach to non-human ethics where sometimes non-humans, like soil, are never known at all or become known only to then be ignored. Such a more-than-relational ethics acknowledges that while attentive care is preferable to ethical approaches that exploit non-humans, it is not sufficient to organize a more sustainable, prosperous and equitable planet. Thinking with a more-than-relational ethics instead acknowledges the moral case for profound exclusions and detachments of non-humans that do not serve attentive care but can help multi-species flourishing in a time of planetary ecological crises. This novel approach to ethics contributes to organizational theory by radically problematizing prevailing scholarship valorizing ever closer knowledge of non-humans and their practices of organizing. Instead, scholars should also explore knowledges and practices, including Indigenous ones, that can help us detach from and ignore some non-humans. © The Author(s) 2025.

]";;;;;This article contributes to the growing literature on human-soil relations by exploring how care for agricultural soils unfolds among farmers who engage with alternative agricultural practices across different productions and sites in Norway and Costa Rica. These farmers approach soil as a living being and seek to approach care with macro- and microorganisms in response to soil challenges and economic instabilities. The article follows recent literature on soil care in showing how agricultural practices challenge the dominant approach to soils as passive. However, the article argues the necessity of expanding on existing notions of care. This, I argue, involves ethnographically “unearthing” care: unpacking and situating a diversity of soil care practices, their human and other-than-human entanglements, and how these relations are conditioned by environmental, genealogical, sociocultural, temporal, epistemic, economic, and political mechanisms within and beyond the farm. Considering these variables is essential to keep soil care in the emerging literature from following a romanticizing path toward abstract individualism. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;"carbon sequestration; climate change; combustion; environmental justice; fossil fuel; perturbation; soil carbon";There is growing interest in enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) as a climate mitigation strategy, including neutralizing atmospheric emissions from fossil-fuel combustion through the development of soil carbon offset markets. Several studies have focused on refining estimates of the magnitude of potential SCS or on developing methods for soil carbon quantification in markets. We call on scientists and policy makers to resist assimilating soils into carbon offset markets due to not only fundamental flaws in the logic of these markets to reach climate neutrality but also environmental justice concerns. Here, we first highlight how carbon offset markets rely on an inappropriate substitution of inert fossil carbon with dynamic stocks of soil carbon. We then note the failure of these markets to account for intersecting anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle, including the soil carbon debt and ongoing agricultural emissions. Next, we invite scientists to consider soil functions beyond productivity and profitability. Finally, we describe and support historical opposition to offset markets by environmental justice advocates. We encourage scientists to consider how their research and communications can promote diverse soil functions and just climate-change mitigation. © 2024 The Author(s).

]";;;;"United Kingdom; agricultural management; Anthropocene; empirical analysis; farming system; plantation; spatiotemporal analysis";With its focus on the species level of the Anthropos, there is growing concern that the Anthropocene analytic lacks the conceptual nuance needed to grapple with the unevenly distributed harms and responsibilities tied up with issues of biodiversity loss, global warming, and land use change. Conceptual variants like the patchy Anthropocene have been proposed to better capture the justice implications of these socio-ecological crises, directing attention to their spatially ubiquitous yet context-specific character. The figure of the plantation has come to play an important role in this scholarship due to the contribution intensive agriculture had made to these interlinking crises. Through empirical study of the regenerative agricultural movement, this paper reflects on how regenerative farmers use different sites (fields, soils, livestock stomachs) to apprehend their agro-ethical responsibilities to more-than-human actors both near to and far from the landscapes they manage. Our aims here are two-fold. First, we provide a more affirmative account of agricultural management than is currently offered by plantation farming: a model of food production that is not just ‘in’ the Anthropocene, but ‘for’ it. Second, we contribute to ongoing discussions unfolding in the social sciences around the tools needed to conceptualise the interlinking spatial and justice aspects of the Anthropocene transition. By bringing the patchy analytic into conversation with more established geographic writing on scale, volume, and horizontal connections, we show the merit of juxtaposing multiple models of spatial relation as a way of gaining ethical and conceptual traction on complex socio-ecological issues. We argue that the ‘polymorphic’ spatial imaginaries of regenerative agriculturalists can offer some guidance on the tools needed to attend to the specificity of local Anthropocene outcomes in relation to socio-ecological forces actuating the world at much greater spatio-temporal scales.

Soil is the loose mineral or organic material comprising three phases solid, liquid, and, gaseous, found on the surface of the earth (ontology), resulting from weathering processes through interactions of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere (epistemology) serving as a habitat for micro and macro-organisms, plants, and animals, and ultimately supporting human life and civilization (axiology). This simple definition brings more attention to human soil interactions and build sustainable solutions for soil and civilization in the future. © 2024;;;Sim
Relationships-regeneration-Great-Plains;Relationships of regeneration in Great Plains commodity agriculture;"Snorek, Julie; Freidberg, Susanne; Smith, Geneva";2024;Agriculture and Human Values;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10558-3;snowballing Toward-relational-materiality;;;;;;;In recent years regenerative agriculture has attracted growing attention as a means to improve soil health and farmer livelihoods while slowing climate change. With this attention has come increased policy support as well as the launch of private sector programs that promote regenerative agriculture as a form of carbon farming. In the United States many of these programs recruit primarily in regions where large-scale commodity production prevails, such as the Great Plains. There, a decades-old regenerative agriculture movement is growing rapidly, but not due to the incentives offered by companies’ carbon programs. On the contrary, farmers are adopting regenerative practices to cut their dependence on corporate agrochemical inputs and expertise, and to thereby achieve technology sovereignty. These practice changes often strain farmers’ existing social relationships while drawing them into new and previously neglected ones, including the more-than-human relations necessary for building soil health. These new relationships and the knowledge they generate may in turn lead farmers to think differently about their own autonomy. These findings provide insight into farmers’ skepticism of private sector carbon farming programs, and highlight the value of attention to the multiple types of relationship change that accompany and facilitate regenerative transitions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.;;;

]";;;;;This chapter argues that the relational materiality of water - co-emergent between water's biophysical characteristics and its sociocultural situatedness - impacts the unfolding of gender and livelihood dynamics in specific contexts. Taking the case of semi-arid areas of Maharashtra, India, this chapter examines processes of rural transformation through the lens of a transition between two waters moving across the landscape, probing the resulting shift in gender labor relations. Building on ethnographic fieldwork in two regions, one where livelihoods are dependent on monsoonal rainfalls and another where farmers use wastewater irrigation, we focus on three more-than-human elements at play in this transition: water solutes and sediments, soil organisms and goats. Exploring these as our analytical entry points, we reveal the importance of reconceptualizing labor as a more-than-human relation to better understand how agrarian environments are reshaped by irrigation infrastructure projects. In a feminized agriculture sector, where ecologies are enrolled into processes of agrarian transformation, this perspective problematizes narratives of efficiency behind their stories of successes, demanding metrics that capture the invisibilized work people and their ecologies do together. Further, this work contributes to scholarship on water's materiality, demanding that we engage with the obligations of our more-than-human relatedness to bridge feminist struggles with environmental concerns. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Tatiana Acevedo-Guerrero, Lisa Bossenbroek, Irene Leonardelli, Margreet Zwarteveen, and Seema Kulkarni.

]";;;;;The relationship between humanity and the soil is an increasingly important topic in social theory. However, conceptualisations of the soil developed by anticolonial thinkers at the high point of the movement for self-determination between the 1940s and the 1970s have remained largely ignored. This is a shame, not least because theorists like Eric Williams, Walter Rodney, Suzanne Césaire and Amílcar Cabral were concerned with the soil. Building on recent work on human-soil relations and decolonial ecology, we argue that these four thinkers conceptualised the connection between soil, empire, and anticolonial revolt. Williams and Rodney ground understanding of soil degradation in global relations of economic power, while Césaire and Cabral reconceptualise postcolonial nationhood in terms of the mutability and diversity of the soil. The article concludes by suggesting that these two anticolonial counterpoints, global connectivity and more-than-human identification, anticipate and deepen contemporary attempts to decolonise ecological thinking. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

Second, the article situates its analysis of the war's environmental impacts directly in relation to transitional justice.

It analyzes rituals involving the physical manipulation of soil across Greek, Roman, Jewish, and early Christian traditions. Through a thematic examination of practices such as burial, mourning, purification, healing, and symbolic transfer, the article identifies two primary, often overlapping, symbolic dimensions: soil signifying lowliness, humility, dirt, and purification (often 'placeless' soil), and soil representing specific, potent locations such as homeland, sacred sites, or burial grounds ('placed' soil). Significantly, rituals manipulating soil rarely centered directly on agricultural fertility, diverging from interpretations focused solely on earth goddesses. This provides some insights for contemporary relationships with soils. © Moshe Blidstein, 2025.;;;

This article examines this trend in Southeast Asia, reviewing the history and contemporary dynamics of wetland restoration in the region. Drawing from literatures on the political ecology of restoration, infrastructure studies, and the financialization of nature, we understand wetland restoration as a form of repair to highlight it as a socio-political process. We conceptualize restoration as infrastructurallandrepair, the process of restoring dynamic ecosystems for specific anthropocentric and economic aims, mediated through an amalgam of expertise, technology, and finance. We reveal how restoration can function as a socio-ecological fix, maintaining the same political-economic systems that initially caused wetland degradation. Finally, we identify a need for three areas of scholarship to be expanded on how restoration unfolds in practice within the SEA context, which will be crucial to informing more reparative forms of restoration. © The Author(s);;;Sim

This article uses decolonial analysis to examine the racial-colonial foundations that underlie contemporary efforts to reuse former U.S. military land for development projects. Interrelating scholarship on security and development with that of militarization and political ecology, I use “geosocial spectacle” to probe the material and pedagogical governance, frontier logics, and colonial aesthetics that emerge through land remediation and redevelopment. Featuring two military sites within U.S. base closure and realignment—the U.S. Front Range area of Colorado and former U.S. unincorporated territory of the Panama Canal Zone—the article delineates and expounds on two types of U.S. military land conversions: brownfields and biodiversity recreation. The article interrelates the conversion of contaminated land in both cases as waste frontier that facilitates ongoing cycles of land repossession as a form of dispossession and containment or denial of war. The article concludes by advocating for decolonial studies of the global color line entrenched by the U.S. Pentagon’s ongoing climate colonialism, to subvert the compartmentalized harms of war and capitalist extraction, and to galvanize explicitly anticolonial, antiracist land reuse and governance. © 2024 by American Association of Geographers.;;;

The distributed design approach, which focuses on enriching the existing bioinfrastructure of the soil, emerged out an ongoing research project in the Conca de Barberà, Spain. The project involves managing an interconnected series of currently unproductive on unmaintained fields through the rotational grazing of horses, with the hypothesis that the systematic grazing regime will catalyse soil biological activity. By attending to the soil infrastructure, the project necessarily developed a unique design approach. Management decisions became design problems and design work took on something of the call and response of management. Though it was shaped by the specific constraints and opportunities of the research project, the methodology is applicable to a wide variety of design projects in extensive landscapes with limited resources. © 2024 The Author(s).

What the microbes in these products are, though—that is, how they are enacted—varies across regulatory, research and development, and growing spaces, and that variation matters to how they are regulated. From document analyses, interviews, and ethnographic work with scientists, growers, and policy actors, we find that these microbes are epistemically uneven, sometimes with pinned-down identities, and sometimes with loosely woven textures with holes.

]";;;;;There is great diversity in the methods, terms, and empirical focuses employed by social and natural scientists working on agroecological transitions. The upshot is that whilst various researchers may nominally be putting their shoulder to the same agroecological wheel, the impact of their combined efforts is not what it might be. The aim of this article is to assist in the co-ordination and collaboration of disparate research activities and actors. It does so by offering the readers of this journal a user-friendly guide to some of the terms being used by social scientists (particularly human geographers and anthropologists) in their work on pests, diseases, crop protections and agroecological transitions. Such a document is of particular use as the terms and concepts employed by social scientists are equipped to generate analysis with explicit political insight in a way that those used by natural scientists may not be. The concepts and theories of social scientists foreground the commonalities that cut across case studies which might otherwise seem separated by a reservoir of context specificity. Tooled with these terms of analysis, the promise of agroecology rightly becomes something with far reaching political and justice consequences. These terms are presented across five areas: the ontological, the epistemological, the methodological, the historical, and the aesthetic. Given the range of social, ecological, cultural, and economic barriers involved in effecting an agroecological transition, it is vital that different researchers are conversant in each other’s language.

]";;;;;This paper examines the making and remaking of Taiwan's banana export market in response to the devastation caused by an outbreak of a novel infectious plant disease, Fusarium wilt disease Tropical Race 4 (TR4, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense). Taiwan was the world's fourth-largest exporter of bananas in the 1960s before the collapse of the market in the early 1970s. While scholars have drawn on actor-network theory-inspired performativity approach to understand the role of non-human actants in market-making, insufficient attention has been given to the distinct impacts of microbes on cases such as that of Taiwan's banana export market. Microbes’ creative and ever-evolving qualities constantly present challenges related to the control and containment of such non-human entities, for which no pre-existing or universally applicable solutions exist. Consequently, there is a lack of research that provides useful frameworks to understand such disease-plagued markets. To bridge this gap in the literature, we examine the remaking of Taiwan's banana export market in the aftermath of the TR4 crisis using a case study approach and develop the notion of pathological markets. Inspired by recent scholarship on biosecurity and related care practices, we outline two characteristics that shape pathological markets: (a) speculative and probiotic care practices and (b) the rescaling of market organisations. The results of the fieldwork conducted as part of the present study in laboratories, government offices and on banana farms lead us to contend that the growth and development of particular microbes in multispecies environments such as Taiwan's banana farms constantly pose significant challenges for market farming. Moreover, to co-exist with the threats posed by the growth and development of microbes such as those which cause Fusarium wilt disease TR4, growers in Taiwan's banana export market rely heavily on probiotic and speculative care practices. © The Author(s) 2023.;;;Sim

The concept is used to describe current institutionalized ways of relating to soils and their dynamics of power. Through an integrative literature review, the article links existing research on soils with the development of modern agriculture in Europe. The theoretical contribution of soil extractivism provides a conceptual tool for understanding currently dominant ways of treating soils as a key part of modernity and industrial capitalism as well as part of wider destructions of multispecies relations. © 2024 The Author;;;Sim

]";;;;;This paper speaks to the uneven scholarly attention gone into tracing dominant forms of water governance as opposed to practices crafting alternative human-water relations on the ground. Through the case of an Indian-based network mobilising to transform how we understand rainfed regions as rain-dependent socio-ecologies, I theorise their action ‘with care’, a commitment to think-with grassroots movements as actors capable of bringing new worlds into being. Describing their activities as worlding-practices, I explore how the network confronts the invisibilities inscribed by the current paradigm reducing water to irrigation by defining alternative metrological tools that recentre the governance of water from the perspective of the rainfall. Tinkering with the variables of the constituted metrology, the network utilises an atlas, a formula, and an acronym to enact a different rainfed sociality into being, creating visibilities and cares for neglected things. Through the story of a grassroots group and their strategies of mobilisation, this account contributes to debates on how to pluralise water governance, suggesting that reimagining its practices requires taking seriously the performativity of grassroots knowledges. Building alliances between research and activism as e/affective world-building partners becomes key to co-theorise liveable human-water relations and caring socio-ecologies at large. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

To contextualize the political and epistemological significance of air in urban contexts, we suggest looking at the under-researched experience of premodern cities and bodies, how they developed a complex ecological imagination and solutions guided by findings from Hippocratic-Galenic medicine. While we do not romanticize these efforts, we argue that they represent an overlooked archive through which the post-Enlightenment mechanization, securitization and abstraction of air can be challenged. Turning to recent findings from both more-than-human thinking and microbiology as applied to air (aerobiome), we acknowledge that microbiome science is a result of laboratory science; however, we argue that findings from microbiome science point to a reanimation of air as something that cannot be fully instrumentalized or securitized as in modernistic programs of biopolitical control. By drawing on the on the experience of the Hippocratic tradition as a catalyst and a proxy for wider ontologies of flows and corporeal porosity across the Eurasian landmass, we suggest arriving at an affirmative reconceptualization of human-environment entanglement based on notions of permeability and a non-binary ontology of flows. This more-than-human approach may not only complicate the alleged simplistic view of the “West” as a dualistic monolith but act also as bridge and companion to Indigenous and Southern ontologies and experiences of life, non-life, matter and nature. © 2024 American Association of Geographers Published by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.";;;

]";;;;"Finland; Italy; Norway; agricultural land; agriculture; empirical analysis; ethnography; landscape; rural landscape; soil carbon";In the face of diverse socio-ecological crises, regenerative agriculture promises to enliven rural landscapes by positioning farmers as key actors in mitigating the ‘carbon problem’ on the one hand, and adapting to it on the other. This article troubles ways of knowing regenerative agriculture through soil-and-carbon centered representational knowledge practices. Conceptually, we build on relational scholarship and use the concept of (un)knowing landscapes to suggest that agricultural landscapes both become, and become (un)known in and through diverse more-than-human relations. Empirically, we draw from ethnographic fieldwork independently conducted at farms in Finland, Norway and Italy practicing diversified regenerative agriculture. By focusing specifically on the practices of composting and processes of decomposition, we show how farmers come to know and reciprocate the aliveness of their landscapes through both proximate and distant relational dynamics: balancing between control and cohabitation, caring for and taking care of, and attending to multiple rhythms of (re)production. We argue that placing a deeper focus on soils — even when representing them differently — not only risks making proximate relations in diversified regenerative agricultural landscapes unknown, but also permits these landscapes to become known primarily through relations of distance. This, in turn, enables the commensurability of regenerative agricultural landscapes into tradable units for carbon markets. We conclude that transformation towards ecological livelihoods requires a radical reevaluation of, and accounting for, diverse more-than-human landscape relations. © 2023 The Authors;;;Sim
Multiple-worlds-and-strange-objects;Multiple worlds and strange objects: environmental education research as an additive practice;"Rautio, Pauliina; Hohti, Riikka; Tammi, Tuure; Ylirisku, Henrika";2022;Australian Journal of Environmental Education;https://doi.org/10.1017/aee.2022.29;snowballing Toward-relational-materiality;;;;;;;The paper offers three examples of passionate immersion with strange objects and working with peculiar multispecies assemblages, such as the assemblage of a dove called Romeo and the technology to humidify a greenhouse called 'Princess', or the experiment of orienteering in forests for years, accounting for slips, scratches and tumbles as being taught by the forest - and prioritising these over the more commonplace educational narratives. The paper is structured in a nonconventional way in that most space is reserved for reports from these ongoing inquiries. The authors will each discuss how they situate themselves in relation to strangeness in research and how they proceed methodologically, locating their approaches as postqualitative. The questions each example addresses are: What is a strange object? How do we come across them? What do we begin to do/produce with them? The additive orientation described in the research stories is proposed to be an important constituent for new survival knowledge especially relevant for environmental education, addressing environmental problems as wicked, and demanding approaches that reach beyond methodological divides.  © The Author(s), 2022.

]";;;;;Looking at soils from the perspective of an environmental scientist or agronomist might neglect various dimensions of valuation that can be attributed to soils. Especially social and cultural connoted values including ecosystem services cannot always be measured in terms of scientific values or classified as soil types or soil qualities in a modern, economic way. Even though soils are a fact and have been present on the Earth's surface and used by people, at least for food production, at different times and in different cultures, the ways of dealing with soils and the valuations of soils are extremely diverse. Researchers in anthropology, archaeology, and agriculture, for example, are investigating different perspectives like soils as common good or as private property. This concerns not only different knowledge orders about soils, but also beliefs, techniques, foodways, practices, and power relations concerning soils and cereal cultivation. Based on the example of agriculture with a focus on cereal cultivation, we argue that there is still a great need for interdisciplinarity between the sciences and humanities. However, there is also a need to distinguish and explain between fundamental interdisciplinary research and application of findings in a socio-economic context. It is necessary to understand different knowledge orders and valuations in time or space and to reevaluate today's perspectives on soils and agriculture for facing modern problems such as soil degradation, erosion, salinization, and an overall loss of soil fertility. © 2022 The Authors.

This chapter explores the emplaced, affective, and ethical dimensions of human-soil relations in urban home and community gardens through ethnographic fieldwork, demonstrating that the fundamental interdependence of human and soil health and wellbeing makes soil a fertile focus for investigation. Soil not only shapes the productive capacities of gardens and sustains urban green spaces; biodiverse soil has also been shown to have direct health benefits. On the flipside, the presence of contaminated, toxic soils - most prevalent in lower socio-economic neighbourhoods - exposes inequities in access to safe gardening sites and the realisation of their potential therapeutic benefits. Seizing on the growing emphasis on therapeutic spaces as relationally produced, this chapter contends that the therapeutic benefits of gardens are best realised when human participants cultivate attentive, responsive relationships with the myriad multispecies companions that mutually co-produce these sites. To do this, the chapter explores how a multispecies justice framework can be enacted in therapeutic garden landscapes to maximise human and multispecies health and wellbeing. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Pauline Marsh and Allison Williams; individual chapters, the contributors.";;;

In this chapter I suggest that this focus on experience and experimentation is vital within broader ecologies of ‘mending’ environmental damage, and to the ideas of ecological reparation put forward by this book. Specifically, I suggest that the loop of collective reflection on experience afforded by the examples I document in El Salvador allow for a supplementation of official histories with small stories; with purposefully censored collective memory; and with everyday expertise. The case presented in this chapter is engaged in experimental soil repair through composting practices and the creation of ‘biofertilizers’ – recipes that use local organic ingredients to boost soil health. I show how agroecological approaches to soil repair place campesino expertise at the heart of agricultural innovation and ecological reparation. Together, these fuller archives allow for a wider array of possible solutions to soil damage, while also enabling contestation to take place over stories told over land, ownership, lives, and communities. © 2023 Bristol University Press.";;;

In Iitate, a former evacuation zone where radiation still lingers, farmers and concerned citizens deploy a coproduction framework that involves experts in making their own science. Incorporating tactile knowledge of the environment, they make life-strengthening claims on the future amid state promises of revival and progress. Soil becomes alive in madei, which emerges from the processes of separating radiocesium from topsoil, growing rice, and other improvisations for relating to soils that cascade to regenerate a livable world. This article discusses how the Japanese state utilizes temporal scales that orient its citizenry to a future associated with accelerated and intensified productivity as a sign of progress, incorporating decontamination technologies to assert control over organic lives and inorganic matter to make them productive for humans. Through madei, this article addresses how soil guides human attention to the rediscovery of interspecies temporalities, paces, and rhythms, reconfiguring radioactivity to create what I conceptualize as a regenerative time to underscore how actors reanimate the future(s) in the here and now. © 2023 Mankei Tam.;;;Sim

]";;;;;In this commentary, we reflect on our work with an urban youth farm where young people (re)connect to the food system. Participating in everyday soil creation and care activities nurtured new relationships with more-than-human ecologies and beings at an urban farm called Cultivate Christchurch. In this farm, participants engaged with soils and the process of making and regenerating soil from food waste via composting. We ask whether such activities can begin to help participants think with soil rather than about it, and to heal the ‘metabolic rift’, the socioecological disconnect from food growing and nutrient cycles. © 2023 The Authors.

In these contexts, however, scientists remain the focal storytellers. This article offers our methodology for researchers and communities to share narratives with each other and then to engage in collaborative storytelling. At the center of this work is how the humanities embrace the importance of narratives having gaps—narrative lacunae into which individuals can insert their experiences, needs, and values. Our storytelling- and gaps-based methodology allows communities and researchers to enter and transform each other’s stories. We offer a simulation model that fosters collaborative storytelling and give examples from the storytelling and social-environmental action projects that have emerged over three years of partnership with communities and university students. © 2023 Linda Shenk, Kristie J.

]";;;;;This text derives from the intentions of a ethnographic immersion project carried out in virology laboratories and their translation interfaces with scientific dissemination. It is a tentative and experimental essay on how scientific practices can instill imaginative transformations in the relationships between the different beings that share the Earth in what we call education. I propose to use the image living in their world in order to interrogate how colonial troubles make the curriculum equivalent to a project for the formation of the human subject. From intertwined stories, the argument explores, on the one hand, how the humanist autocracy fails to take advantage of the inconstancy of the animated materiality of the soil when struggling against the loss of a safe or stable terrain. On the other hand, it indicates how scientific controversies testify to a communication problem regarding the geontological appeal of printing to education the work of coordination and coexistence between multiple intimate encounters. In dialogue with feminist and queer studies, complicated by neomaterial and posthuman perspectives, I defend the reassessment of the relationship between education, geology and ecology as a condition for thinking ethical and political responses to the ongoing destruction. © 2020 Curriculo sem Fronteiras.

In the U.S., its development as an idea has parallelled mid-twentieth-century territorial struggles in Alaska and is inextricably linked to permafrost science and frontier engineering. Permafrost is more than a scientific category and engineering risk subject to correction and control; it is a foundation for dynamic socioecological and cultural expressions in arctic landscapes. In response, a relational approach is taken to examine permafrost’s cold, vibrant and plural materialities, with an aim of generating design possibilities that are attuned to these dynamics. In the Arctic where science continues to play a central role in determining putative futures, the article further suggests to creatively instrumentalise scientific forms of landscape inquiry, highlighting thermo-material interactions and multiplicities of arctic ground. © 2020 Landscape Research Group Ltd.";;;

Often labelled elsewhere as 'cultural ecosystem services', these NCP provide a range of benefits that are mostly non-material, non-consumptive and intangible. The review finds that NCP framings help to highlight how soils have contributed to inspiring learning and creative works, like art; to mental and physical health benefits, such as through recreation and gardening; and to cultural identities and practices, including religious practices and efforts for social justice. Overall, soils have played a large role in human creative endeavours, are the root of significant relationships to the environment and can be conceptualized through key metaphors, ideas and theory as a bridge linking culture and nature together. Yet despite the wide-ranging contributions of soils to these NCP, the literature remains uneven and much more remains to be understood, including how relational values of care and stewardship with soils can be fostered and how attention to the co-produced 'biosocial' nature of soil can help improve practices for soil health.

Seein-copiaposols-anthropogenic-soils;Seeing copiapósols: anthropogenic soils, strategic unknowing, and emergent taxonomies in northern Chile;"Ureta, Sebastián; Otaegui, Alvaro";2021;Agriculture and Human Values;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10191-4;snowballing Toward-relational-materiality;;;;;;;In recent decades, anthropogenic soils have become so ubiquitous that for some authors they should be taken as the “golden spike” signaling the start of the Anthropocene. Despite their prominence, leading soil taxonomies have resisted calls to recognize them as a proper kind of soil. Such omission has importantly limited the ways in which soil practitioners can account and deal with the sociopolitical aspects embedded in soil formation. Approaching the issue from a sociomaterial perspective, this paper studies the effects of such omission on the work of soil scientists working in northern Chile. By contrasting their usage of the USDA/NRCS soil typology with the realities found in the field, the work of strategic unknowing that such typologies achieve becomes evident. To challenge such situation, the paper concludes exploring the notion of emergent taxonomies, classifications that are sensitive to local configurations of materials, living beings and power out which soils emerge. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.;;;

We examine the biophysical aspects of the economy and the huge amounts of materials and energy the global economy consumes to achieve growth. Thus far, governmental responses have been incapable of addressing the underlying structural issues of the global textile industry and the accompanying exploitation of nature and peoples. While the necessary deep structural transformations are difficult to achieve through governmental policy change, we suggest that re-localisation of wool production-consumption networks is an expression of how engaged citizens can build more sustainable textile and fibre alternatives in place. Drawing on local food research, this chapter highlights the dangers of conflating local solutions with sustainability. Instead, we argue that assessing these emergent wool ventures based on how they are organised in the living landscape in specific places will enhance the understanding of what kind of socioecological impacts they can achieve. This includes how organising/connecting the activities and visions of wool entrepreneurs in place is essential if these ventures are going to be able to overcome the barriers set by the dominant growth-based system of global trade. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2022.;;;
Environmental-racism;‘When you heal the soil…’: Environmental racism and socioecological repair in contemporary urban agriculture;Shostak, Sara;2022;Environmental Sociology;https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2022.2073626;snowballing Toward-relational-materiality;;;;;;;Drawing on data from an ethnographic study of urban agriculture in Massachusetts, this paper investigates the multiple meanings of soil for contemporary urban farmers and gardeners. I first consider how urban farmers speak for and with the soil in their neighborhoods to call attention to historical and ongoing environmental racism. These narratives highlight how racialized social processes–including redlining, blockbusting, white flight and disinvestment–have harmed the health of both people and the environment in urban communities of color. I then describe how urban farmers and gardeners articulate the importance of soil for health and well-being, especially for people whose relationships with the earth have been disrupted by capitalism, colonialism and racism. These narratives draw on both scientific and spiritual frameworks to highlight the healing potential of re-establishing direct relationships with nature, reclaiming ancestral knowledge about the healing properties of plants, and reconnecting with the ancestors themselves. Analysis of these interlinked narratives contributes to an emerging cross-disciplinary scholarship on the situatedness of ways of conceptualizing and interacting with soils, calling attention especially to the role of racialized inequities in the creation of harmful soil materialities and the possibilities of socioecological repair. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;;;

]";;;;"Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; antiinfective agent; animal; antibiotic resistance; human";Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often framed as a One Health issue, premised on the interdependence between human, animal and environmental health. Despite this framing, the focus across policymaking, implementation and the ethics of AMR remains anthropocentric in practice, with human health taking priority over the health of non-human animals and the environment, both of which mostly appear as secondary elements to be adjusted to minimise impact on human populations. This perpetuates cross-sectoral asymmetries whereby human health institutions have access to bigger budgets and technical support, limiting the ability of agricultural, animal health or environmental institutions to effectively implement policy initiatives. In this article, we review these asymmetries from an ethical perspective. Through a review and analysis of contemporary literature on the ethics of AMR, we demonstrate how the ethical challenges and tensions raised still emerge from an anthropocentric framing, and argue that such literature fails to address the problematic health hierarchies that underlie policies and ethics of AMR. As a consequence, they fail to provide the necessary tools to ethically evaluate the more-than-human challenges that the long list of actors involved in managing AMR face in their everyday practices. In response to such shortcomings, and to make sense of these challenges and tensions, this article develops an ethical framework based on relationality, care ethics and ambivalence that attends to the more-than-human character of AMR. We formulate this approach without overlooking everyday challenges of implementation by putting the framework in conversation with concrete situations from precarious settings in West Africa. This article concludes by arguing that a useful AMR ethics framework needs to consider and take seriously non-human others as an integral part of both health and disease in any given ecology.  © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

]";;;;"culture; diet; food consumption; human geography";Veganism is the subject of an increasingly diverse body of social scientific research, yet it remains relatively understudied in geography. Meanwhile, contemporary cultural commentaries note how veganism has gone mainstream, with critics warning of veganism’s corporate nature – expressed in the rise of what we term ‘Big Veganism’. We argue that food geographers are well placed to examine these trends. We first review vegan studies work beyond geography that examines and critiques the mainstreaming of veganism. We focus on literature that explores multiple contested modes of veganism, veganism as praxis in place and the rise of corporate veganism as useful foundations for geographers to build on, particularly in light of currently unfolding developments in vegan cultures and practice. Taking this work forward, we identify four conceptual traditions from research in food geographies – following foodways, alternative food networks and the cultural and material politics of eating – to develop a ‘vegan food geographies’ programme that aims to advance critical geographic work on veganism and the emerging implications of its contemporary mainstreaming. © The Author(s) 2022.;;;Sim

]";;;;"business; ecological economics; empirical analysis; ethics; profitability; sustainability";Sufficiency can be understood as the endeavors of economic actors to fulfill needs by delivering only what is necessary. This interpretation reveals a relationship between sufficiency and care economics, as both advocate for a need-centered economy. This study demonstrates the influence and support of care on the performance of sufficiency. It is divided into two parts: (1) the development of a care framework that describes the meanings and enablers of care, and (2) the analysis of empirical data from 14 sufficiency-oriented businesses from a care perspective using the care framework. The findings indicate that from a care perspective, the world is a network of vulnerable and interconnected beings who require individuals to engage in care relationships and activities. Time, financial resources, knowledge, collaboration, technologies, and narratives are essential enablers of care and, as the findings demonstrate, contribute to the implementation of sufficiency. This study proposes a novel narrative of sufficiency as a matter of care and encourages future scholars and practitioners to understand sufficiency orientation as part of a care economy—one that fulfils the needs of society over targeting profit maximization. © 2024;;;Sim

Yet, these trade-offs and justice implications remain entrenched in an anthropocentric orientation, which is problematic in ecological and ethical terms. We discuss four common assumptions on trade-offs in NBS (instrumentalism, neutrality of science, collaborative consensus, and unitemporality) and rethink them through a multispecies justice lens, maintaining that dealing with trade-offs is a form of interspecies politics. © The Author(s) 2025.;;;Sim

]";;;;;Soil is an essential part of urban foodscapes. While community gardens have received attention as parts of this foodscape, the role of experienced gardeners in the everyday transformation of human-soil relations is underexamined. This paper traces an action research project aimed at connecting human-soil relations with the “30 by 30” national food security policy that is part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Based on a collaboration initiated by a community group with the National Parks Board of Singapore, this paper introduces the concept of “soil companions”, and presents the qualitative findings of a larger 36-month study. It examines the practices of experienced gardeners who build soil as bioinfrastructure. A thematic analysis of interviews with five soil companions–gardeners employing soil regeneration practices–in Singapore was conducted. We discuss the ecological and social dimensions of their practices, and implications for soil and food security policies for an increasingly urban world. We raise future directions for research on foodscapes, public health, and global commodity chains. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.;;;Sim

]";;;;;Soil is being refigured across academia and society at large as a significant and lively yet fragile actor. Caring closely for soil appears increasingly vital to organizing sustainable and equitable economies, food systems and urban development. Soil is becoming a touchstone for a relational ethics of careful organizing with Earth’s non-human inhabitants, also encompassing animals, oceans and atmospheres. In this essay-style article I think with soil to problematize this wider relational ethics. My critique starts by explaining how soil has become central to this relational ethics and then recognizes that soil often does not fit within human narratives of attentive care. I read such soil refusals as an earthly invitation to explore forms of soil organizing that develop moral arguments for profound detachments and exclusions from non-humans. Exploring two such examples – Indigenous farming and proposals for soilless food production – I elaborate an alternative ‘more-than-relational’ ethics. This is an approach to non-human ethics where sometimes non-humans, like soil, are never known at all or become known only to then be ignored. Such a more-than-relational ethics acknowledges that while attentive care is preferable to ethical approaches that exploit non-humans, it is not sufficient to organize a more sustainable, prosperous and equitable planet. Thinking with a more-than-relational ethics instead acknowledges the moral case for profound exclusions and detachments of non-humans that do not serve attentive care but can help multi-species flourishing in a time of planetary ecological crises. This novel approach to ethics contributes to organizational theory by radically problematizing prevailing scholarship valorizing ever closer knowledge of non-humans and their practices of organizing. Instead, scholars should also explore knowledges and practices, including Indigenous ones, that can help us detach from and ignore some non-humans. © The Author(s) 2025.

The diversely positioned authors discuss this idea using the subject of soil, in the place and context of Aotearoa New Zealand. Little is known about the diversity of ways that everyday people value, or, have caring relationships for/with soil, among a plethora of research that positions soil ‘care’ around, for example, commercial food production, waste-sinking, or property land value. To study diverse care in relation to soil, as with many relational subjects, requires equivalent diversity in the ways in which we might explore it. Here we outline the basis for diverse, situated methodologies that necessarily lead to a diversity of methods. This paper looks at the methodological imperatives that lead to exploring care, and discusses a variety of methods that generate different forms of ‘data’ with different forms of representation of that care. We observe that to holistically observe care relations with soil requires a diversity of methodologies, inherently ontological and epistemological – worldmaking. We discuss situated and enactive, affective approaches of Kaupapa M?ori enquiry, monitoring and arts-based approaches to ‘measure’ soil care taking place, in place, and contextualise this with our own author positionality. We discuss this suite of experimental, reflexive, affective and responsive ways to measure soil care that are contingent on that being cared about, for, with and by, and which reciprocally give care. © 2024 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.;;;

While the enormous industry of climate change science leaves plenty of room for pursuing a wide array of projects, there remain pertinent questions about identifying the most promising potential disruptive innovations with regards to climate change. To make things more complicated, the context of application is usually several degrees of separation away from where most climate change science gets pursued. This disconnect between research and action makes the problem of identifying research priorities especially challenging in this context. The purpose of this chapter is to make progress on this topic by interpreting the funding situations behind two case studies on disruptive innovations on climate change. First, the chapter considers holistic management or a series of techniques for rotating livestock which arguably has the potential to create more effective carbon sinks. Second, it considers some of the projects funded by the Paul K. Feyerabend Foundation related to environmental understanding and action. Finally, the chapter considers the various ways in which funding agencies have been successful or hampered in supporting important disruptive innovations, showing how this can relate to institutional demarcation criteria about what counts as 'science.' © 2026 Donald S.

This is an uncertainty that can be either generative or debilitating, and it is difficult to predict which in advance. Thus, apertures and opportunities can appear beyond the consideration of eligibility or preparedness, and there can be a refusal of the terms on offer. In this way, the intersections of bodies, materials, built environments and political structures can generate unanticipated opportunities amid what otherwise seem to be innumerable foreclosures. © 2025 The Author(s).

]";;;;"Ecuador; Anthropocene; coastal fishery; concealment behavior; environmental history; Eocene; ethnography; fish";Along the south-central coast of Ecuador, the shifting seascape and broader economic processes bind inhabitants with the unique sociomaterial qualities of fish and their commodified products, such as fishmeal. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this article argues that the vitality contained within fish eggs is not located within the fish itself but rather within the relationship between fish bodies and the specific human knowledges that coproduce the subjective life of fish and its commodified forms. By examining the concealment of fish from industrial boats to fishers’ households as a form of “marginal gain,” this work connects hope and anxiety with fishers’ notions of decline and indeterminacy. Fishers’ reappropriation of fish forms a critique of fishmeal economies through shifting environmental histories of the sea that are sensed through nonhuman bodies and experienced simultaneously as beneficial and detrimental. Rather than viewing these human and nonhuman configurations as another example of human hubris in the Anthropocene, this article proposes that such relations are better understood within the Wasteocene, a logic that exposes the ways that human and nonhuman bodies are rendered physically and conceptually wasted through fishers and corporate instances of caring and killing. © 2025 Michael A.

]";;;;"Czech Republic; food market; food provisioning; food quality; home garden; modernity; seasonality; urban agriculture";This paper combines two fast-developing perspectives on food provision: diverse economies and temporality. Building on an in-depth study of urban gardening in Czechia, we show that non-market economies play a central role in household food practices and that their specific temporality shapes how other parts of a household's diverse food economy are mobilised at certain times and for certain purposes. Following the diverse economies approach of reading for difference and not dominance, this paper investigates the interrelations and hierarchies among market, alternative market, and non-market food economies on the household level. We decentre the presumed dominance of market-based provisioning by showing that gardeners’ food behaviours are crucially shaped by their engagement with food self-provisioning (FSP), which creates particular understandings of food quality. What is more, the cyclical, natural time of gardening seasons determines the social rhythm of food provisioning in a contemporary urban context. This provides a counter-narrative to the dominant account about the dislodging of cyclical time embedded in natural processes by modern, accelerated time, with the former carrying a lower value than the latter. Finally, we engage with temporality on a discursive level as we counterpose our case of traditional FSP against the fascination with novelty permeating much of the search for alternative foodways. With this, we contribute to the debate on the temporality underpinning the ideas of capitalist modernity as well as post-capitalist prefiguration. © 2025 The Authors;;;Sim

]";;;;;In this empirical study we examine the characteristics of energy systems change for Rwanda envisioned by actors seeking to drive transitions who are based both within and outside the country. We rely on empirical data from interviews (N = 62) and observations. We focus on electricity and cooking services as domains which actors including the Rwandan government are seeking to transform. Our study proposes two sociotechnical imaginaries of change. The first envisions rapid, large-scale and private sector-led adoption of externally developed technologies and priorities, aligning with global sustainability agendas. The second envisions a more gradual pathway co-produced by local actors. The first imaginary's dominance has material implications. It frames Rwanda as a recipient of technology from transnational actors, who co-produce the imaginary along with the government. From a critical standpoint, the first imaginary assigns a passive role to users and rural actors while prioritizing transnational actors in urban areas, reproducing coloniality. The second imaginary similarly adheres to modernist ideals of technoscientific advance and economic catch up. Nonetheless, making room for the second imaginary and actors who challenge the first imaginary may avoid transitions in Rwanda inevitably favouring externally developed technologies and knowledges. Promisingly, certain alternative perspectives imagine transitions with characteristics which disturb the coloniality and adherence to modernity perceptible in the two imaginaries. We invite transnational actors to reflect over their participation in the stabilisation and destabilisation of place-specific energy systems change imaginaries. From a policy perspective, we highlight tensions between ambitions to implement rapid energy transformations and to innovate technologies domestically. © 2024;;;Sim

It brings together 19 short theoretical and experiential contributions, organised into six loose groups which explore areas and perspectives including Indigenous and local knowledge, technology, and children and young people as citizen researchers. It suggests that this collective approach is appropriate because both postdigital and citizen research are founded on and committed to collaboration, dialogue, and co-creation, as well as challenging the tenets and approaches of traditional academic research. In particular, it suggests that postdigital transformations in contemporary societies are both changing citizen science and humanities and making it more important. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

To date, there has been little research on how leaders in science education navigate the political environments of schooling to engage in equity work in their local contexts. The current political divisions within and among states regarding teaching about racial equity provide an important and timely context for such study. This study examines equity projects that science education leaders engage in and how these relate to recently passed legislation in several states regarding teaching about race and its ongoing role in shaping American society and institutions. It relies on survey data from science education leaders in 33 states, focusing on their familiarity with and involvement in different kinds of equity projects in science education, along with their perceptions of what supports and what hinders their equity-focused work. Employing a mixed methods approach, including descriptive analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, and thematic analysis, we found that engagement in equity projects varied widely across and within states. However, in states with laws promoting equity, leaders were engaged in more racial equity-related projects than in states with legislation that restrict discussion of matters of race, so-called “gag orders”. These findings underscore the significance of the broader political environments in shaping science education leadership and present opportunities for researchers in the field to support leaders in navigating them. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.;;;

]";;;;;Around the world, practitioners and academics are engaging in the rise of regenerative farming. On the margins of the predominant farming system, and often with little support and acknowledgement, regenerative farming is surprisingly persistent and represents a radical response to industrialization, ecological crises and alienation. This study uses feminist theories to grasp farmers’ regenerative experiences and explores how dialogical methodologies can create collective thinking among farmers and between academia and practice. The study is based on dialogues and iterative writing between three female researchers and two female regenerative farmers in Denmark in which we explore regenerative farming practices, female perspectives, feminist (more-than-human) care, and the sustainability crises we are facing today and in the future. The exchange of thoughts provides insights into what it is to be human in farming, including more-than-human relationships, as well as reflections on composting as a reproductive practice, and the (quiet) revolutionary potential of regenerative farming. Thus, we experience how creating collective thinking about common concerns across academia and practice can entail feelings of being part of a community as well as involve actual consequences and risks. Finally, it reminds us that sharing fragility by laying bare our work (and thoughts) as both researchers and practitioners allows for careful dialogues and valuable insights. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;;Marine scientists have reported drastic environmental changes in marine and polar regions as a result of climate change. The changes range from species compositions in coastal regions and the deep-sea floor, the degradation of water and ice quality to the ever-growing plastic pollution affecting marine habitats. Marine scientists study these changes in their fieldwork, and communicate their findings in scientific publications. Some also rally in protests for the necessity of political programs to tackle changes. Based on ethnographic visits and interviews with marine scientists, this study examines how marine scientists experience and act on environmental changes as individuals and as collectives. In order to analyze their experiences and actions, I use the notion of care and portray care in different times and spaces, from work to protest. I demonstrate how care needs to be situated in different times and spaces, how care is embedded in a complex relationship of institutional requirements and structural demands that researchers experience, but also how care receives institutionalization and has an impact on research interests and agendas. In doing so, I show the social and epistemic consequences of care, opening up a view of individual and collective care in the marine sciences. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;;In global environmental governance, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often involve turning pollution rights into commodities, essentially privatizing the air. Policies like carbon pricing and market approaches are considered effective solutions, especially within capitalist systems, and continue to rely on logics of the tragedy of the (atmospheric) commons. In China, the Communist Party proposed environmental policies aligning with capitalist development principles under the concept of ‘ecological civilization’. However, the perspectives on the ground differ from the government’s plans. Citizens, including sci-fi enthusiasts and eco-utopian thinkers in both rural and urban areas, have their own visions for a shared future that go beyond the narrow focus on economic growth, markets and pricing. Contrary to official narratives, interviews, social media discussions and popular artworks reveal that many envision the future ‘ecological civilization’ with clean air as commons for the more-than-human world. I argue that anthropological perspectives must attend to such creative spaces in which political subjects become enfolded in the commons, without eclipsing their potential to reinforce class divisions and social inequalities in environmental aspirations. © The Author(s) 2025.;;;Sim

But: How can technology assessment (TA) support a careful handling of plastic waste in the sea? And what can care concepts contribute to the practice of TA in this context? In this article, I show that care concepts can help understand the complexity of waste management as well as the environments involved, regulation processes, and technical innovations. Moreover, care concepts could benefit TA practice by sensitizing it not only to cultural, regional, and global concerns, but also to the distribution of responsibility and marginalization processes. © 2025, Oekom - Gesellschaft fuer Oekologische Kommunikation mbH.

Existing democratic systems struggle to address the pressing time frames required for effective climate action. This article explores a fundamental shift in temporal orientation caused by climate change. Democracy’s linear and progressive image of time clashes with the expanding scales of temporality, encompassing both planetary and microscopic processes. More specifically, the article examines the theoretical links between democracy, climate change, and time in the Anthropocene through empirical engagements with the climate politics associated with deliberative assemblies, community organizing, and activist movements. The core argument is that within these democratic innovations, new future-oriented responses to the crises are beginning to emerge. These innovations experiment with extending democracy’s temporal image beyond its conventional boundaries, paving the way for a multi-trajectory democratic politics. The article concludes by discussing the tensions and potential consequences of these democratic practices, ultimately arguing in favor of a multiple and layered understanding of democratic time that extends beyond distinctly human temporalities. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;

The paper examines children and young people's perceptions of and engagement with trees, as part of a large grant that sought to examine the dis/benefits of trees for children's lives and learning. In this paper, we attempt to move beyond notions of ‘education for sustainability’ in that we start with knowledges generated with trees. We are concerned that current educational discourses tend to incorporate extractivist perspectives. They also focus on humans rather than the inseparability of the natural world from the human experience as a starting point for research. The paper is based on a large-scale, transdisciplinary, UK-based project, rooted in in-depth, co-produced research with a total of 545 children and young people, across multiple primary and secondary schools in England and Scotland. The paper begins and exemplifies a new conversation about what starting with trees might enable for studies of education and childhood. We propose the concepts of dwelling, skilling and belonging as a novel framework for ‘starting with trees’. © 2024 The Author(s).

Mother-Led-Science-Rethinking-Science;Mother-Led Science: Rethinking Science-Based Social Movements Through Temporality and Care;"Smith, Geneva M.; Smith, Lindsay A.";2025;Science Technology and Human Values;https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439241289627;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;This article explores the subjective and temporal modes of organizing underlying science-based social movements through an analysis of two mother-led movements in Argentina. The Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo appropriated forensic anthropology and nascent DNA technologies to identify their disappeared grandchildren during the 1976–83 dictatorship. The Madres de Ituzaingó Anexo developed community-led epidemiology studies and agrochemical contamination mapping to argue for a causal relation between intensive pesticide use and high rates of childhood illnesses. We focus on how these movements delineate visions of time, responsibility, and collective action by closely examining the underlying histories and practices of each social movement as they politicized motherhood and appropriated scientific practice. We offer the concept of mother-led science through the temporal registers of constancy, desgaste, and durability to illuminate the iterative relationship between care work, creating sustainable communities and institutions, and the fragile processes of stabilizing facts. Mother-led science, with its dual claims to scientific authority in an epistemic register and maternal authority in an affective register, articulates a potent form of scientific organizing. We suggest that these affective temporalities may be present across all science-based social movements but can be obscured by narratives of linear progress toward objective truths. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;

It argues that sociology should take an interest in houseplants because studying human-plant relations in the domestic sphere offers novel possibilities for exploring wider sociological themes such as multispecies interactions, intimacy and identity as well as time and everyday life. The article analyses houseplant care practices and their significance for (re)shaping everyday rhythms and routines during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we discuss plant care as re-making time in lockdown during which new rhythms emerge and plants themselves become temporal devices which structure everyday life. Second, we discuss how affective human–houseplant bonds resulting from routine care-practices lead to a new feeling for time that materialised as an intensification of the present. In the final part, we position our empirical data within the broader literature on the transformative potential of everyday life. This leads us to explore plant care as the making of new habits and routines that can reshape our understanding of the present and future. Overall, this article shows how the practices of domestic plant care in lockdown including recognition of the temporalities and rhythms of the plants themselves reshaped the experience of time of our respondents. © The Author(s) 2025.;;;Sim

]";;;;;Humans have been accelerating biodiversity loss through spatial changes in land and sea use. Pursuing resource accumulation and exploitation, nation-states have relied on human-centric policy and development. Professionals shaping the built environment—architects, landscape architects, engineers, and urban planners—are uniquely positioned to help humans envision coinhabiting with the more-than-human world. This essay argues that fostering multispecies empathy—the cognitive and emotional capacity to feel as other beings—is essential for this vision. Drawing on Dr. Petra Tschakert’s heuristic framework for ‘encountering the Unknown Other’, Indigenous scholarship, landscape architecture, and other fields, this essay contends that humans must perceive themselves as extensions of their more-than-human counterparts to empathise with other beings. Using this conceptual orientation, designers can foster multispecies empathy through representation tactics, such as relational space-time, more-than-human agency, and co-labour = co-flourishing. © 2025 The Author(s).

As a result, soils and subsoils have been the subject of recent interest in science and technology studies (STS). This chapter begins by discussing the relationships between the critique of soil and subsoil sciences and (post)colonial issues. It presents works that have analyzed the transformation of soils and subsoils into resources. The chapter discusses the questions raised by the use of soils and subsoils in times of transition. Echoing Latour's invitation to develop a policy of the “terrestrial”, soils and subsoils open up stimulating avenues of research for STS, consisting of exploring the making of the territory, in all its material, epistemic, economic and social thickness, as well as attachments to it. © ISTE Ltd 2025.;;;

Relationships and dimensions of interdependence and distribution of power are addressed. Noting an increasing interest for caring relations in society and the agency of multiple actors, for public contexts such as landscape management and workplaces, I suggest that rural geographers pay attention to the opportunity to “spatialize” care theory development and inform rural policy formulation. Rural geography holds the potential to highlight spatial factors that invite to caring or uncaring and thereby influence rural living conditions in a broad sense. © The Author(s) 2025.

As a response to discussions of ‘land grabbing’, we introduce the concept of land ‘grasping’–attempting to secure land amid increasing precarity–to highlight the emotional dimensions of land politics. This study reveals how grasping for landresults in significant costs, including debt and exposure to violence. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;;;

The Corporate Seed Regime has displaced long-standing local seed systems, prioritizing individual ownership over commons, peasant rights, and indigenous ontologies. Drawing on Victor Turner’s concept of liminality, we examine this space as one of critique, and with potential of reform and new sociopolitical system. Through desk research and fieldwork in the UK and Colombia, we compare resistance tactics of local seed organizations. Our findings highlight a growing global movement, led by the Global South, that promotes alternative seed discourses and everyday sharing practices, now influencing the Global North. This movement underscores the polarization between informal, community-driven seed exchange and formalized legal systems, illustrating ongoing struggles for seed sovereignty and posthuman legal recognition. © 2025, Polska Akademia Nauk.

]";;;;;In Salento, since the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa outbreak in 2013, the frictions between temporalities of care and technoscience exposed the issues of the governmental state of emergency imposed since 2013. The disaster – a hecatomb of millions of olive trees – set its own temporality, dictated by the rhythm of the bacteria spreading through the environment. Drawing from ecological reparations in Salento’s aftermath, and from co-evolutionary practices in Sicilian biodiversity, I will outline the features of the temporal experience and rhythms of an ecosystem, particularly those that can no longer be governed. These ethnographic insights contextualize and inquire into Mastery of the non-Mastery, a political and ethical stance colliding nature and culture: for Michael Taussig, MNM is the way to tackle climate change (2020). Wild and feral biologies in the ecosystem oppose the rationality of modern agriculture, while marginalized human-beings, forgotten plants or animals, and discarded lands stand out as assemblages, despite the pervasivity of market-economy and extractivism. If care, ecological reparation and coevolution retrace, just like MNM does, methods of production and reproduction of human/nature relationship outside the extractivist perspective, I question the role of technoscience to help build temporalities of care and ecological repair rather than human frames of mastery over nature. © The Author(s) 2025.;;;Sim

Care—as label, concept or set of practices—is complex, multifaceted, and plays a major role in determining how landscapes look and function across social, aesthetic, material, ecological, and political domains. Synthesising recent cross-disciplinary scholarship of care, I build a conceptual framework for the care of landscapes and apply that framework through a case study of land-fire stewardship and conservation efforts in Yosemite National Park, California, where I have conducted extensive fieldwork, interviews, and archival research.

The Rabari-camel pastoralist communities traverse the arid lands of Western India to ensure the health of the camels, the vitality of the environment and the economic and social sustenance of the Rabari. It shows the ways that mobility is co-constituted, embodied and enacted as an inextricable relationship between the pastoralists, the animals and the environment. Through the practice of multi-species - mobility the conceptual and sensually experienced landscapes merge into the ‘milieu’. It shows how the dynamic, sensory and material Rabari ‘milieu’ is threatened by mainstream spatial politics, and sedentist, dualist imaginaries. Finally, it examines how reciprocity and care is leveraged as a adaptation and survival mechanism under growing pressures. © 2025 Landscape Research Group Ltd.;;;

Each avenue highlights a foundational approach and demonstrates how it is applied to specific objects and case studies. The first avenue, likely the earliest lens through which STS approached environmental issues, stems from the centrality of materiality, particularly as influenced by feminist studies and the various propositions that emerged from them. The second avenue introduces another significant STS approach, which is the denaturalization of the global environment. The third avenue stems from the body of work devoted to environmental justice, and it shifts the focus downward, toward collective mobilizations in response to the social, racial and epistemic inequalities that shape our societies. The chapter briefly highlights the questions raised by environmental STS within the broader context of debates on the Anthropocene. © ISTE Ltd 2025.;;;
Back-to-nature-or-full-throttle;‘Back to nature’ or ‘full throttle with science and technology’ for sustainable agriculture?;Straatsma, Gerben;2025;Plant and Soil;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-025-07423-5;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;Introduction: The transformation of agriculture is essential to addressing global sustainability challenges. Any transformation first requires a perspective. Our view of agriculture is linked to our view of naturalness, artificiality, and unnaturalness. A contrast exists between those who prioritize naturalness as a guiding principle and those who advocate for science and technology. This study examines the philosophical and psychological foundations of these perspectives to help scientifically trained readers navigate the public discourse on sustainable agriculture. Naturalness: The emphasis on naturalness has several roots. Naturalness is associated with purity, authenticity, and moral virtue, shaping preferences in agriculture, environmental policies, and medicine. Philosophical and psychological work suggests the role of intuitive reasoning in shaping these constructs, which can contribute to cognitive biases that influence perceptions of sustainability. Science and Technology: A science-driven approach to sustainability emphasizes rational analysis, technological innovation, and evidence-based decision-making. The scientific community often underestimates how normative values and biases shape public acceptance of technological solutions, which may be perceived as unnatural. Two Cases: The contrast between naturalness and unnaturalness is illustrated through the approaches of organic agriculture and sustainable intensification. Organic agriculture is rooted in commitments to naturalness, but faces challenges such as lower yields. Sustainable intensification emphasizes science and artificial, technological solutions but encounters scepticism in shaping agriculture. Final remark: Bridging a philosophical and psychological contrast is essential for formulating a comprehensive sustainability strategy. An inclusive discourse, informed by awareness of perspectives, can help reconcile competing visions for the future of agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.;;;

This study examines gendered differences in public service perceptions in Chile, focusing on quality, equality of treatment, and corruption in education, health, and law enforcement. Using data from the Index of Perceptions of Governance Quality at the Regional Level, we investigate whether women perceive public services more negatively than men and whether explanatory factors differ by gender. Employing linear, multilevel, and seemingly unrelated regression models, we analyze individual-level and municipal-level variables. Women report greater perceptions of inequality and corruption in health and law enforcement, with indigenous women expressing the most negative views. Female municipal leadership is associated with lower perceived corruption among women. These findings contribute to public administration scholarship by integrating care theory, representative bureaucracy, and policy feedback to inform gender-sensitive approaches to public service reform. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;;;

Nature-care-and-reproductivity;Nature, care, and (re)productivity: feminist perspectives on sustainability and the bioeconomy;"Hackfort, Sarah; Saave, Anna; Wichterich, Christa";2025;Sustainability: Science, Practice, and Policy;https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2025.2532218;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;This special issue addresses the bioeconomy, currently one of the most prominent concepts for transitioning toward sustainable economies. In the face of the rapidly accelerating climate crisis, the notion of the bioeconomy seems to offer an elegant solution for “greening” the economy while simultaneously maintaining economic growth and high productivity. Considering the existing feminist research on society-nature relations and the bioeconomy more specifically, it becomes clear that many bioeconomy policies fail to consider logics of care and lack a consistent focus on social justice and the preservation, promotion, and interaction of human and non-human reproductive capacities. Feminist research also provides a foundation for problematizing narratives of ecological modernization and green productivism. It highlights the need for a critique of sustainability narratives, which tend to gloss over the challenges of the bioeconomy rather than address them. This special issue considers this need, bringing together and into dialogue different feminist approaches and key concepts from feminist political ecology, ecofeminism, and feminist science and technology studies to critically analyze bioeconomy-related transformation processes. It also aligns with critical literature on society-nature relations in challenging the prevailing techno-optimism of bioeconomy policies and projects, which risk not just remaining oblivious to social and economic power asymmetries and (re)productivity but even opposing the latter. Focusing on the core concepts of care and (re)productivity contributes to the analysis of the (re)productive dimension of the bioeconomy as counterpart and in contrast to its inherent green productivism. © 2025 The Author(s).

]";;;;;Relevant research in a longer-term perspective is not result of a one-point intervention and re-direction of research to address social-environmental problems. Rather, for a research field to stay relevant to social-environmental issues, researchers and their communities need to continually engage in what we conceptualise as orientation work. Contrary to the notion of an invisible hand governing science in self-organised ways, the notion of orientation work offers a novel conceptual perspective on changes in research direction in the sense of caring for relevance, defined as open-ended, responsive, and collective process. Orientation work requires certain conditions of possibility and attention to value-based questions. The case of soil carbon research illustrates how orientation work can prevent research fields from getting stuck on paths that have (partly) lost their relevance. Slowly emerging in the 2000s, promises that carbon sequestration in soils could make substantial contributions to mitigate the climate crisis have generated much attention and, consequently, research funding and institutional support. Particularly with regard to responding to the climate crisis however, researchers have started to question the strong prioritisation of studying soil carbon within their research field, calling for reflections on its social-environmental relevance. Debates within soil carbon research provide evidence how orientation work on the level of research communities (besides other levels of research governance) can play an important role in addressing social-environmental problems. © 2025 The Author(s).

Productive labour and the 8-h working model contribute to this contradiction. We argue for the reduction of productive labour in favour of reproductive labour accumulated through practices of collective care. The latter can heal the damage capital accumulation produces. Collective care brings into light various social practices often invisible to production, allows for a new understanding of nonhuman agency, and challenges the dominant ethical disposition around work. We advocate for a new power equilibrium between productive and reproductive labour. © The Author(s) 2025.;;;

This study investigates the role of agroecology as a pathway of transformation of small-scale agriculture in the Colombian Andes. Drawing upon the “three spheres” model of transformation, which encompasses interactions between the personal, practical, and political spheres, the study explores motivations, actions, and political implications associated with the adoption of agroecology in three sites within the Bogotá region. The study employs a qualitative methodology, including in-depth farmer interviews and participant observation. Study findings highlight a range of economic, cultural, and ecological motivations within the personal sphere, all of which are driving farmers toward adoption of agroecology. These motivations, many of which are rooted in an ethics of care and connection, manifest in the practical sphere through actions including soil care, plant care, and care of seeds. Within the political sphere, these actions are contributing to micropolitical changes that are fostering broader shifts toward sustainable local food systems. Taken together, these findings suggest that agroecological practices can offer a viable pathway for addressing the current challenges in agriculture, promising a more sustainable and socially just future for small-scale farming. © Copyright © 2024 by the American Geographical Society of New York.;;;
A-troubling-view-of-food;A troubling view of food: tensions across matters of fact, concern, and care through the case of raw milk;Michael, Carolan;2025;Agriculture and Human Values;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-025-10766-5;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;This paper explores the relationships, tensions, and contradictions inherent in the phrase “food is political.” The concepts of “matters of fact,” “matters of concern,” and “matters of care” play critical roles in the argument. Arguing that agrifood debates arise from diverse relationalities that sit in tensions according to their “style” of fact and concerns, a thought experiment is conducted, proposing a figure and four archetypes. While the exercise may seem contrived, its value lies in surfacing the various ways these matters—of fact, concern, and care, respectively—interrelate, often in tension. To convey this value and further illuminate each archetype, the conceptual framework is employed to unpack the raw milk debate, which has recently gained national (US) attention. The paper concludes by suggesting the abandonment of the view that agrifood systems must be “fixed,” proposing recommendations that embrace ambiguity and tension. We must stay with the trouble, representing a significant departure from agrifood imaginaries that continue to present phenomena such as food, health, disease, and nutrition in black-and-white (e.g., good/bad, safe/unsafe) terms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.;;;

In more-than-human design, care is a practice that allows a deep engagement with time and temporality. Existing terms such as caring for and about fall short in accounting for this engagement by not bringing to the fore the diverse temporal frames embedded in care relations and the fluidity of agency between caregiver and receiver roles. This paper provides a typology informed by different kinds of care based on engagement with time and labor, such as caring for, about, and through. Specifically, we contribute caring through as a concept emphasizing the role of more-than-human temporality in care practice. Caring through accounts for plural engagements with time, the interdependence between caregiver and care receiver, and mediated aspects of care where care becomes making time for the other. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;;;Sim

]";;;;"biodiversity; climate change; food production; shape; soil conservation; soil degradation; soil science";Given the urgency of the global soil degradation crisis, soil scientists must communicate the importance of soil as being part of nature and the critical need for conserving soil biodiversity. Drawing on a thematic analysis of editorials related to soil conservation and management, we analyzed common themes, key messages, and frames that authors used to advocate for change. Soil biodiversity was referred to in 8 of the 11 editorials, but it was less emphasized and discussed in less detail than messages centered around food production, water resources, and climate change. Editorials structured arguments around economic development, scientific and technical uncertainty, and morality and ethics. We believe future editorials should apply other persuasive frames including social progress, public accountability, and working-towards-compromise when advocating for soil biodiversity conservation. Soil ecologists can improve communications about soil biodiversity by (1) identifying an audience and selecting relevant key messages, (2) strategically applying a persuasive frame, and (3) amplifying diverse voices with a consistent message. We provide a guide for developing essays that encourages soil ecologists to shape discourse, advance policy priorities, and enable non-soil ecologists to communicate about soil biodiversity conservation. © 2024 The Authors;;;Sim

]";;;;;Biodiversity shortfalls and taxonomic bias can lead to inaccurate assessment of conservation priorities. Previous literature has begun to explore practical reasons why some species are discovered sooner or are better researched than others. However, the deeper socio-cultural causes for undiscovered and neglected biodiversity, and the value of collectively analysing species at risk of unrecorded, or “dark”, extinction, are yet to be fully examined. Here, we argue that a new label (we propose “shadow diversity”) is needed to shift our perspective from biodiversity shortfalls to living, albeit unknown, species. We suggest this linguistic shift imparts intrinsic value to these species, beyond scientific gaze and cultural systems. We review research on undiscovered, undetected and hidden biodiversity in the fields of conservation biology, macroecology and genetics. Drawing on philosophy, geography, history and sociology, we demonstrate that a range of socio-cultural factors (funding, education and historical bias) combine with traditional, practical impediments to limit species discovery and detection. We propose using a spectrum of shadow diversity which enables a complex, non-binary and comprehensive approach to biodiversity unknowns. Shadow diversity holds exciting potential as a tool to increase awareness, appreciation and support for the conservation of traditionally less studied wildlife species and sites, from soil microbes to less charismatic habitat fragments. We advocate for a shift in how the conservation community and wider public see biodiversity and an increase in popular support for conserving a wider range of life forms. Most importantly, shadow diversity provides appropriate language and conceptual frameworks to discuss species absent from conservation assessment and at potential risk of dark extinction. © The Author(s), 2024.

With this attention has come increased policy support as well as the launch of private sector programs that promote regenerative agriculture as a form of carbon farming. In the United States many of these programs recruit primarily in regions where large-scale commodity production prevails, such as the Great Plains. There, a decades-old regenerative agriculture movement is growing rapidly, but not due to the incentives offered by companies’ carbon programs. On the contrary, farmers are adopting regenerative practices to cut their dependence on corporate agrochemical inputs and expertise, and to thereby achieve technology sovereignty. These practice changes often strain farmers’ existing social relationships while drawing them into new and previously neglected ones, including the more-than-human relations necessary for building soil health. These new relationships and the knowledge they generate may in turn lead farmers to think differently about their own autonomy.

By analysing a selection of ten media artworks, all in different ways concerned with time and temporality, we explore how artists approach these matters as culturally and politically loaded. The selected projects align with the ongoing scholarly interest in alternatives to common perceptions on time, unmaking the normative clock time and the posthuman discourse. Following an analysis of the theoretical and material expressions of these artworks, we conceptualised four themes through which unmaking was represented: dissecting temporality, the unmaking of the singular, unmaking as messing up and unmaking the other. We close with a discussion on how these themes intersect with the current discourse on unmaking in HCI and reflect on challenges and opportunities for design and theory. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;;;Sim

Predatory Data illuminates the throughline between the nineteenth century's anti-immigration and eugenics movements and our sprawling systems of techno-surveillance and algorithmic discrimination. With this book, Anita Say Chan offers a historical, globally multisited analysis of the relations of dispossession, misrecognition, and segregation expanded by dominant knowledge institutions in the Age of Big Data. While technological advancement has a tendency to feel inevitable, it always has a history, including efforts to chart a path for alternative futures and the important parallel story of defiant refusal and liberatory activism. Chan explores how more than a century ago, feminist, immigrant, and other minoritized actors refused dominant institutional research norms and worked to develop alternative data practices whose methods and traditions continue to reverberate through global justice-based data initiatives today. Looking to the past to shape our future, this book charts a path for an alternative historical consciousness grounded in the pursuit of global justice.

]";;;;"Element compositions; Literals; Performance; Performance study";Performing Climates features 14 interconnected chapters exploring theatre and performance’s relationship with more-than-human elements at a time of climate emergency. The book argues that Western performance – how we conceive of it, as well as how we train and educate people in and about it – needs to reorient its ways of making and thinking about itself to reconsider patterns of breakdown, decay and renewal happening on and off stage in a literal play of cells and particles. Performing Climates examines live performance as a uniquely compostable artform, formed by sonic vibrations and movements of air and matter, more-than-human elements, composition and decomposition. This book will appeal to undergraduate audiences, postgraduate scholars and performance studies colleagues, offering exciting possibilities for reconsidering theatre and performing in an age of crisis. © 2025 Eddie Paterson and Lara Stevens.;;;Sim

First, it unpacks, drawing on original empirical data, how these impacts make salient the interconnectedness of human and more-than-human worlds, which it explores with reference to the concept of solastalgia. Second, the article situates its analysis of the war's environmental impacts directly in relation to transitional justice. Calling for a relational reframing of the field that gives expression to multiply entangled lifeworlds, it reflects on what this reframing might look like and emphasises two key ideas - care and listening. © 2025 The Author(s).

Given that design may contribute to our worsening socio-ecological conditions, this is seen as a pivotal moment to question and expand Participatory Design’s traditional tenets, such as those grounded in democracy, rights, fairness, inclusion and empowerment, to consider what a different philosophical starting point and commitment to more-than-human Participatory Design might bring. This chapter explores the different traditions underpinning existing Participatory Design work oriented towards sustainability. We show the beginnings of a Participatory Design drawn from an appreciation of the innately interdependent and entangled nature of the world, called here the more-than-human. Two lineages of Participatory Design scholarship are traced: Sustainability (with branches in Modernist and rights-based thinking) and Entanglement (with branches in care-based and co-ontological being). The chapter presents three cases to ground our explorations and bring to light how human-nature separations in systems, structures, values and mindsets inadvertently condition our practice. Our cases ground the theories and paradigms identified in the four branches and show how commitments play out and evolve through practice. This allows us to critically examine existing tenets of Participatory Design and reinterpret the visions that these hold to explore what more-than-human relationality might entail. Our discussion reveals the tensions, politics, paradoxes and difficulties in turning towards more-than-human relationalities and in working across and between worldviews. The chapter closes with the questions that the ambitions of more-than-human Participatory Design pose for our practice. At best, we hope they present a means to tread more gently and responsibly on the earth we share. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Rachel Charlotte Smith, Daria Loi, Heike Winschiers-Theophihis, Liesbeth Huybrechts and Jesper Simonsen.;;;

]";;;;;Microbes are increasingly central to visions of sustainable and healthy futures, including in farming movements such as regenerative agriculture. In social science and environmental humanities scholarship, (re)connecting with microbes is seen as a way to challenge, conceptually and practically, the very ontology of human-nature separation which underpins the destruction and violence in human relations with other living beings and with environments. The crux of this onto-ethical potential is a shift towards relational modes of knowing microbes, rooted in localised, proximate, and sensuous practice, and expressed in embodied expertise. This paper engages critically with this promise by calling attention to persistence of calculability to people's self-governance within current microbiopolitics. Through a case study of regenerative agriculture in the United Kingdom, I argue that while embodied expertise of soil microbes is seen as crucial to soil health-oriented farming, it is also dismissed as an insufficient in guiding farmers and shaping future practice, including by farmers themselves. Regenerative agriculture continues to function within “farming by numbers”, an agri-biopolitical regime in which farmers’ and advisors’ subjectivity is that of calculating managers situated in calculable environments. As a result, calculability acts as a ‘break’ on the development of alternative microbial onto-ethics, and regenerative agriculture practitioners look for ways to bring soil microbes into the realm of calculability (e.g., through metagenomics). Consequently, the way microbes are being incorporated into future agri-environmental relations reinforces rather than threatens existing structures of biopolitical power. Overall, I argue that human-microbe research, potentially due to its empirical focus on alternative practices, has underplayed the importance of calculability to people's self-governance in relations with microbes. The struggle for a new microbiopolitics, especially in agriculture and environmental management, will require addressing the continued importance of calculability, and a creative and socially relevant experimentation with alternative forms of expertise. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;"carbon sequestration; climate change; combustion; environmental justice; fossil fuel; perturbation; soil carbon";There is growing interest in enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) as a climate mitigation strategy, including neutralizing atmospheric emissions from fossil-fuel combustion through the development of soil carbon offset markets. Several studies have focused on refining estimates of the magnitude of potential SCS or on developing methods for soil carbon quantification in markets. We call on scientists and policy makers to resist assimilating soils into carbon offset markets due to not only fundamental flaws in the logic of these markets to reach climate neutrality but also environmental justice concerns. Here, we first highlight how carbon offset markets rely on an inappropriate substitution of inert fossil carbon with dynamic stocks of soil carbon. We then note the failure of these markets to account for intersecting anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle, including the soil carbon debt and ongoing agricultural emissions. Next, we invite scientists to consider soil functions beyond productivity and profitability. Finally, we describe and support historical opposition to offset markets by environmental justice advocates. We encourage scientists to consider how their research and communications can promote diverse soil functions and just climate-change mitigation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Urban areas need to provide a healthy environment for residents, but this is threatened by climate change. Mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change does not involve one-size-fits-all global solutions; cities face varying economic and social contexts. Cities need to offer ecosystem services in order to operate as healthy urban ecosystems. The urban soils’ environmental services are often overlooked, leading to public administrations having little to no awareness about land management policies and ecosystem services. Technosols, artificial or human altered soils, have the potential to provide the same ecosystem benefits as natural soils and do not require as much time to develop in order to perform their functions. Additionally, technosols have the potential to enhance the circular economy using waste materials. In this sense, policy makers should incorporate urban technosols as a strategy to enhance the health of cities and address climate change. Our perspective on soils in urban areas needs to be altered, as technosols should be included in urban policies, have the potential to serve as a crucial component in providing ecosystem services and acting as a carbon sink and enhance urban well-being. © 2024 by the authors.";;;Sim

]";;;;"Atacama; Chile; action plan; agricultural soil; analytical framework; soil amendment; soil degradation; soil management";Multiple studies have shown an alarming level of soil degradation in Chile, a fundamental pillar of biodiversity and food production. This recognition has led in recent decades to the implementation of soil governance programs, through which this situation can begin to be reversed. Adopting an analytical framework from the social studies of soils, this article analyzes the main public instrument generated for this purpose, the “Incentive System for the Recovery of Degraded Soils” (SIRSD-S). By following its history and implementation in the Atacama Region, the article presents SIRSD-S as framed within a productivism problematization. From this perspective, agricultural soils tend to be understood mainly as an inert infrastructure for food and fodder production, especially under a monoculture export-oriented agro-industrial model. As a result, SIRSD-S tends to give primacy to action plans focused on the introduction of singular technical amendments focused on maintaining the current productivity of soils. By neglecting any recognition of soils as part of complex socio-ecologies, these measures do not really deal with the conditions that led to the degradation of these soils. In the conclusions we are going to explore some changes that could really help SIRSD-S to achieve its original object, to reduce the degradation levels on Chilean agricultural soils. © 2024, Revista de Geografia Norte Grande.

We illustrate what children were indeed learning in the land of refuge during the pandemic, with their family, beyond narrowly defined in-school learning. We conceptualize the recentering of intergenerational ways of knowing, often overlooked in colonial institutionalized learning spaces, as transdisciplinary acts for disrupting the hegemonic disciplinary formation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.;;;

]";;;;;Ecosystem restoration initiatives present natures as intervention-requiring problems. However, not all stakeholders may be able to recognise and relate to the issues that motivate restoration. Instead, they may put forward alternative understandings of natures as problematic issues in need of management and collective action. Therefore, ecosystem restoration can turn generative into new forms of publics that are brought together – and drawn apart – by distinctive configurations of nature-issues. This paper analyses such a reorganisation by focusing on three restoration projects carried out in Finland. The projects sought to engage farmers in restoring agricultural streams while proposing the practice of stream restoration as an extensive ecosystem revitalisation. In the studied cases, farmers could become attentive to the potential of stream habitats to develop into viable and rich ecosystems, while their neighbours only showed interest in improving the drainage functions of streams. The restoration initiatives generated connectedness between farmers, streams habitats and the restoration projects, but also disconnectedness between natures and publics. The possibilities of the studied projects to carry out their restoration plans rested mostly on the specification of the restoration plans as a means to manage ontological differences. The findings indicate that instead of promoting ecosystem restoration as a tightly coupled practice, it can be useful to generate space for collective action that unfolds in terms of partially different natures and nature-issues. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

In this paper we look at the potential of locative games in fostering caring engagement with natural/cultural heritage. We present the results of a contextual study that explores the nature:culture duality of the Levada walks on Madeira Island and their intrinsic playfulness as a natural landscape. Through a combination of narrative self-reports and cultural probes, we conducted an on-site investigation of the motivations and embodied experiences of hiking these trails, distilling an empirical epistemology of human-nature interactions. By unpacking the various realities and tensions on the ground through a feminist ethics of care and posthuman lens, we provide insight into the design of future locative interactive technologies to support and encourage human-nature interaction. Our findings address and promote values of engagement and conservation in cultural and natural heritage through a nature:culture continuum. © 2024 Owner/Author.;;;Sim

It highlights the ecological challenges of intensive agriculture, drawing on theories like Haraway's cyborg metaphor and Latour's actor-network theory to contextualize the crisis within the interplay of human and non-human actors. The study introduces a conceptual blockchain-based prototype to automate ecosystem resilience through DAOs that manage land and agricultural practices. It proposes strategic interventions such as reforestation with nitrogen-fixing trees, cultivating flood-resistant crops, and the creation of new agro-settlements. The paper argues that blockchain technologies can optimize these strategies by enabling precise monitoring and management, thus enhancing soil fertility, sustainable agriculture, and community sustainability. It presents a vision of agroecosystems as resilient, autonomous entities capable of addressing ecological and economic challenges. © 2024 Owner/Author.;;;Sim

]";;;;;This paper speaks to the uneven scholarly attention gone into tracing dominant forms of water governance as opposed to practices crafting alternative human-water relations on the ground. Through the case of an Indian-based network mobilising to transform how we understand rainfed regions as rain-dependent socio-ecologies, I theorise their action ‘with care’, a commitment to think-with grassroots movements as actors capable of bringing new worlds into being. Describing their activities as worlding-practices, I explore how the network confronts the invisibilities inscribed by the current paradigm reducing water to irrigation by defining alternative metrological tools that recentre the governance of water from the perspective of the rainfall. Tinkering with the variables of the constituted metrology, the network utilises an atlas, a formula, and an acronym to enact a different rainfed sociality into being, creating visibilities and cares for neglected things. Through the story of a grassroots group and their strategies of mobilisation, this account contributes to debates on how to pluralise water governance, suggesting that reimagining its practices requires taking seriously the performativity of grassroots knowledges. Building alliances between research and activism as e/affective world-building partners becomes key to co-theorise liveable human-water relations and caring socio-ecologies at large. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;;This paper seeks to understand how caring for new-born livestock is made possible, which practices of care are privileged and to what effect? These aims are situated in attempts to promote the prudent use of antibiotics amongst livestock farmers to prevent antimicrobial resistance. In focusing on the rearing of new-born calves on dairy and beef farms in England and Wales, the paper reveals how care is configured by different temporal orders, the tensions between different temporalities of care, the reasons for them and the strategies employed by calf rearers to manage these tensions. Drawing on the concept of the ‘timescape’, the paper shows how calf care temporalities are relationally enacted and configured by materials, infrastructures and technologies. Common (productivist) agricultural temporalities of care emphasise speed, urgency and efficiency. However, by analysing the practice of feeding colostrum and ‘tubing’ – the forced feeding of calves via a tube inserted into the oesophagus – we highlight how these rapid caring temporalities conflict with the slower, patient skills of calf rearing. At the same time, however, we show how care is rendered fluid as calf rearers find ways of accommodating seemingly discordant temporalities – what we call ‘patient urgence’ – allowing different temporalities to co-exist within agricultural timescapes. Nevertheless, we show how these practices of accommodation are themselves the result of a productivist temporal order that marginalises calves and calf rearers. We argue that these timescapes point to the need for broader structural and cultural changes within agriculture to reduce the use of antibiotics. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;;This introduction outlines an approach to commons that cap-tures and responds to intersecting social, environmental, and political complications. The extractive power of states and corporations has long threatened the lives and livelihoods of the poor. However, contemporary local struggles are not adequately understood by frameworks that rest exclusively on social and political power. Climate change and the lin-gering effects of colonial and industrial extraction multiply the threats to the wider ecologies on which human lives depend. Debates on the commons have addressed such struggles, but without sufficient attention to the diverse bioethical regimes that underpin conventional com-mons. We propose that such attention can inform analyses by moving beyond the narrow singularities of modern categories. Our introduction lays the groundwork for an approach to the commons that pays attention to multiple and intersecting modes of dispossession, while also looking at convening or ‘commoning’ practices that are oriented toward building alternative relational worlds. © The Author(s).;;;Sim

The mass-digitization of specimens is urgent especially now, so museum actors and biodiversity scientists stress, as natural history collections could provide the biodiversity sciences with crucial data for research into the effects of climate-change induced biodiversity loss. This paper investigates the processes and practices through which these biodiversity data are produced. It argues that the work of data production requires the negotiation of- and grappling with different temporalities, and that attending to these temporalities contributes to a further understanding of the politics of mass-digitization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin's collection of snail shells, the paper brings into view the work required to make snail specimens and their metadata digital. Following steps in a mollusk digitization workflow—meant to streamline and scale up digitization processes—it attends to the misalignment of rhythms; the importance of informal cleaning labor; the negotiation of social, biological, and colonial temporalities in practices of label transcription; and the anticipatory and expansive logics of mass-digitization. Drawing on snails’ ability to “drift,” it raises data drift as a way of engaging with natural history collections and their data. © The Author(s) 2024.";;;Sim

The focus on soil as a resource has created increasingly exhausted landscapes. Soil science is well placed to (re)build the urgently needed connection between humans and nature by generating evidence for soil functioning and, perhaps most importantly, by establishing linkages with diverse types of soil knowledge and integrating them in collaborative solutions. Such transdisciplinary solutions can be achieved by transforming current ways of doing soil science, which begin with soil scientists. Anchored in feminist and critical thinking, we used the ‘reflecting and doing’ framework (Lopez et al., 2023) to demonstrate how reflexivity can help soil science to become a transformative space. By partially dissolving the mind–heart and human–soil dualisms, we can foster a way of generating soil knowledge that emerges from the relations within and beyond the human Self. Such an approach is relatively new in academic soil science, which relies heavily on the scientific method as a detached form of knowing that privileges mind over body, reason over emotion, culture over nature and production over reproduction. We argue that this journey starts with (re)positioning ourselves as soil scientists in relation to our research and advance a Transformative Soil Science that recognizes soil knowledge as situated and embodied and that identifies soil as the main ally for a sustainable world. © 2024 British Society of Soil Science.;;;

This societal shift has led to a decline in the appreciation of and cultural identity with soils. Amid a broader movement aimed at fostering soil awareness and environmental action, many artists and designers have been instrumental in bringing soils to the cultural mainstream, figuring their esthetic, social, political, and ecological dimensions. Contemporary artists place great importance on the underlying idea of animating soils through artistic practice, often transcending the physical artifact itself to assign agency to soils and the myriad beings that occupy them. Artists harness a multitude of media to articulate human-soil relationships. From the early environmental art movements of the 1960s and 1970s to contemporary works centered on urban and industrial brownfields, soils’ multifaceted roles in CO2 transformation, water and nutrient cycling, agriculture, and as living bodies buffering against pollution have become ground for public discourse. What could this mean for the vadose zone in terms of reflecting on material flows in porous media beyond understandings of soil physics? In this paper, we draw on over 20 years of experience in studying the portrayal of soil in various arts genres to deliberate the potential of creative thinking about and thinking with the vadose zone. © 2024 The Authors.

The ""everyday"" refers to localised practices, specific networks, and practical norms that emerge in a process of interaction, translation, and reinterpretation. The authors build this approach on assemblage thinking and theory, which focuses on the collective production of the social through complex sets of connections. For this reason, assemblage thinking becomes a particularly productive guide in exploring how everyday governance is co-produced in the interaction between numerous social processes involving a diversity of actors and instruments. The authors navigate between original and contrasting case studies from Switzerland, Indonesia, and the European Union in order to reorient attention to the transformative nature of governance, which they locate along four different dimensions of the everyday: (1) the interdependence of instruments within a wider governance assemblage; (2) the uncertainty and unpredictability of effects in agrienvironmental governance; (3) the distributed nature of agency and its implication for power relations; (4) the importance of capacities in the transformation of agri-food systems. This book calls for a redesigning of agri-environmental governance that should move away from the setting of fix and precise objectives and solutions, and rather aim for a consolidation of sound foundations on which desirable futures can emerge. The book will be an essential read for students and scholars interested in sustainable agriculture and food systems, governance modes and approaches, and sustainability more broadly. © 2025 Jérémie Forney, Dana Bentia, and Angga Dwiartama.

]";;;;"Biodiversity; Digital Technology; biodiversity; digital technology";Biodiversity is a multidimensional concept that can be understood and measured in many different ways. However, the next generation of digital technologies for biodiversity monitoring currently being funded and developed fail to engage its multidimensional and relational aspects. Based on empirical data from interviews, a conference visit, online meetings, webinars, and project reports, this study articulates four digital logics that structure how biodiversity becomes monitored and understood within recent technological developments. The four digital logics illustrate how intensified practices of capturing, connecting, simulating, and computing produce particular techno-scientific formats for creating biodiversity knowledge. While ongoing projects advance technological development in areas of automation, prediction, and the creation of large-scale species databases, their developmental processes structurally limit the future of biodiversity technology. To better address the complex challenges of the global biodiversity crisis, it is crucial to develop digital technologies and practices that can engage with a wider range of perspectives and understandings of relational and multidimensional approaches to biodiversity. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

Bodily attunements to place and space can help cultivate belongingness and heal the anxious modern body, as well as facilitate community solidarity to combat the loneliness and isolation that many are experiencing. Human systems and services have the potential to facilitate meaningful experiences for community members and to incite joyful, thoughtful, or motivating multisensory interactions. Humans’ surroundings have paramount effects on inhabitants and should offer opportunity and inspiration. This paper suggests that such inspiration be drawn from ecological knowledge that can garner healing and wellbeing and offers suggestions and recommendations for doing so. Humane designs are integrated with nature and include environmental access and information that encourages civic participation. This work uses theories and models in ecological community psychology and cultural ecology as well as anthropological approaches to human health to offer somatic principles for healthy community planning and development and for integrating such nature-based health principles into existing structures, including the built environment as well as education. Healing through nature is highlighted here as an approach for attuning to post-pandemic landscapes in order to move into the future in the most generative, sustainable, and supportive ways possible. © 2024 by the author.;;;Sim

]";;;;;In the Argentine Chaco — a world hotspot of agribusiness-driven deforestation — descendants of European settlers (gringos) who built manual cotton plantations on Indigenous land and labor in the twentieth century, have since been displaced from farming by the “soy boom.” Nevertheless, plantation legacies persist in the racialized plant-relations of these actors today, and in their conflicted — and often acquiescent — attitudes to agribusiness. Drawing on emergent theories of the “Plantationocene,” this essay examines how three settler interlocutors grieve the loss of plant-worlds that soy agribusiness has displaced, with a focus on living soil, cotton seeds, and potted roses. I show that these multispecies attachments perform a double role: while they sensitize these actors to the ecological fallouts of the soy boom, they also reinforce settler colonial plantation logics of racialized progress that ultimately feed their acquiescence to that agribusiness model. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

However, adaptation projects tend to favour technocratic, market-driven, and Eurocentric approaches that inadvertently disregard the place-based and contextual adaptation strategies of many communities in the Global South. The paper aims to decolonise climate change adaptation guided by the critical tenets of ‘Decolonising Climate Adaptation Scholarship’ (DCAS). It presents empirical case studies from Fiji, Vietnam, and the Philippines and reveals the different ways that Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) and strategies are devalued and suppressed by modernist and developmentalist approaches to climate adaptation. The paper then foregrounds some of the adaptive techniques that resist and remain, or have been re-worked in hybrid ways with ILK. Ultimately, this paper combats the delegitimisation of ILK by mainstream climate change adaptation scholarship and highlights the need for awareness and openness to other forms of knowing and being. © 2023 The Author(s);;;Sim

Our approach is informed by ideas in science and technology studies (STS) emphasising the irreducible entanglement of care practices and technology, and in particular the concept of ‘tinkering’ as a practice of adaptation. To make our analysis, we draw on qualitative interview accounts (n = 19) of service providers involved in BUP-XR implementation across five sites. Our analysis considers the disruptive novelty of BUP-XR. Tinkering to make a novel technology work in practice slows down the expectation of implementation in relation to transformative innovation, despite the promise of dramatic or rapid change. Tinkering allowed for more open relations, for new care practices that departed from the routine and familiar, opening potential for how BUP-XR could be put to use and made to work in its new situation, and as its situation evolved along-with its implementation. Flexibility and openness of altering relations was, however, at times, held in tension with inflexibility and closure. This analysis identifies a concern for what is made present and what is made absent in the altered care network affected by BUP-XR, with the multiple effects of supervised daily dosing practices thrown into relief as they become absented. Tinkering to implement BUP-XR locally connects with a broader assemblage of trial and movement in the constitution of treatment. The introduction of long-acting technologies prompts new questions about embedded implementation practices, including supervised dosing, urinalysis, the time and place of psychosocial support, and how other social aspects of care might be recalibrated in drug treatment. © 2024 The Authors;;;Sim

Cubense). Taiwan was the world's fourth-largest exporter of bananas in the 1960s before the collapse of the market in the early 1970s. While scholars have drawn on actor-network theory-inspired performativity approach to understand the role of non-human actants in market-making, insufficient attention has been given to the distinct impacts of microbes on cases such as that of Taiwan's banana export market. Microbes’ creative and ever-evolving qualities constantly present challenges related to the control and containment of such non-human entities, for which no pre-existing or universally applicable solutions exist. Consequently, there is a lack of research that provides useful frameworks to understand such disease-plagued markets. To bridge this gap in the literature, we examine the remaking of Taiwan's banana export market in the aftermath of the TR4 crisis using a case study approach and develop the notion of pathological markets. Inspired by recent scholarship on biosecurity and related care practices, we outline two characteristics that shape pathological markets: (a) speculative and probiotic care practices and (b) the rescaling of market organisations. The results of the fieldwork conducted as part of the present study in laboratories, government offices and on banana farms lead us to contend that the growth and development of particular microbes in multispecies environments such as Taiwan's banana farms constantly pose significant challenges for market farming. Moreover, to co-exist with the threats posed by the growth and development of microbes such as those which cause Fusarium wilt disease TR4, growers in Taiwan's banana export market rely heavily on probiotic and speculative care practices. © The Author(s) 2023.;;;

The concept is used to describe current institutionalized ways of relating to soils and their dynamics of power. Through an integrative literature review, the article links existing research on soils with the development of modern agriculture in Europe. The theoretical contribution of soil extractivism provides a conceptual tool for understanding currently dominant ways of treating soils as a key part of modernity and industrial capitalism as well as part of wider destructions of multispecies relations. © 2024 The Author;;;Sim

The prioritisation of economic growth by the most dominant political institutions encourages limitless expansion while minimizing awareness of the ecological vulnerability of the planet. Commoning presents an alternative political structure based on transformative practices of collective care or caring with. In this paper, we investigate how communities in Skouries of Halkidiki, Greece, are responding to the imposition of large-scale mining through three different commons initiatives. The women's collective, the chamomile commons, and the ten-day festival. These commons provide insights into how instances of caring with performed by human and nonhuman others are the foundations of local place-based politics. We argue that already existing examples of commoning and caring with can make visible a more fitting politics for the Anthropocene that can benefit decision-making at national and international levels. © 2024 The Authors;;;Sim

]";;;;;This paper concerns how digitizing biological resources enables disentangling information technologies from biological bodies and, thus, from response-abilities among creatures from which they are derived. Extracting (digital) information from (biological) bodies makes it possible to stabilize, freeze, circulate, and control that information independently from creaturely activities—multiplying, not subtracting from the originating material. Such extractions tend to attenuate human interdependencies with other creatures even while expanding the scope of their utility as resources, to the effect of limiting those who have a stake in their development to humans alone. Where conventional natural resource extraction does violence to places and those interdependent with them, digital resource extractions may instead do violence to human capacities to recognize and act on multispecies interdependencies. Here, I argue that choosing to realize connections among organisms and organismal resources makes it possible to envision how creatures may be stakeholders in their own development, with joined ethical and epistemic consequences. I trace that possibility through a case study of the essential laboratory yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae via the physical metaphor of snowflake yeast, an S. cerevisiae variant that maintains multicellular connections as it reproduces. © The Author(s) 2024.;;;Sim

]";;;;;"What is philosophically interesting about how soil is managed and categorized? This paper begins by investigating how different soil ontologies develop and change as they are used within different social communities. Analyzing empirical evidence from soil science, ethnopedology, sociology, and agricultural extension reveals that efforts to categorize soil are not limited to current scientific soil classifications but also include those based in social ontologies of soil. I examine three of these soil social ontologies: (1) local and Indigenous classifications farmers and farming communities use to conceptualize their relationships with soil in their fields; (2) categorizations ascribed to farmers in virtue of their agricultural goals and economic priorities relied upon in sociological research; and (3) federal agency classifications of land capability employed by agricultural scientists. Studying the interplay of these social ontologies shows how assessing soil properties and capabilities are the result of previous agricultural strategies informed by culture, agroecological history, weather, soil biodiversity, crop rotation, and the goals held by decision-makers. The paper then identifies the soil relationships and interactions that constitute ontology-making activities. Building on recent work, I outline a novel interactive account of perspectival realism grounded in agricultural extension research and ethnopedological data that captures the haptic nature of farmers’ soil strategies. This interactive account explains how ontologies are chosen, why they are chosen, and how they interact and inform soil management decision-making. The paper concludes by examining the values laden in these ontologies and those which are causally implicated in the choice of soil management strategies. © 2024 Author(s) published by the Journal of Social Ontology.";;;Sim

]";;;;;"This article delves into the intricate dynamics of air datafication as matters of care within the distinctive context of air quality data politics in Poland. It focuses on the implementation of data-mediated care for air quality, scrutinizing two interconnected dimensions: data practices and data phronesis. The former involves the meticulous handling of air quality data, while the latter explores the phronetic valuation of more-than-human realms, including data standards, air sensing technologies, and a diverse array of actors integral to the datafication process. Data phronesis is conceptualized as the situated and context-dependent practical wisdom demonstrated by various actors, shaping the definition of ‘good’ data-mediated care for air quality. The article emphasizes the duality of care, highlighting the interplay between data phronesis and data practices. It underscores the ongoing negotiation surrounding air quality concerns, intricately mediated through data, within relational and contextual dimensions. Through an in-depth qualitative examination and Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four key themes, related to data-mediated air quality care, are identified: ‘caring about data,’ involving the valuation of situated data practices; ‘caring for data,’ translating polluted air into reliable data, while considering dominant standards; ‘caring by data,’ defining data usage methods within dynamic contexts; and ‘data for caring,’ exploring practical applications, particularly activist practices integrating diverse local contexts with European air quality standards. The article enriches our understanding of datafication as matters for care, shedding light on the interconnections between hands-on data practices and the contextual wisdom steering strategic action. © 2024 The Author(s).

]";;;;;Starting from the premise that modern legal institutions are increasingly challenged by the temporal and spatial implications of Anthropocene phenomena, this article shows how various civil-society actors struggle for a more just approach to coal-exit policies in the Rhineland’s brown coal mining region. Contrary to general criticisms arguing that the Anthropocene narrative inherently disregards a differentiated perspective on issues of justice, I follow approaches that engage with the concept’s generative tensions and situate it ethnographically. The article goes on to suggest that growing awareness of the entanglements of industrial infrastructures with planetary crises has led to local protests against mining coinciding with an engagement for future planetary habitability. Whereas mining-induced losses were previously written off as a necessary sacrifice for growth and progress, I discuss how the affected inhabitants reframe them in this emerging context as injustices on a planetary scale. Motivated by a responsibility towards non-human others and coming generations, these coal-critical actors contest official transition measures that center on ‘green growth’ and instead call for situated policies that account for matters of concern related to accelerated planetary change. The article concludes by arguing that the pursuit of justice in the Anthropocene is fundamentally characterized by a responsibility towards absent others, spatially and temporally. © 2024 Dietrich Reimer Verlag.;;;Sim

I first outline the practices involved in keeping trails running, conceptualising the squatted spaces they occupy as ‘ruins’. Second, I draw from literature around care and commoning to argue that these spots are not neglected due to being overlooked, but that this is cultivated, and is a requirement of their subsistence. I find that in these spaces, the mundane practices of shovelling and watering, to the forms of governance and exclusion enacted, illustrate forms of repair and maintenance that are multiple and layered, and that this can lead to a ‘repair’ of the macho, hetero-normative culture that has previously pervaded in these spots. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Jim Cherrington; individual chapters, the contributors.

]";;;;;Communities and individuals have raised the alarm for decades denouncing the Chilean development model and the resulting social-environmental degradation of the country. This article addresses how small manual actions are multiplying in various regions of Chile to respond to the environmental crisis, in a context marked by the production of extractive industries (production of salmon, pine trees, eucalyptus, fruit for export, copper, lithium). This article aims to underscore the development of agroecological projects or those transitioning to agroecology in the south of Chile, in Chiloé and in the regions of Araucanía, historically Mapuche territory. Their practices contribute to promoting and transmitting ancestral knowledge and expertise related to seed-saving, family and peasant farming, co-operation and the organization of territorial defence collectives. Our work is based on a method uniting long-term investigation and patchwork ethnography, based on short but in-depth research stays. Interviews complement the data. Lastly, this work contributes to considering an ethics of care across agroecological projects led by women in the south of Chile. © 2024 University of Toronto. All rights reserved.;;;Sim
The-Creative-Arts-in-Early-Childhood-Teacher-Education;The Creative Arts in Early Childhood Teacher Education as a Site of Resistance to Neoliberalism;"Grimes, Jessica; Gordon, Paddy; Jobson, Sarah";2024;Inclusion and Social Justice in Teacher Education;https://doi.org/10.1007/9783031676123_22;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;This chapter will examine the claim that early childhood pedagogy is structured by neoliberal political and social normativity, where the processes of creative exploration are secondary to an ultimately arbitrary and pre-determined “outcome”. An “outcomes-focussed” approach to early childhood arts pedagogy is incompatible with the engagement necessary for early childhood teachers to meaningfully co-create with children. However, despite neoliberalism’s hegemony— which today is being contested by often alarming reactionary tendencies—we can find instances of play-based and process-focussed approaches that inform our early childhood education courses. Neoliberalism as a theoretical framework is inimical to transformative teaching approaches, and a tension emerges between early childhood arts pedagogy and teacher preparation within the neoliberal university. Early childhood arts pedagogy, therefore, can potentially produce sites of resistance to neoliberal social and political structures. The challenges of teaching processual creativity to preservice teachers within a university setting that is itself structured by neoliberal norms will be considered, in conjunction with a discussion of the epistemic possibilities that emerge when neoliberalism’s “economization of heretofore non-economic domains” (Brown, Undoing the demos: Neoliberalism’s stealth revolution, Zone Books, 2015, p. 31) can be undone. Ultimately, we will argue that early childhood arts pedagogies can open spaces and places that are sites of resistance to neoliberal norms, despite early childhood education’s imbrication with institutions structured by neoliberalism. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.;;;

The research presented in this contribution proposes a rhythm analysis framework for bridging architecture and social sciences to facilitate design interventions that are fine-tuned to the social context in cities. The results identify three aspects of city rhythms: (1) rhythms in the outdoor spaces and around the buildings, conceptualised as “rhythm zones”, (2) rhythms in the care services offered by societal organisations that are hosted in public and semi-public buildings, conceptualised as “rhythm-scapes” and (3) rhythms of ordinary activities that shape the urban social life and interactions, conceptualised as “rhythm spheres”. Each aspect includes different methods for analysing and documenting rhythms, enabling novel possibilities for spatial practices. Focusing on the dynamic quality of physical urban spaces, relations between actors and institutions and interactions between communities creates a bridge between academic research and spatial practice at a level of analysis of the urban social life that is straightforward, replicable and inventive. © (2023), (Lifelong Learning EU).

]";;;;"Soil; Soil Microbiology; microbiology; soil";Soil microbial ecology is a relatively young research field that became established around the middle of the 20th century and has grown considerably since then. We analyze two epistemic re-orientations in the field, asking how possibilities for creating do-able problems within current conditions of research governance and researchers’ collective sense-making about new, more desirable modes of research were intertwined in these developments. We show that a first re-orientation towards molecular omics studies was comparably straightforward to bring about, because it allowed researchers to gain resources for their work and to build careers—in other words, to create do-able problems. Yet, over time this mode of research developed into a scientific bandwagon from which researchers found it difficult to depart, even as they considered this kind of work as producing mostly descriptive studies rather than exploring interesting and important ecological questions. Researchers currently wish to re-orient their field again, towards a new mode of conducting ‘well-rounded’ interdisciplinary and ecologically-relevant studies. This re-orientation is, however, not easy to put into practice. In contrast to omics studies, this new mode of research does not easily enable the creation of do-able problems for two reasons. First, it is not as readily ‘packaged’ and hence more difficult to align with institutional and funding frameworks as well as with demands for productivity and career building. Second, while the first re-orientation was part of a broader exciting bandwagon across the life sciences and promised apparent discoveries, the current re-orientation goes along with a different sense of novelty, exploring complex environmental relations and building an understanding at the intersection of disciplines, instead of pushing a clearly circumscribed frontier. Ultimately, our analysis raises questions about whether current conditions of research governance structurally privilege particular kinds of scientific re-orientation over others. © The Author(s) 2023.;;;Sim
Mapping-careful-engagement;Mapping careful engagement: From reflexivity to response-ability;"Pihkala, Suvi; Karasti, Helena";2024;Ethical and Methodological Dilemmas in Social Science Interventions: Careful Engagements in Healthcare, Museums, Design and Beyond;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44119-6_3;snowballing Making-time-for-soil;;;;;;;This chapter contributes to the theorisation of 'careful engagement' by exploring the affordances of the notion and praxis of response-ability for thinking about our engagements with the worlds of our enquiry. The present work stems from the recent upsurge of feminist new materialist and posthuman approaches that have spurred the reimagination of the ethics and politics of knowledge production and the rethinking of questions such as how we understand our role in shaping the world and with whom and what (else) we are engaging. These questions are underpinned by the understanding that knowing is a material doing with ethicality and care at its marrow. Inspired by this idea, this chapter employs the notion of response-ability to consider the ethics and politics of engagement in the authors' participatory research and development process. Returning to their efforts to engage well and with reflexive sensitivity-and to articulate this effort as they have done over the years-the authors draw on response-ability to better capture the intricacies and trouble at stake in enacting and embodying care in their engaged practice. With the help of response-ability, the chapter brings forth the layers of careful engagement that become unveiled when the focus is shifted from the autonomous, reflexively aware researcher to the intra-active dynamisms of the world. For careful engagement, slowing down with this unfolds as a matter of attentive curiosity, responsiveness and commitment to stay with the trouble of the complexities of engaging in and as part of the world. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.
