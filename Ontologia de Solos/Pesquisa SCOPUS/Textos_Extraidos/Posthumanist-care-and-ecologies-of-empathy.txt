ABSTRACT
HCI nature:culture dialogues have recently gained traction, high-
lighting ample opportunities for investigation. In this paper we
look at the potential of locative games in fostering caring engage-
ment with natural/cultural heritage. We present the results of a
contextual study that explores the nature:culture duality of the
Levada walks on Madeira Island and their intrinsic playfulness as a
natural landscape. Through a combination of narrative self-reports
and cultural probes, we conducted an on-site investigation of the
motivations and embodied experiences of hiking these trails, dis-
tilling an empirical epistemology of human-nature interactions. By
unpacking the various realities and tensions on the ground through
a feminist ethics of care and posthuman lens, we provide insight
into the design of future locative interactive technologies to support
and encourage human-nature interaction. Our findings address and
promote values of engagement and conservation in cultural and
natural heritage through a nature:culture continuum.

In design research and human-computer interaction (HCI), one
emerging area of interest is how digital technology intersects with
the natural environments and nature at large [ 115]. Recently, in
light of the joint climate and biodiversity crises, cultural heritage
has been looked at as closely coupled with nature [ 13,40]. The
study described in this paper situates itself at this crossroads, fo-
cusing on the potential of location-based interactive technologies,
such as locative games (LGs), to enhance engagement with and
social visiting practices at cultural and natural heritage sites within
a posthumanist paradigm of care [ 32,54,92]. Here we refer to Mon-
tola’s definition of LGs as games that exert their action across three
dimensions: temporal, spatial and social [ 2,68,102]. Therefore, we
explore the potential of LGs to change the experience of the places
for those present in those locations, be them playing or not [68].
In this paper, we examine the potential of the UNESCO-protected
natural sites of the Levadas nature walks of the Madeira Islands,
an instance of nature:culture heritage [ 40] that symbolizes the
intricate balance between conservation, culture and tourism as a
unique setting with the potential for LGs — tools that enable visitors
to see places ‘with new eyes’, revealing hidden aspects and creating
new types of interaction [ 67]. Despite the Levadas ’ dual role as vital
infrastructure — water canals — and a cultural-natural asset, these
sites still face tensions between conservation needs and tourism
demands [35, 73].
1.1 Research questions and design contributions
This paper is driven by an interrogation of the potential role of
interactive technologies, and particularly LGs, in enhancing experi-
ences, conservation efforts and visitor engagement at cultural and
natural heritage sites. Focusing on nature:culture engagement and
visitor experiences at such sites, we ask how location-based solu-
tions foster caring engagement with natural and cultural heritage,
specifically in the context of the Levadas of Madeira Island, as well
as what the motivations and embodied experiences of those walking
theLevadas , and how a nuanced understanding of these experi-
ences can offer design opportunities for engaging in location-based
HCI. Our investigation has also been urged by a need to scrutinize
how LGs may navigate the tensions between conservation needs
and tourism demands at sites such as the Levadas . Ultimately, the
current paper looks ahead into the potential implications that our
81

findings have for future design and development of LGs within
natural-cultural heritage sites.
Our efforts align with the current push towards integrating prin-
ciples of care [ 54,62] and sustainability [ 29] within the field of
HCI. Instead of creating technologies to exploit our interactions
with nature for mere utilitarian purposes, we aim to foster design
innovations and interactions that encourage us to appreciate and
nurture the natural environment. Under this lens, the environment
and its heritage sites are not viewed as resources to be used at
our convenience and for our mere pleasure but as environments
of mutual living that deserve our affection and reverence. Conse-
quently, we reject the notion of technology as a means to exploit
nature, instead emphasizing its role in facilitating environmentally
friendly and compassionate interactions between all its inhabitants
and visitors.
Our research holds significance for the design research com-
munity as it provides exploratory insight into the intersection of
digital technology with cultural and natural conservation, a critical
issue in an era where technology and the environment increas-
ingly intersect [ 23]. We hope that the empirical insights gained
will be pivotal for natural heritage conservation, enhancing visitor
experiences while contributing to our understanding of how digital
interventions can sustainably enhance local values and economies.
Our methodologies include on-site studies with various partic-
ipant groups at the Levadas . To support this approach, we em-
ployed qualitative tools — visitors’ narrative self-reports and cul-
tural probes (sensory maps and visitor postcards) — to capture
a holistic view of visitor motivations and engagements with na-
ture:culture.
The paper is structured to first delve into the theoretical back-
ground and literature review, followed by a methodology section.
We then present our findings and discuss their implications for HCI,
conservation and tourism. Finally, we conclude with reflections on
potential technological interventions in enhancing people’s experi-
ences of, and relationships with, nature.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
This research was motivated by prior work using technology to
tackle the disconnect between humans and nature, focusing on LGs
[4,16,27]. In the following, we summarize the related work and
give contextual information to this paper’s research program.
2.1 Matters of care: a posthumanist and
feminist ethics for nature engagement
Tourism and conservation can coexist beneficially, with engag-
ing experiences at natural heritage sites encouraging visitors to
support conservation efforts [ 117]. Despite growing awareness of
biodiversity issues, the disconnect from nature remains a complex
challenge, exacerbated by diminishing direct human interactions
with natural environments. This trend, noted by ecologists Soga
and Gaston, has led to decreased public health, well-being, and
pro-environmental behaviors, underscoring the urgent need for
re-engagement with nature and a solution for this ‘extinction of
experience’ [15, 63, 90, 100].
A major playground for human-nature interactions, outdoor
activities in natural landscapes partly tackle the disconnect withnature by offering significant health and well-being benefits, en-
hancing mood, cognitive function, and reducing stress and depres-
sion [ 5,42,55,94,103,118]. Still, they are also intertwined with
cultural heritage, reflecting a Western dichotomy that separates
nature from culture, with the former often seen as a resource for
human benefit or conservation [ 13,50]. This perspective, honed
within our Anthropocene era, highlights the profound impact of
human activity on nature, urging a reevaluation of nature as part
of our heritage and emphasizing a collective responsibility towards
its preservation [20, 59, 81].
Recent work has mindfully investigated the potential of human-
nature interactions in inspiring “a new wave of joyful forest technol-
ogy that transcends techno-solutionism and focuses on alternative
values of joy and care” [ 3], attempting to reconnect urban pop-
ulations with nature [ 111], support conservation of endangered
wildlife [ 79] or look into gardeners’ biodiversity relations [ 93].
While it has been suggested that technology can enhance our re-
lationship with nature [ 108], the effectiveness of these tools in
fostering nature connections is debated [ 96]. Such preoccupation
with caring for — and enjoying the experience of — nature has
drawn from feminist and posthuman insight into human-nature
and nature/culture dyads (or, as some would argue, continuum)
[34,54,71,97,104], “showing how everything is closely connected
within a complex system and demonstrating the need to converge
different viewpoints and movements that have similar and coherent
aims at their base” [51].
As a meta-ecological framework, posthumanist care extends be-
yond traditional human-centered approaches to include the agency
and value of non-human entities, emphasizing ethical and relational
engagement with the more-than-human world while recognizing
the interconnectedness of all life forms [ 54]. Caring within this
context manifests as active practices that honor the intrinsic worth
of nature and encourage mutual respect and sustainable interac-
tions across species, enhancing conservation efforts by shifting
the focus from purely human interests to a more holistic approach
that values the well-being and agency of the more-than-human
world [ 49,54,93]. By fostering collaborative stewardship and ethi-
cal responsibility, a posthumanist care ethics challenges traditional
human-centered views, emphasizing the interconnected, holistic
relationship between humans and the broader natural world and
is attentive to more-than-human perspectives as it recognizes the
agency and value of non-human entities [ 6,11,24,54,89]. As articu-
lated in Bellacasa’s Matters of Care [89], for instance, a posthumanist
ethics of care subsequently emphasizes a relational approach that
actively engages with the world in ethical and political ways.
Attitudes to care have, for instance, demonstrated the importance
of recognizing diverse interdependent temporalities and disrupt-
ing anthropocentric progress-driven models [ 88] and encouraged
expanding the moral community of care to include non-human
persons [ 11]. By emphasizing learning to care for non-humans as
kin, practices of care make it possible to “embrace diverse kinds of
more-than-human entanglements” [ 24,107]. Extending these in-
sights into the generation of locative HCI experiences suggests the
potential of meaningful, reciprocal interactions with non-human
entities.
82
Posthumanist Care and Ecologies of Empathy Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
Our study highlights how design directions in locative HCI can
integrate feminist care ethics by prioritizing empathetic and eth-
ical interactions with both natural and cultural heritage that are
also equitable, socially just and attentive to diverse experiences.
By acknowledging the complexities and tensions inherent in the
landscape, our research opens up possibilities for technologies
that honor and support the agency of non-human entities, while
also fostering respectful, collaborative relationships among visitors,
building on work centering research in HCI and interaction design
around concerns for care and our successful and fruitful coexistence
with the more-than-human entities in our planet [ 19,62]. Addition-
ally, the focus on the playful potential of the Levada walks aligns
with feminist care ethics’ emphasis on creativity and emotional
engagement as part of caring practices, opening space to challenge
traditional conceptions of care [ 49]. Suggesting potentials for the
design of locative technologies that encourage playful, immersive
experiences, this study challenges traditional human-centered ap-
proaches and contributes to a more dynamic, ethical engagement
with both natural and cultural heritage [ 45,109], while opening
new avenues that promote a sense of stewardship and connection
with nature and culture.
2.2 Locative technologies for nature
Pyle’s formulated ‘extinction of experience’ — the “ongoing alien-
ation of humans from nature” [ 90,100] — risks biodiversity conser-
vation and highlights the need to understand and enhance these
connections [ 101]. In this paper, we investigate how a deeper explo-
ration of the dynamics of human-nature relationships may inform
the design of technologies that enrich these interactions. Recently,
nature-inspired HCI strengthening human-nature bonds has flour-
ished, with attempts at linking HCI to posthuman ecologies empha-
sizing the role of technology in ecological storytelling and nature
connection [ 18,25,37,54,61,66,75,86,95]. The application of
augmented, virtual and mixed reality (AR, VR and MR, respectively)
hold promise for tackling environmental issues, both in promoting
awareness and action for nature and its ecosystems [ 91]. While rec-
ognizing that the use of these technologies in nature may represent
a “double-edged sword whose implementation warrants as much
attention in HCI as in environmental science” [ 84] or promoting a
loss of contact with the lived experience of nature at the expense
of an intense use of technology [ 53], the possibilities afforded by
the potential immersion in more-than-human realities should be
investigated for their promotion of involvement with natural spaces
[1,30], particularly via interactions that do not require players to
look at their screen while in the wild [57].
Extending on the liminal interactive space between humans
and technology [ 112], current HCI research has been proposed as
undergoing a fourth wave in which humans, more-than-humans
and digital technologies are appreciated as entangled [39].
In this entangled space, LGs represent a fusion of virtual and
physical realms, offering humans potentially immersive and in-
teractive experiences that overlay digital content onto complex
ecosystems of real-world and more-than-human environments
[25,41,121]. Using GPS and other location-based technologies,
LGs enable players to interact with virtual elements within specific
physical locations, such as engaging in geocaching, scavenger hunts,and narrative adventures that unfold as they traverse different ar-
eas [ 31,65,86,121]. LGs also facilitate “placemaking through play,
enhancing the careful processes that form places out of layered net-
works of affection, habit, and social bonds” while fostering motiva-
tion in players who interact with a narrative dispersed across a phys-
ical geography [ 33,64], allowing participants to “rediscover familiar
places and see hidden relationships” [ 67]. In particular, heritage LGs
often incorporate digital guided tours, interactive educational expe-
riences, and narrative gaming strategies, transforming heritage sites
into dynamic engagement spaces [ 12,22,76,82,85,114]. Research
has also highlighted the significant impact of LGs on user engage-
ment, stimulating cognitive and motor skills, and creating emotional
bonds between users and the locations they explore [ 14,21,41,119],
as these technologies merge storytelling with physical exploration,
making experiences more memorable, and encouraging repeat vis-
its and positive recommendations [ 44,60]. Furthermore, LGs allow
for unpredictable play beyond navigation [ 72], enhance social in-
teraction while promoting group participation, collaboration and a
sense of community [70, 74, 77, 80, 83, 120].
LGs are thus particularly promising in addressing the human-
nature disconnect. By integrating game mechanics with physical
outdoor activities, LGs can motivate people to explore natural envi-
ronments, enhancing their connection to these spaces while foster-
ing a sense of care for them and promoting engagement with nature
through the liminal space between player and narrative [ 54,58].
By focusing on the application of LGs, we aim to reverse nature
disengagement and support conservation efforts through digital
interventions [ 105,119], providing implications for the design of
LGs with a clear agenda for “societal impact and cultural values”
that “spread awareness about [nature preservation]” [56].
However, the consistent application of LGs in natural heritage
sites, and the development of effective digital narrative strategies
for engagement, require further exploration [ 26]. By weaving narra-
tives and challenges into specific locations, these HCI tools encour-
age players to experience the more-than-human networks firsthand,
fostering a sense of oneness with the planet we inhabit [18, 105].
3 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
The present research methodology was carefully crafted to better
understand which aspects to consider when designing for engage-
ment in and with the specific cultural and natural heritage site of
theLevadas . A qualitative on-site research approach was chosen
because of its ability to capture individuals’ nuanced and subjec-
tive realities, allowing for a rich, textured understanding of their
interactions with the environment, their motivation and embod-
ied experiences while walking and immersing themselves along
theLevadas of Madeira. Our engagement with Madeira, as part
of the LoGaCulture project, occurred over four months from late
summer throughout autumn 2023, when we collected data from nar-
rative self-reports and cultural probes and analyzed them through
a reflective thematic analysis during and after the collection.
Our research builds on recent work on care and sustainability
within HCI research [ 29,54,62]. As we strive to develop design
solutions and technologies that appreciate — and promote sustain-
able behaviors and engagement with — the natural world of which
we are an integral part, our use of cultural probes and self-reports
83
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Galvão-Ferreira, et al.
allows us to delve into the expectations and variety of experience
of being in nature:culture. As societies, technology and the myriad
relationships with the natural world change, it is important to stim-
ulate tighter connections with more-than-human realities brought
about by new approaches to technology [51].
Our study focuses on the Madeira Island Levadas as they rep-
resent an extraordinary epitome of nature as heritage: man-made
irrigation channels that have become integral to the island’s tourism
and heritage landscape [ 35,69,78,99]. These channels, dating back
to the fifteenth century, serve their primary irrigation function and
provide unique trekking experiences through Madeira’s diverse
natural environments, including the UNESCO-recognized Laurel
Forest (the Laurisilva of Madeira). The Levadas attract a wide range
of users and have become a focal point for narratives that enhance
the tourist experience, offering deep immersion in the island’s nat-
ural beauty [ 36,73,106]. As simultaneously natural and cultural
sites, the Madeira Levadas are — as we explore in this study — a per-
fect test case where a community’s engagement with local natural
and cultural heritage can be investigated, foregrounding spaces for
location-based solutions crafted through a posthumanist ethics of
care that curates and salvages human-nature:culture interactions.
3.1 Narrative self-reports
At the start of our fieldwork, our data collection was focused on
getting first-hand insights from people who would walk the Lev-
adas and share their experiences with us through reflective reports.
For this purpose, we took over what Cohn calls an “opportunistic
spontaneity” [ 17], while recognizing “the need to expand [our] de-
sign practices in ways that respond to the idiosyncratic character of
nature-related research, with all its messiness and unpredictability”
[107]. Such opportunism acknowledges tracking the traces within
the field in a situational openness and productively uses the limits
of plannability in the research process. We followed a series of op-
portunities — from engaging with tour operators, leveraging walks
with friends and family, to organizing Levada trips as part of the Câ-
mara de Lobos municipality in Madeira — and asked 19 participants,
with ages ranging roughly from 18 to 60 years of age, to write and
hand in a self-report about the experiences of their Levada walk.
These reports were collected from a variety of participants, from
single individuals to couples, family members and groups of friends
(typically brought together by the Câmara de Lobos municipality
as part of wellness programs). Through this practice, we collected
self-reports from both Madeira locals and tourists, varying in length
and style of writing (some reports were brief and straightforwardly
factual, while others stretched in longer detail, providing personal
reflections and autobiographical stories in more elaborate prose),
covering walks across eight different Levadas of differing durations
and difficulty (including Levada dos Balcões), in August 2023.
3.2 Cultural probes: visitor postcards and
sensory map
Following these early-stage explorations, cultural probes were de-
veloped (under review elsewhere) as a tool for collecting more
specific information about the experience of visiting a Levada and
later informing the design of heritage-related digital games. The
development of these tools built on feminist posthuman approaches,focusing on the relational aspects of nature:culture to elicit sensory,
speculative, situated, embodied and affective aspects relating to
nature:culture heritage(s). Our cultural probes built on research
that highlights such instruments as meaningful research tools for
eliciting subjective, contextual, and often obscured aspects of every-
day human experiences for inspiring design processes [ 43,52], and
argue for the importance of pluralistic and situated interpretations,
adoptions, and adaptations [ 122]. In the context of our exploration,
and with an interest in more-than-human aspects at cultural and
natural heritage sites, these in-the-wild approaches [ 58] seemed
promising in exploring various aspects that could later inform our
design.
The probes here implemented consisted of a set of visitor post-
cards and a sensory map. The sensory map was designed to provide
rich descriptive data about the multi-sensory experiences of the
Levadas , capturing not just what the participants saw but what they
heard, smelled, touched, and felt emotionally. The map contained
detailed instructions on how to perform the activity, advising partic-
ipants to stop for a total of five times across the hike, writing down
the approximate location of each stop; in each of the five stops, par-
ticipants were invited to reply to a set of prompts/questions (“What
can you see? List your 5 favorite things”; “What can you smell?”;
“What can you hear?”; “What can you touch or feel?”; “How does it
feel to be there?”; “How is the space around you?”; “If you have to
remember one thing from this place, what would it be and why?”).
The ten postcards invited participants through ten questions to
share their experiences, hopes, thoughts, and expectations (1) If
theLevadas could talk, what would they tell you?; 2) What would
you like a future visitor to notice about this place?; 3) What do you
particularly enjoy about the Levada and what makes it special to
you?; 4) What is sacred to you?; 5) What challenges did you have
to overcome to get here?; 6) To some visitors and residents, you
are a giant. What do you think the smaller ones make of us?; 7)
How would you like to be remembered?; 8) If you could send a
message to a visitor in the past, what would you ask or tell them
about?; 9) If you could visit the Levadas in the distant past or future,
what would you imagine seeing and hearing?; 10) How can this
place better serve you and what would you like to see improved?)
How can this place better serve you, and what would you like to
see improved?]; K) Back display of one of the visitor postcards).
Both probes were implemented in late November 2023 during two
visits to Levada dos Balcões , a short 1.5-kilometer trail. A total of 23
participants, with ages ranging roughly from 18 to 55 years of age,
were recruited from the University of Madeira local undergraduate
population and Erasmus+ international mobility programme, as
well as by reaching out to Portuguese and international residents
connected to local friends and family, and invited to interact with
and fill in these probes. Two researchers accompanied these excur-
sions and were available to answer any questions about the probes
but otherwise remained in the background, allowing the probes to
speak for themselves.
3.3 Post- Levada online survey
After the Levada walks, the researchers asked the participants who
interacted with the cultural probes to fill an online questionnaire —
responded to by 21 out of 23 participants — containing questions
84
Posthumanist Care and Ecologies of Empathy Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
addressing the experience of walking the Levadas (e.g., “How did
you inform yourself upfront about the Levada?”, “Indicate the main
reasons why you were interested in this tour [of the Levadas ]?”,
“How do you prefer to do nature walks/hikes”, or “Did you come to
this Levada walk with any friends/colleagues/family?”), on phone
and social media use during the walks (“Did you use your phone
during the walk and if yes, what for?”, “Did you, or are you planning
to share your experiences with others?” or “If you created any social
media posts, which social networks did you post in?”) as well on
the cultural probes themselves (e.g., “Which new perspectives did
the sensory map bring to your engagement with the environment?”
or “Overall, how do you rate the tool [the postcard probes] to foster
imagination towards more inclusive and ecological futures?”) and
general demographic information.
3.4 Data analysis
The theoretical framework guiding our explorative data collection
and subsequent analysis was deeply inspired by posthuman and
new materialist thinking [ 8,9,47,48]. All authors have walked and
experienced the Levadas themselves. By embracing our position
as a determining factor and framing our sense-making as situated
and embodied process within an entangled environment [ 46,110],
this very personal and involvement allowed us to draw particularly
deep insights and analytical conclusions about implicit knowledge
during the analysis.
Consequently, meaning-making had already started during data
collection but intensified during the analysis stage, where we used
reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) [ 10] to examine the data from
the reports and transcribed annotated probes collectively. Two
authors performed individual coding and clustering of the data
from the probes and reports, compared their results, discussed any
conflicts and merged their results, which were discussed with the
other two authors. In a second round, the authors looked for de-
sign potentials that were then discussed and collectively agreed on
among all authors. Application of RTA to this data output provided
a nuanced and in-depth understanding of human-nature:culture
relations. Aside from allowing for flexibility in data interpretation,
RTA enabled a comprehensive and multi-layered examination of the
data. By allowing for a diversity of themes, we were able to gain a
deeper understanding of the complexities of human-nature:culture
interactions, which, in their own turn, informed the strategies to
foster more meaningful and sustainable relationships with the en-
vironment, described below.
4 FINDINGS: DESIGN DIRECTIONS AND
POTENTIALS
4.1 Post-Levada online survey data and
participant demographics
Responses to the experiential questions of the survey revealed that
the vast majority of participants (66.7%) did not inform themselves
ahead of their Levada walk (leaving the experience to speak on
this own, with little or no prior knowledge of it; with a little over
14% of participants having checked social media and another 14%
having sourced information from friends, family or colleagues), a
considerable variety of reasons to walk the Levadas (in spite of76.2% of participants pointing our “experiencing nature” as their
main driver), the near totality — 90.5% of participants — preferring
to do nature walks accompanied by friends, family or colleagues
and 76.2% of participants having performed their Levada walks
accompanied by friends, family or colleagues. On social media, the
vast majority of participants — 85.7% — signaled that they had taken
photos during their walk, that they were planning on telling their
friends and family about their experience (76.2% of participants,
with 28.6% of them replying that they would be doing so through
social media) and 68.8% of participants noted Instagram as the
social media platform in which they would be creating posts (if
they decided to post content on the walk).
Regarding the cultural probes, most participants highlighted
the value of the sensory map in driving focus and attention to
the experience of the walk (with participants reporting that the
map had “made [them] think a little more deeply about [their]
surroundings”, that it made them “stop, think, look and listen”,
“slow down and absorb [their] surroundings” or “helped [them]
think more about [their] senses and noticing more details”), with a
large majority of participants — 61.9% — signaling that the map had
directed their attention towards a deeper sensuous experience of
theLevadas ; while on the postcard probes most participants valued
their artwork and the way that questions made them reflect on
their experience (with participants highlighting “the pictures”, “the
artwork” and “the images”, while others wrote that “the questions
made [them] think about things [they] would normally overlook”,
“made [them] relate the walk to [their] life outside the walk” or that
they “liked that [the postcard probes] were stimulating [them] into
thinking deeper”), with 47.6% of participants rating these probes
with 4 out of 5, and 28.6% of participants with 5 out of 5, regarding
the tool’s potential to foster imagination towards more inclusive
and ecological futures.
Demographics data quantified 52.4% of participants as aged be-
tween 18 and 24 years-old, with the next most representative age
gap — above 54 years-old — representing 23.8% of participants;
the gender balance of participants as relatively even, with 52.4%
of participants self-identifying as female and 47.6% as male; and
the majority — 57.1% of participants — marking that they were a
permanent/long-term resident or natural od the Madeira Islands,
with the remaining 42.9% of participants stating that they were
non-permanent residents of Madeira.
The following section presents the findings from our RTA [ 10].
Themes emerging from the self-reports and cultural probes were
refined and revisited with a special focus on how design and play
potentials — “experiences that are inherently playful and might
thus inspire novel and increasingly joyful types of [nature-related]
tech” [ 3] — might be relevant to inspire inclusive, sustainable and
more-than-human game design in heritage contexts and make them
actionable (Fig. 1), data that was complemented with that derived
from the post-walk surveys. This higher-level clustering allowed
us to foreground design directions that we present in the following
subsections as inspirational starting points for designing LGs in
conflicted natural and cultural heritage sites. These themes were:
Appreciation of Scenic and Natural Beauty (in which the views
and landscape of the Levadas , and their role in immersing and
connecting participants with these natural spaces and their experi-
ential/pedagogical value, are highlighted); Mindfulness, Relaxation
85
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Galvão-Ferreira, et al.
and Mental Well-being (which speaks to the stress relief, men-
tal health benefits and relaxation experienced during the Levada
walks); Relationship with Nature and Environmental Awareness
of Human Impact and Preservation (that represents participants’
considerable connection with the natural world, including its fauna
and flora, and the impact that harmful human activity has in the
environment); Exploration, Adventure and Exercise (under which
participants signaled their sense of adventure and enthusiasm for
discovery and exploration of the Levadas , and the role of these
walks in their exercise activities); Cultural/Historical Appreciation
and Significance (which focused on the historical and cultural con-
text of the Levadas , the populations that are connected with them
and the stories/lessons that may be learned from them); Personal
and Group Experiences and Social Connection (which signaled par-
ticipants’ emphasis on the social dimensions of the Levada walks,
including exchanges and interactions throughout the trails); Per-
sonal Achievement and Satisfaction (grouping the sense of accom-
plishment that participants reported and their experience with the
striking beauty of the Levadas ); Reflection, Introspection and Spir-
itual/Philosophical Insights (which summed the engagement of
participants in self-reflection, moments of introspection and in-
stances of pause and insight); Overcoming Obstacles and Physical
Challenges (which focused on the occasionally physically demand-
ing nature of the Levada walks and the physical benefits of the
associated exercise); Challenges of Navigation, Safety and Accessi-
bility (which summed participants’ noting of the navigation and
accessibility challenges represented by some sections of some of
theLevadas ).
4.2 Design directions and potentials
Themes were then grouped into design directions — Cultivating
Empathetic Connections and Holistic Education; Encouraging Col-
lective Stewardship and Community Resilience; Reflecting and Re-
specting Diverse Narratives and Agencies; and Fostering Inclusivity
and Adaptability in Interconnected Ecosystems — and potentials
[3], that aim at foregrounding caring aspects in visiting, thus open-
ing exciting opportunities for design in conservation sites that face
the challenge of balancing over-tourism and nature experience and
conservation (Fig. 1). The following subsections present these four
design directions (DD-1 to DD-4) and articulate the nine resulting
design potentials (DP-a to DP-i).
4.2.1 Design Direction 1 (DD-1): Cultivating Empathetic Connec-
tions and Holistic Education.
Our first design direction indicated the importance of scaffolding
the interaction between visitors and the rich Levadas and the Lau-
risilva forest ecosystem, fostering a deep, empathetic understanding
of the natural world and its complex interdependencies. Through
engaging locative technologies, this design direction encourages
holistic visitor learning, supporting a shift from mere knowledge ac-
quisition to a profound, experiential understanding and emotional
connection with the environment.•Design Potential a (DP-a): Enhancing Immersive Expe-
riences and Empathy through Multi-Sensory Engage-
ment
Participants noted the transformative power of immersive
experiences in creating deep connections with nature: by
“recognizing [the Levadas ] as an opportunity [for us] to bond
and immerse ourselves in the beauty of nature”, pointing out
“the sights, sounds, and smells that immersed [them] in the
natural environment” or describing the feeling of being “sur-
rounded by lush vegetation [that] offers a unique feeling of
being immersed in nature”. Both through our sensory maps
and postcard probes, they shared moments of awe and won-
der in the landscapes (seeing the “Levada adventure [...] not
just a physical exploration but also a metaphorical one — a
journey of self-discovery, of reconnection with the wonders
of nature”), with one describing standing atop a cliff overlook-
ing the forest as a profound experience of aesthetic sublime
and connectedness (the “view of the high and imposing cliffs
surrounding a lagoon with crystal clear waters [that was]
absolutely mesmerizing”, meaning that they “were amazed
by the beauty of [that] place”), while another reported simi-
lar connectedness when surrounded by trees in the forest:
“As I immersed myself in the enchanting surroundings, I
couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude for the gift they
had bestowed upon us — a remarkable system that not only
sustains life but also allows us to experience the natural won-
ders of Madeira in such a unique way”. These experiences led
to initial design ideas for intentionally creating immersive
environments that nurture empathy and emotional connec-
tion with nature. Discussions involved interactive elements
such as AI-powered dialogues with nature to encourage vis-
itors to notice the ecosystem and "hear" the forest; an AR
treasure hunt that could highlight historical and folk stories
along trails, connecting human perception with wildlife ex-
periences; and off-site VR journeys that could simulate the
Laurisilva ecosystem’s life cycle, offering insights into its
delicate balance and creating a feeling of interconnectedness.
We noted that VR experiences might also simulate perspec-
tives of non-human entities within the ecosystem, allowing
for the scaling of human sizes and temporalities to match
the species’ perspective for an intimate glimpse into their
lives.
•Design Potential b (DP-b): Creating Dynamic Learning
Environments and Co-Learning with Nature
Our data revealed participants’ interest in informal educa-
tional experiences beyond traditional settings (providing
“moments of sharing, conviviality, deepening and acquir-
ing knowledge, among others, encouraging, above all, good
practices and healthy lifestyles for citizens”), emphasizing
experiential learning and hands-on exploration in nature
(leaving participants not “want[ing] to stop and just explore
and experience the beauty of nature”), combined with ex-
pressions of curiosity and discovery along trails (e.g., as one
participant approached a man-made tunnel and “a sense of
curiosity mixed with a tinge of apprehension washed over
[them]”), while encountering unfamiliar plants and wildlife
86

column).
behavior (listening to “the chorus of birdsong — all of these
sensations [becoming] a part of us, woven into the fabric of
our being” or remarking on the “profusion of flowers, ancient
trees and varied species of plants [that] transformed each
step into an exciting journey of discovery”). This enthusiasm
should inspire designs that promote co-learning with nature,
and which may include interpretive signage and interac-
tive guided experiences for inquiry-based learning. Projects
based on locative technologies could weave narratives across
museums and sites, connecting the Levadas , the forest, and
the broader Madeira ecosystem. ’Eco-mystery’ games could
also challenge players to solve puzzles related to Laurisilva
forest conservation, turning environmental stewardship into
an engaging adventure. Additionally, an app-based learn-
ing game could involve visitors in real-time data collection
about flora and fauna, supporting collaboration with local
conservation agencies, thus fostering active, participatory
learning and directly contributing to conservation research.
4.2.2 Design Direction 2 (DD-2): Encouraging Collective Steward-
ship and Community Resilience.
Our second design direction revolves around nurturing a collective
sense of responsibility and care for the Levadas and the Laurisilva
forest. This approach is centered on the belief that preserving thesenatural treasures is a shared duty that binds the community and
its members to a common goal. Through LGs, this direction aims
to engage people not just as visitors but as active participants and
caretakers of the environment, fostering a resilient, supportive com-
munity around the conservation efforts.
•Design Potential c (DP-c): Promoting Environmental
Stewardship and Collaborative Caretaking
Analysis of participants’ data suggested a strong commit-
ment to environmental stewardship, with individuals ex-
pressing a desire to actively preserve and conserve the natu-
ral environment, with one participant pondering on action
that would “help preserve and protect these natural trea-
sures, ensuring that they are accessible and enjoyable for
all”, another highlighting that they “hope to inspire others to
appreciate and protect the natural world around them” while
another stressed that the Levada walks had impacted on their
“relationship with the natural world and influenced [their]
understanding of environmental conservation”. Instances
of noticing trash led to spontaneous clean-up activities and
ideas for restoring disturbed areas along the Levadas (as
one participant “witnessed the intrusion of plastic into the
natural environment”) and the need to have more places to
safely leave waste (with one participant writing that “people
should not throw their trash in the forest”, while another
87
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Galvão-Ferreira, et al.
pleaded for visitors to “please put the trash in the trash can!”),
reflecting a collective wish and effort to protect the ecosys-
tem. These acts prompted reflections on the importance of
collective action and the community’s role in safeguarding
resources, hinting towards designs that can build on this
collective responsibility by offering opportunities for collab-
orative caretaking within the Levadas network. Gamified
apps could reward eco-friendly behaviors, guiding visitors
through the Levadas to identify and report invasive species or
pollution, while digital ’conservation quests’ could integrate
players’ actions into real-world reforestation or preservation
efforts in the Laurisilva forest. Community-led conservation
projects could also engage local and visiting participants
in habitat restoration, combined with interactive exhibits
that could track and display the collective impact of visitor
actions on conservation efforts, providing feedback on the
positive outcomes of collective stewardship.
•Design Potential d (DP-d): Fostering Community En-
gagement and Collaboration, and Kinship with Nature
Data highlighted the importance of the social dimensions of
nature experiences, emphasizing camaraderie in fostering
a sense of belonging and connection with the environment:
the value of “getting to know nature in a way that estab-
lished a unique connection individually and collectively [...]
in addition to developing our social, affective and cogni-
tive domain”, a sense that the Levadas “formed/strengthened
bonds of friendship” and facilitate “both [participants] and
the group of friends [they] went with [to fall] in love with
the view”. Shared exploration along trails created bonds and
celebrated the beauty of nature (with one participant writing
that they had “struck up a conversation with a woman who
had been walking behind [them]”, with the other walker’s
“infectious spirit lift[ing] [their] own, as she sang out loud
and shared amusing jokes” and the fact that they “became
companions, providing each other with much-needed com-
pany for the remainder of the walk”), leading to the recurring
theme of a desire to strengthen connections with the natural
world, the community and its members (one participant even
tells of visiting a shop along a Levada and it “offer[ing] a
selection of local produce and delicacies [provided] an op-
portunity to savor the flavors of Madeira and support the
local community that thrived amidst the natural wonders
of the island”). Game designs could, we suggest, focus on
social aspects by fostering community engagement during
walks. For instance, a community-driven game could encour-
age locals and visitors to share stories and memories linked
to specific locations, fostering shared narratives and com-
munity bonds; such collaborative projects could blend local
folklore with ecological knowledge, creating a layered un-
derstanding of the Laurisilva forest and its cultural context.
AR experiences could additionally overlay historical images
or future scenarios onto the landscape, prompting reflection
and dialogue about sustainable futures, albeit mindful that
these interventions should be subtle, allowing the natural
landscape to dominate technological augmentations.•Design Potential e (DP-e): Creating Shared Moments
of Wonder that Inspire Collaborative Conservation
Participants’ walks were filled with moments of wonder and
surprise (as when dealing with the unpredictability of the
walks, feeling that “curiosity propelled us forward, eager to
uncover the hidden wonders that awaited us”), from spec-
ulating about the future (when the Levadas would become
“more accessible [and] more touristic, less natural or for-
gotten”) to imagining ancient wanderers (in a time when
“everything would grow very wild, very natural, [with] no
trash”), containing experiences of awe that inspired a sense of
communal narrative in response to the beauty of the natural
world (as one participant affirms, “the connections made and
the memories forged during this Levada adventure would be
cherished, serving as a reminder of the joy and sense of com-
munity that can be found in exploring the wonders of nature
together”), encouraging collaborative conservation efforts.
Design potentials could include multi-user LGs that allow
participants to add speculative layers of agents and stories to
the landscape or multi-participant VR experiences could con-
nect people through reconstructed Levadas journeys, even
from different locations.
4.2.3 Design Direction 3 (DD-3): Honoring Diverse Narratives and
Agencies.
Our third design direction is interested in the diverse stories the
various actors could tell, honoring the multifaceted nature of the
heritage site. Currently, the most salient stories of the Levadas
underline the utilitarian purpose of these water channels and the
grand narrative of the heroic tale of masculine engineering, but
equally their biodiversity value [ 35,73,78,87,113]. This direction
intends to provide a platform for the myriad voices of the region,
from more-than-human to the local human communities that have
nurtured and been nurtured by the land.
•Design Potential f (DP-f): Integrating Local Multispecies
Culture, Wisdom and Knowledge Sharing
Participants showed deep respect for local indigenous cul-
ture and traditional wisdom, expressing a desire to learn
from and honor these systems (either through the “charming
village[s found along the way,] known for [their] traditional
crafts and picturesque scenery”, the — found in a nativity
scene staged in a village along one Levada — “traditional
representation of the birth of Jesus Christ performed dur-
ing Christmas” or the “shelves adorned with locally made
crafts, intricate woodwork, and handmade souvenirs whis-
pered stories of the island’s rich heritage” found along the
way), while encounters with local flora, fauna, and tradi-
tional stories sparked curiosity and reflection about the natu-
ral world and its cultural heritage (from “the various old and
abandoned houses that [are] found along the route, which
made [one participant] reflect on the experiences that had
already passed there, the stories that these people had to
tell” to the “many familiar faces [found along the way and
that] allow[ed one participant] to reconnect and reminisce
about [their] shared past [as they] embarked on a collective
88
Posthumanist Care and Ecologies of Empathy Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
journey down memory lane”, “stories and anecdotes from
years gone by filled the air, creating a delightful tapestry
of nostalgia” and they “laughed, shared tales of mischief
and innocence, and rekindled the bonds that had faded with
time”), suggesting the need to foster respectful, symbiotic
relationships between humans and nature through knowl-
edge sharing while amplifying the voices of diverse species.
This approach encourages a critical reassessment of tradi-
tional narratives to uncover biases and promote inclusive
interpretations, pointing towards interactive media experi-
ences that can connect human and non-human knowledge,
incorporating Madeiran folklore, songs, and dances. These
experiences may highlight conservation efforts and natural
remedies, offering site-specific or museum-based insights,
allowing participants to report back on their newly acquired
knowledge in nature, enriching their understanding.
•Design Potential g (DP-g): Facilitating Reflective and
Contemplative Spaces for Co-Existence
Participants highlighted the importance of spaces for reflec-
tion and contemplation (the participants that can’t “help
but reflect on the passage of time and the importance of
seizing the present moment”, the “peaceful evening [that
provides] the perfect ambiance to reflect on the experiences,
grateful for the spontaneity that had made the day so mem-
orable”, the “reflect[ions] on [their] childhood memories of
exploring the woods, climbing trees, and discovering hid-
den streams”, the instances spent “contemplat[ing] the emo-
tional solace and inspiration [they] derive from spending
time outdoors” or the space to “contemplate nature, namely
the fauna and flora that exist[s] there”), with individuals
seeking quiet, secluded areas for introspection and spiri-
tual renewal, emphasizing the restorative effects of solitude:
from the participant who “consider[s] [the Levada walks] to
be an activity capable of achieving so much alone, enhanc-
ing a space of self-knowledge, through which we stop to
reflect and breathe, to be in silence with nature, enjoying
everything it has for us”, those who point out the “sounds of
silence” and the experience of hearing “nothing, silence”, to
those who discover “secluded spots along the walk where
[they] could sit, relax and tune in to the gentle murmurs of
nature around [them]”. Designs might create reflective and
contemplative spaces, such as sanctuaries for quiet medita-
tion or sound or silent walks through conservation areas,
with ’listening spots’ additionally attuning visitors to the
ecosystem’s sounds, fostering a sense of oneness with nature.
Locative audio experiences might also offer immersive ambi-
ent sounds based on location, enhancing the Laurisilva forest
experience, while geo-tagged digital diaries could enable vis-
itors to share reflections, building a collective narrative of
personal connections. Additionally, AR layers of informa-
tion could ultimately be implemented to aid visualization
of unseen communications like plant signals or water flow,
deepening visitors’ understanding of natural processes.4.2.4 Design Direction 4 (DD-4): Fostering Inclusivity and Adapt-
ability in Interconnected Ecosystems.
Our fourth design direction champions the natural world’s dy-
namism and its visitors’ diversity. This approach is dedicated to
crafting experiences accessible to all, resonating with the adaptive
and ever-evolving nature of ecosystems like the Levadas and the
Laurisilva forest in times of climate change.
•Design Potential h (DP-h): Incorporating Co-Adaptive
and Resilient Designs
Participant data highlighted the dynamic, ever-changing na-
ture of the environment, emphasizing weather variability
(the desire of being “lucky with the weather”, the “recom-
mend[ation] to check the weather forecast, especially during
the rainy season, as the terrain can be slippery and less safe”,
with one participant complaining that “the weather [had
taken] a sudden turn, enveloping [then] in dense fog and
rain”), trail erosion and variability (the “steep edges of the
trail [that] made [one participant] nervous” or the “over-
grown vegetation [that] obscured the trail,”), and habitat
disturbances (the seemingly inevitable “environmental is-
sues that concern [one participant], such as climate change
[that results in] habitat destruction”), chiefly as participants
navigated diverse ecosystems and expressed a need for trail
infrastructure that could withstand natural forces while min-
imizing impact on the landscape (e.g., by keeping “well-
maintained trails and flat ground.”). Designing with natu-
ral heritage sites in the Anthropocene requires adaptive,
resilient approaches that foster a co-adaptive relationship
between humans and nature, under which embracing spon-
taneity and unpredictability may lead to designs that cele-
brate the unexpected and adapt to real-time data on climate
patterns. Adaptive LGs might modify scenarios based on
real-time environmental data, such as fog, wind, or rain, en-
gaging visitors with the Laurisilva forest’s dynamic nature
while playing, which, combined with AI technologies, can
create versatile, responsive experiences aligned with the en-
vironment’s specificities.
•Design Potential i (DP-i): Designing for Accessibility
and Inclusivity While Cultivating Spaces of Belonging
The diversity of participants, each with unique abilities and
backgrounds, emphasized the need for inclusive and accessi-
ble trail experiences (highlighting the trails that are “very
accessible [...] for most people”, the “higher level of difficulty”
in other Levadas , for which the “difficulty rating is difficult”,
theLevadas that “in terms of difficulty, [one participant]
found [...] to be intermediate”, “the Levada[s that] present
some difficulties along the way [and] therefore [one other
participant] would not recommend [...] to everyone”, the
need to “preserve and protect these natural treasures, en-
suring that they are accessible and enjoyable for all”), with
individuals of various ages and physical abilities enjoying
the Levada walks, often overcoming challenges to access
natural spaces (while recognizing “[these] experience[s as]
more challenging and motivating”, the “more challenging
89
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Galvão-Ferreira, et al.
sections, with steep climbs and narrow paths” or the Levadas
that are “a little more challenging in certain sections [yet
remain] accessible to most people in good physical condition
and willing to explore nature”). Accordingly, digital designs
should focus on creating accessible spaces within the Lev-
adas network, ensuring everyone feels welcome and part of
nature — e.g., games with accessibility modes could cater to
a diverse range of abilities, with multi-lingual or nonverbal
storytelling celebrating the cultural diversity of Madeira’s
visitors while fostering an inclusive community of nature
enthusiasts.
5 DISCUSSION
As the tourism industry continues to flourish, niche destinations
are at risk. However, it is important that the growth of the travel
and tourism sector continues in Madeira, as this industry generates
robust revenues for this region [ 38], representing about 25 to 30% of
regional PIB. This growth in tourism investment and development
should nonetheless take place in an open and sustainable manner
[28,98]. As has been pointed out by others, ecological applications
of cross-reality technologies are not yet widely researched or ap-
plied, leaving potential to be realized [ 91]. As such, the authors
believe that it is essential to provide inspiration for design direc-
tions for the further protection and restoration of nature, habitats,
and biodiversity in such niche and biodiversity-rich destinations.
In the rest of this section, we articulate four main points of
discussion that emerged from our findings:
5.1 Locative game potentials
Our situated and embodied engagement within nature revealed
design directions that can enrich heritage experiences and support
their conservation. They shed light on caring aspects and directed
our attention towards moments where technology could be imple-
mented as less utilitarian but positively impact the environment.
By articulating these felt and observed experiences as design po-
tentials, we contribute to the discussion on locative media design
interventions in the wild to care ever more for nature, to connect
with it, and to become one with nature [93].
In further developing and implementing our proposed design
directions and potentials, we must be mindful of their sensory
limitations in making more-than-human realities “look and feel ‘like
the real thing’” while keeping in mind “how mediated interactions
with wildlife may come to shape the future of our planet and our
connection with it” [ 84]. Inasmuch as work has shown that the very
experience of e.g., embodying animals within an immersive virtual
environment potentiates one’s involvement with nature, we should
not lose track of the value of fully embodied and direct contact
with nature [ 1]. If not alert to these possibilities, one might end
up contributing to the ‘environmental generational amnesia’ that
would inevitably result from subsequent generations fully replacing
the experience of nature with technology-mediated interactions
[53].
The previously identified tensions and design opportunities pre-
sented by LGs, as players co-author their playful narrative, are
varied — e.g., the need for, given their implied geographic dynam-
ics, LG to foster higher motivation in players or a sense of closureand reward within a story that is geographically dispersed [ 33].
When visiting heritage locations, aside from imparting knowledge
to visitors, LGs may facilitate the renewal or development of rela-
tionships with places, but this success is dependent on “the balance
of attention between the virtual and real (the story and the place)”
[67]. All these elements present tensions that must be considered
when implementing LGs for nature engagement. Many of these
issues may be solved by designing LGs that do not compromise the
players’ attention and potential immersion in a space by not re-
quiring the player to look at a screen while walking in the physical
location with which the LG is contingent [57].
These early ideas and directions shared here (Fig. 1) are but start-
ing points for caring technologies and LGs, and highlight the value
of developing technological solutions in the wild, complementing
direct contact with nature with added layers of technologically-
mediated content and meaning.
5.2 Understanding the role of technology — or
its absence — in natural environments
Moreover, these proposals and shared experiences also illuminate
the space where designs should be careful or should not go, ad-
dressing the ongoing debate within HCI regarding technology’s
role in natural environments: balancing the enhancement of out-
door experiences against the potential for diminished immersion
[96]. Considering the delicate balance of these ecosystems, we be-
came aware of creating interventions that not only lead to the visit
of such places, but also warn about it over exploitation and how
not visiting, or visiting as indicated, might be an act of care and
conservation in itself.
Following the suggestions put forward by Dorward et al. for
“well-implemented AR games” (building on Pokémon Go’s poten-
tial to increase engagement with real-world nature), we recognize
the possibility of reaching numerous and varied publics with AR
technologies such as LG, yet acknowledge the compromised needed
between true immersion in nature and the simultaneous utilization
of technology in nature [ 30]. As the necessity of the application
of non-anthropocentric approaches to human-centered design is
recognized, and concerns with care are placed center stage in the
interaction design space, we will come ever closer to living truly
collaborative relationships with our more-than-human planetary
companions [ 19,62]. Along these lines, we are committed to extend-
ing the reach of stories and lessons through alternative platforms
such as off-site digital media, museum installations, or educational
centers.
This approach not only ensures that a broader audience can
connect with, but learn and benefit from, Madeira’s natural and
cultural heritage, yet underscores our commitment to a thoughtful
and responsible engagement with technology. We thus ensure that
our interventions are sustainable and mindful of the ecological
sanctity of the site, nurturing a culture of empathy while cultivating
a deep, caring relationship between individuals and the natural
world.
90

5.3 Relational connections and multispecies
interactions
The research underscores the significance of fostering multispecies
interactions and a profound sense of belonging within the Levadas ’
ecosystem, urging interaction designers to approach their work
with empathy and a deep respect for all life forms. This aligns with
the ethos of Anthropocene feminist care and the human biophilic
drive to connect with nature [ 116], which emphasize relational
and contextual engagements with the environment, advocating for
interactions and technologies that bolster our connection to the
natural world without compromising its sanctity.
When one posits the human against the posthuman in LG design,
one must be mindful of questions ranging from the experience to
the nature of the relationship between player and narrative [ 7].
This fluidity and the liminal space it opens between player and
narrative, in the empathy that it may afford, may very well play in
favor of conservation, providing opportunities for successful nature
engagement as we propose with our design potentials.
As Key et al. remind us, “researchers have turned to care ethics
as a strategy to explicate and challenge dominant anthropocentric
forces from design. Care as a feminist practice is about attending
to what, how, and when things get caring attention and come to
matter and what, how, and when things don’t” [54].
In summary, our study highlights how, while the essence of the
Levada experience is rooted in the unique biodiversity and cultural
narratives of Madeira, the implementation of potential interactive
experiences is not confined to the geographical boundaries of the
site. Considering the delicate balance of these ecosystems, we are
committed to extending the reach of stories and lessons through al-
ternative platforms. This approach ensures that a broader audience
can connect with and learn from Madeira’s natural and cultural
heritage.
Our study ultimately paints a suggestive future for locative in-
terventions in natural heritage settings, calling for a shift towards
design approaches that are empathetic, inclusive, and ecologically
integrated, celebrating the interconnectedness of humans, technol-
ogy, and nature. By adopting these principles, designers can craft
locative HCI narratives that entertain and foster a deeper sense of
connection, appreciation, and stewardship for the natural world and
its myriad inhabitants, as exemplified by the Levadas of Madeira
Island.
6 CONCLUSION
In this article the authors report on the findings from a study of the
potentials for engagement with the natural heritage of the Madeira
UNESCO heritage sites of the Levada walks, highlighting the role of
locative gaming and HCI. Delving into the realm of posthumanist
HCI, this study invites practitioners and scholars to move beyond
human-centered design paradigms and embrace a more inclusive
and caring approach to natural heritage that recognizes the complex
interplay of humans and non-human actors. In line, the playful
potentials here identified underscore the opportunity to design
locative technologies that are engaging and imbue players with a
sense of empathy and responsibility towards conservation, while
keeping a focus on the challenge of balancing conservation needs
with the demands of tourism. Results from the study demonstratehow a holistic understanding of visitor experiences can inspire
the design of interactive technologies that foster meaningful and
sustainable interactions with the natural world. In doing so, we
point at potentials through which the HCI community may cultivate
a more harmonious, beyond utilitarian relationship with nature
— one that honors our shared history and mutual dependence,
enriching human-nature interactions while guiding us towards a
more sustainable and mindful engagement with the world around
us.
