Abstract This paper outlines a methodology for develop-
ing an agriculture ontology to extract relationships from texts 
using web-scraping techniques, Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The objective of 
the presented approach is to offer a deeper understanding of 
the connections among different concepts in the agriculture 
industry and enhance the decision-making processes. The 
proposed methodology comprises utilizing web-scraping 
techniques to gather text data pertaining to agriculture from 
sources that provide agri-related information. Subsequently, 
the gathered data is subjected to pre-processing utilizing 
NLP techniques in order to eliminate any extraneous or 
insignificant information. Then, a range of Machine-Learn-
ing and Deep Learning techniques, specifically Linear SVM, 
Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, are employed 
to derive significant insights from the pre-processed data. 
The ontology is constructed using Protégé through the identification of concepts and relationships derived from 
the extracted features using a rule-based methodology. The 
suggested approach was evaluated using a dataset consist-
ing of articles related to agriculture. The results showcased 
the effectiveness of the suggested approach in creating an 
agriculture ontology that accurately identifies connections 
between concepts. Paper introduces a novel approach to cre-
ating an agriculture ontology by employing web-scraping 
techniques, NLP, and AI to extract semantic relationships 
from textual data. The proposed approach has the poten-
tial to enhance decision-making processes in agriculture by 
providing insights into the interrelationships among various 
concepts. This methodology is highly valuable for research -
ers and professionals in the agriculture sector and it can also 
be utilized in other fields to derive semantic relationships 
from textual data.

1 Introduction
Ontology is a computer science field that organizes knowl-
edge. Soft computing establishes a precise and widely 
accepted understanding of a domain or subject. It also rep-
resents and organizes ambiguous data.[ 1]. Artificial intel -
ligence, NLP, and the semantic web use ontologies. They 
spread knowledge across systems and applications [2 , 3]. 
Ontologies allow machines to reason, infer, and make deci-
sions based on knowledge. They help represent and analyze 
incomplete, inconsistent, or uncertain knowledge. This is 
especially useful in AI, NLP, and the semantic web where 
data is often complex and difficult to express using math-
ematical models [4 ]. Ontologies contain concepts, classes, 
and objects and their relationships. Hierarchically, broader 
concepts are at the top and more specific concepts are at the 
bottom. Concept connections can be depicted as properties 
or attributes to set limits and regulations on their operation 
[5]. Ontologies help systems and applications share knowl-
edge. A shared ontology lets systems interpret and use infor -
mation meaningfully. This improves system and application 
interoperability and collaboration, enabling smarter, more 
adaptive systems.
The agriculture ontology focuses on the conceptualiza-
tion and categorization of agricultural knowledge, encom-
passing the terminology and relationships between various 
concepts in the field [6 –9]. The multidisciplinary approach 
incorporates knowledge from agriculture, computer science, 
and information science. It can improve agricultural system 
understanding and management. Big data on soil nutrient 
levels and crop growth is analyzed using ML/DL algorithms. These algorithms predict crop yields and nutrient needs [9 , 
10]. An agricultural ontology can include specialized knowl-
edge about crops, soil, weather, and other important factors 
in crop production. An ontology provides a systematic rep-
resentation of domain knowledge to help select and interpret 
sensors, improving sensor data accuracy.
An ontology serves as a conceptual framework that 
encompasses the constraints and interrelationships among 
various entities within a particular area of research. An 
increasingly popular method in the field of knowledge rep-
resentation is the development of domain-specific ontology. 
The field of agriculture generates a substantial amount of 
data, which can be acquired in the forms of spreadsheets, 
tables, and textual documents [11]. Unfortunately, the 
lack of sufficient data processing techniques has led to the 
underutilization of this data. The Indian agriculture sector 
is widely recognized as the primary industry of the country 
and is responsible for employing over 50% of the nation’s 
population [12]. Using cutting-edge technologies and inno-
vative practices can boost sector productivity. However, this 
requires a well-organized and methodical knowledge repre-
sentation. With an agricultural ontology, Indian farmers can 
easily find industry terms and concepts. It can also improve 
their communication and collaboration with other farmers. 
This knowledge can also help researchers and stakehold-
ers communicate. An agricultural ontology can help cre-
ate intelligent systems that give farmers weather and other 
crop-related data.
Indian farmers face many challenges using agricultural 
ontologies. One issue is the lack of a common language for 
terms and concepts. Communication breakdown and ambi-
guity can hinder their adoption of new agricultural methods. 
Failure to integrate diverse technologies and systems and 
lack of current information hinders new practices [13]. This 
hinders informed decision-making. An agricultural ontology 
Int. j. inf. tecnol.

can address these issues by creating a common lexicon that 
allows farmers to use terms and concepts and share infor -
mation and knowledge. It can also help create intelligent 
systems that make smart decisions. An agricultural ontology 
is needed to improve Indian agriculture. It improves farmers’ 
communication and collaboration. It can also provide timely 
crop and other information. This form of knowledge repre-
sentation must be developed and implemented for industry 
growth.
Despite the abundance of data, developing countries 
like India still rely on human experts and government poli-
cies for decision-making. Extracting agricultural terms is 
difficult due to data heterogeneity, format variations, and 
categorization. Farmers often use past experiences to deter -
mine crop cultivation methods, which can be risky. Thus, 
many farmers have crop-growing questions which can be 
solved by proposed approach. Rest of the paper is organized: 
Sect.  2 discusses Ontology literature, while Sect.  3 discusses 
methods used to achieve the goal. Sect. 4 covered feature 
extraction methods. AI-based modeling is covered in Sect. 5. 
Relationship extraction for ontology creation was shown in 
Sect.  6. Similarity indices are calculated in Sect.  7. Section-8 
describes ontology creation. Section-9 discusses outputs and 
results. Section-10 ends the paper and discusses future plans.

As agricultural knowledge grows and must be stored and 
managed, ontologies are becoming more important. This 
review summarizes the literature on ontologies in agricul-
ture and related fields. This text discusses the development 
and integration of these technologies in knowledge manage-
ment and soil classification. In recent years, ontology-based 
approaches have advanced in many fields.
Muñoz et al. proposed an approach based on ontology for 
efficient soil selection and classification [14]. Their work 
laid the foundation for understanding how ontologies can 
contribute to improving agricultural practices. Following 
this, S. Harish Venu et al. explored unsupervised domain 
ontology learning, which allowed for greater flexibility in 
ontology construction [15].
Several studies have furthered the development and 
understanding of agricultural ontologies. Jebaraj et al. con-
ducted an exploratory study on agriculture ontology from a 
global perspective [16]. Subsequently, Jonquet et al. demon-
strated the power of “unified metadata in ontology” reposi-
tories using “AgroPortal” as a case study [17]. Kaladzavi 
et al. proposed an ontology-based architecture for co-con-
struction of sociocultural knowledge systems [18], while 
Kaushik et al. explored automatic relationship extraction 
from “agricultural text” for “ontology construction” [19]. Deb et al. developed a framework for ontology learning from 
taxonomic data [20].
Agriculture ontology research has expanded to include 
knowledge graphs pertaining to crop pests and diseases. 
Xiaoxue et al. conducted a review and trend analysis of 
these knowledge graphs [21]. In the same year, Chukka-
palli et al. discussed about ontologies and AI systems for 
cooperative smart farming ecosystems were discussed [22]. 
Ghazal et al. introduced an “intelligent role-based access 
control model” and framework using semantic business roles 
in multi-domain environments [23]. Aydin et al. developed 
an ontology-based data acquisition model for agricultural 
open data platforms and implemented the “OWL2MVC” 
tool [24].
Drury et al. conducted a survey of semantic web technol-
ogy for agriculture, highlighting the importance of ontol-
ogy-based approaches in the field [25]. Tarus et al. reviewed 
“ontology-based recommender systems” for e-learning, a 
domain that shares similarities with agriculture in terms of 
knowledge dissemination [26]. Rajendran et al. designed an 
agricultural ontology based on “levy flight distributed opti-
mization” and “Naïve Bayes classifier” [27]. Zaman et al. 
presented an ontological structure for extracting data from 
diverse scientific sources [28], while Mughal et al. proposed 
an ontology-based semantic model for river flow and flood 
mitigation [29].
N. Kaur et al. [30] propose reformulating queries with a 
domain-specific ontology to improve semantic information 
retrieval. To improve information retrieval accuracy and rel-
evance, the authors suggest augmenting search queries with 
ontology. This work improves semantic search by incor -
porating domain-specific knowledge structures into query 
reformulation. A. Thukral et al. [31] used NLP, NER, and 
biomedical ontologies to improve clinical narrative knowl-
edge graphs. A method for extracting organized knowledge 
from unorganized clinical data improves healthcare appli-
cations. The study addresses the challenges of organizing 
narrative clinical text data to improve specialized healthcare 
analytics. A semantic knowledge graph is used to create a 
subject-based ontology by Ta et al. [32 ] An innovative ontol-
ogy creation method using semantic knowledge graphs is 
proposed. The study develops topic-specific ontologies to 
improve knowledge representation and organization across 
fields.

constrained ontology evolution in predictive mainte-
nance [33]. Mummigatti et al. developed a supervised

ture and related fields gaining popularity and progress. 
Researcher have studied ontology construction, acquisi-
tion, and implementation to develop smart, contextually-
aware solutions. This review highlights the importance of 
ontology-based methodologies in agriculture, providing 
valuable insights into current research and future direc-
tions. Continuing to study and integrate ontologies in 
agriculture should improve decision-making, knowledge 
management, and agricultural practices. The literature 
review emphasizes ontologies’ role in agricultural knowl-
edge management and consolidation. The text describes 
their use in various fields and discusses their potential to 
improve knowledge sharing and compatibility. This litera-
ture review suggests that ontology-based models could be 
used to create agricultural decision-making and knowledge 
management systems. The review highlighted the variety 
of methods and strategies used to develop and evaluate 
such systems..
3  Methodology
Agricultural practices are becoming increasingly complex 
and rely on various factors such as climate, soil, and crop 
varieties. Therefore, there is a need for a strong knowl-
edge management system. This paper presents a meth-
odology for constructing an agricultural ontology using 
web-scraped data and sophisticated Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques. Our goal is to utilize the 
abundant and ever-changing information found online to 
build a thorough and organized knowledge repository that 
empowers individuals involved in the agricultural indus-
try. The methodology consists of various distinct steps: 
data collection and preprocessing, feature extraction, 
knowledge representation, implementing DL and ontol-
ogy generation algorithm 1 express the agricultural ontol -
ogy development. This section provides an explanation 
for each stage, emphasizing the specific natural language 
processing techniques used and their importance in con-
structing a strong and informative agricultural ontology.

1 3
3.1  Dataset
Data are collected from various websites using web-scrap-
ping API “Scrapy”. Websites like “www. farmi ngind ia. in” 
[41], “www. krish ijagr  an. com” [42], “www. agrif  arming. in” 
[43] etc are used to get data based on Indian climate. Data 
are then converted to “.CSV” file for further processing. 
Here 22 various crops are taken in consideration namely 
“Bajra”, “Wheat”, “Rice”, “Tobacco” etc. Dataset are then 
categories under 4 categories 1= “Crop”, 2= “Soil Nutri-
ent”, 3= “Soil Type”, 4= “Season” for easier analysis and 
organization of the data for quick identify which category 
a particular piece of data falls under. Using standardized 
classification system, it helps to better understand relation-
ship between various categories of data and draw more 
meaningful insight from dataset (see Fig.  1).
3.2  Data normalization
Normalization requires multiple steps for accurate data 
extraction. Lowercase all text is one option. Next, remove 
all word gaps. This reduces data interference. After that, 
periods and punctuation are removed. Eliminating Unicode 
characters means removing rare symbols from the language. 
Substitutions replace contraction short forms with full-forms 
to improve text consistency and readability. Eliminating 
meaningless "Stopwords" from the text. Alphabet-free words 
are excluded. These processes are essential for a precise and 
meaningful agriculture ontology. Table  1 represents the pro -
cess of various data normalization methods.
3.3  Stemming and lemmatization
NLP uses "stemming" and "lemmatization" to derive word 
bases from text. Stemming removes letters to form a base 
word, while lemmatization reduces words to their dictionary 
form, the lemma. Lemmatization’s main benefit is creating 
semantically meaningful base words. This process consid -
ers word pronunciation and does not remove all letters. The 
development of an agricultural ontology uses "stemming" 
and "lemmatization" to extract relevant and significant data 
about the field’s diverse concepts and terminology. This 
method helps create a complete and accurate picture of the 
field’s complex relationships. Table  2 shows the difference 
between the processing of both techniques.

4.1  NLP and POS tagging
Text extraction requires POS tagging to extract sentence 
information. As shown in Table  3, it can classify and identify

speech parts for naming entity recognition. Language pro-
cessing relies on POS tagging to identify each word in sen-
tences. It helps machines understand sentence structure and 
make more accurate predictions.
The weighted terms derived from the regular expressions 
are based on the assumptions shown in Table  4. Noun is pre-
ferred over other words that satisfy similar regular expres-
sions. A verb is preferred over other terms that have similar 
regular expressions. High frequency words, on the other 
hand, are significant terms. The weights are increased for 
words that have multiple patterns when compared to those 
that only have single patterns.
4.2  Timex feature
NLP’s Timex feature extracts temporal expressions from 
text. This feature can be used to create an agriculture ontol-
ogy to identify time-related information in farming prac -
tices and crop growth documents (Tables  5, 6). Timex can 
improve agricultural efficiency by creating a comprehensive 
ontology to analyze and interpret farming data.
4.3  Analysing web‑scraped text with N‑grams
The three NLP concepts “Uni-gram”, “Bi-gram” and “Tri-
gram” used to analyze and process text. Uni-gram is one 
word, bi-gram is two, and tri-gram is three. An agriculture 
ontology can analyze the context and frequency of terms 
like crop name, season, soil nutrient, and crop type using 
these features. The ontology can represent domain relation-
ships and knowledge by categorizing and identifying these 
terms by frequency and co-occurrence, as shown in Figs.  2, 
3. Web scraping can collect a lot of text from agricultural 
websites. This creates an informative and complete agricul-
ture ontology.
4.4  Integration of the process
Input: “Rice cultivated during rabi season is also called 
as ?summer rice?. It is sown in the months of November to 
February and harvested during March to June. 9% of total 
rice crop is grown in this season.”
Output: rice cultivate rabi season also call summer rice

5.2.1  Random forest
An ensemble learning method known as Random Forest can 
be used for classification, regression, and other types of tasks. 
It accomplishes this by first constructing a large number of 
decision trees during the training phase, and then outputting 
the class that corresponds to the mode of the classes (during 
classification) or the mean prediction (during regression) of 
the individual trees as shown in Eq.  3.
where, Tb(x) = prediction of the b th “decision tree in the 
random forest for input” “ x ” and “B” is the number of trees 
present in the forest.
5.3  Deep learning algorithms
Deep learning models are a class of machine learning mod-
els that use multiple layers of artificial neural networks to 
learn complex patterns in data. Deep learning has been suc-
cessful in a variety of applications such as computer vision, 
natural language processing, and speech recognition.
5.3.1  LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture 
designed to remember long-term dependencies in sequential 
data. LSTM consist of memory cells that can forget or remem-
ber information selectively. This allows LSTM to learn pat-
terns in sequences of data such as natural language sentences 
or time series data Eqs.  4–10 represent input gate, cell state, 
output gate and predicted probability.

(9) ht=ot∗tanh(Ct)The predicted probability distribution:
The model is trained by minimizing a loss function such 
as cross-entropy between the predicted probability distribu-
tion and the true label of the crop type, using backpropaga-
tion through time (BPTT) algorithm.
5.3.2  GRU 
Similar to LSTM, but with fewer parameters, Gated Recur -
rent Units (GRU) are a type of RNN architecture. GRU also 
use gating mechanisms to forget or remember information 
selectively in memory cells. GRU are easier and quicker to 
train than LSTM making them useful for NLP.
Let X = x1,x2,…..xn be the input sequence of soil nutri-
ent measurements, and Y = y1,y2,…..yn be the correspond-
ing crop types. The GRU model consists of a single GRU 
network that takes the input sequence X as input and gener -
ates a sequence of hidden states H = h1,h2,…..hn; as shown 
in Eqs.  11–15.

The predicted probability distribution:
where σ = “ sigmoid function”, tanh = “hyperbolic tan-
gent function”, * →  “element-wise multiplication”, W= 
“Weight” and b=”bias matrices/vectors”.
5.3.3  Bi-GRU 
Bidirectional GRUs (Bi-GRU) are a variation of GRUs that 
process sequential data in both directions, similar to Bi-
LSTM. Bi-GRUs have two GRU layers, one which processes 
data in the forward direction and the other in the reverse 
direction. Let X = x1,x2,…..xn be the input sequence of 
soil nutrient measurements, and Y = y1,y2,…..yn be the 
corresponding crop types. The Bi-GRU model consists of 
two GRU networks, one processing the input sequence in (10) yt=softmax (Wyht+by)

the reverse direction and the other in the forward direc-
tion. The outputs of both networks are concatenated and fed 
into a dense layer to make the final prediction as shown in 
Eqs.  16–20.
The forward GRU network takes the input sequence X 
as input and generates a sequence of hidden states Hf=hf1 , 
hf2,…..hfn;
where GRUf = forward GRU function.
The reverse GRU network takes the input sequence X in 
reverse order and generates a sequence of hidden states
where GRUb = backward GRU function.
The final prediction is obtained by concatenating the for -
ward and backward hidden states at each time step and feeding 
them into a dense layer:
where [;] denotes the concatenation operation,  Wh = 
“Weight matrix”, b = “bias vector”.
5.3.4  Bi-LSTM
Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) is a modified version of 
LSTM that analyzes sequential data in both forward and back -
ward directions. Bi-LSTM consists of two LSTM layers, one 
for processing data in the forward direction and another for 
processing data in the backward direction. Bi-LSTM have the 
ability to capture information from both the past and the future 
in a sequence, which makes them valuable in NLP.
Let X = x1,x2,…..xn be the input sequence of soil nutrient 
measurements, and Y = y1,y2,…..yn  be the corresponding 
crop types. Bi-LSTM uses two LSTM networks, one forward 
and one reverse, to process the input sequence. Combining 
both networks’ results into a dense layer yields the final predic-
tion. Hf = hf1,hf2,……hfn as depicted in Eqs.  21–24.
where LSTMf  is the forward LSTM function.
The reverse LSTM network takes the input sequence X 
in reverse order and generates a sequence of hidden states

(17) Hb=hb1,hb2,…..hbn

(20) yi=softmax/parenleft.s1Whhi+b/parenright.s1
(21) hﬁ=LSTMf/parenleft.s1xi,hf,i−1/parenright.s1where LSTMb  is the backward LSTM function.
The final prediction is obtained by concatenating the for -
ward and backward hidden states at each time step and feed-
ing them into a dense layer:
where [;] denotes the concatenation operation, Wh=εw 
eightmatrix”,  b = “bias vector”.
6  Relationship extraction
Relationship extraction is essential to NLP workflows. It 
helps identify and represent textual concept relationships. 
An agricultural ontology shows how fertilizers and crops are 
related. Table  8 shows how NLP help organize and represent 
agricultural industry knowledge by identifying relationships 
between entities. Relationship extraction can help identify 
the correlation between ideal crop growth conditions and 
fertilizer quantity.(22) hbi=LSTMb/parenleft.s1xn−i+1 ,hb,i+1/parenright.s1

7  Similarity index calculation
NLP relies on the similarity index to find similarities 
between textual pieces. An agricultural ontology, a collec-
tion of related concepts and terms, is built using it. NLP uses 
word embedding and word similarity to measure text simi-
larity. Word embedding vectorizes words. These methods 
can be used in agriculture to compare concepts and terms. 
The agricultural term relevance is determined by a high 
word similarity index score. Table  9 shows how "Euclidean 
similarity" and "Cosine similarity" are used to gather data 
to improve agricultural knowledge.
7.1  Euclidean similarity
Euclidean similarity is a quantitative measure that math-
ematically assesses the degree of similarity between two 
vectors. Euclidean similarity is employed in the agricultural 
domain to quantify the resemblance between various agri-
cultural elements, including crop varieties, soil composi-
tions, and fertilizers. The Euclidean similarity between two 
vectors can be computed using the following formula, as 
depicted in Eq.  25:
where A and B = “vectors (statements) being compared”, 
n= “no. of dimensions in the vectors”.
7.2  Cosine similarity
Cosine similarity is employed metric for quantifying the 
similarity between two vectors. It is especially advantageous (25) Euclidean Similarity (A,B)=/uni221A.t/uni221A.x/uni221A.x/uni221A.s4n/uni2211.s1
i−1(Ai−Bi)2in NLP tasks for measuring the similarity between state-
ments and categorizing text. Cosine similarity quantifies the 
cosine of the angle formed by two vectors, which represent 
the documents or texts. The cosine similarity ranges from 
– 1 to 1. A value of 1 signifies that the two vectors are iden-
tical, 0 indicates no similarity, and – 1 indicates complete 
dissimilarity between the two vectors. Cosine similarity is 
a useful tool in relationship extraction as it allows for the 
identification of the similarity between two sentences. If the 
cosine similarity between two sentences is high, it indicates 
that they are likely to be conveying a similar relationship, 
as depicted in Eq.  26.
where s1.s2 = “dot product of vectors s1ands2 ”, ||s1 || and || s2 || 
“norms of vectors s1ands2 respectively”. Sample statements 
are show in statements 1 to 4.
Statement-1: “Wheat grows well in well-drained loamy 
soil with good organic matter content”.
Statement-2: “Black soil is ideal for wheat cultivation as 
it is rich in nutrients and retains moisture for a long time”.
Statement-3: “Wheat requires a cool climate with moder -
ate rainfall”.
Statement-4: “Wheat is sown in October to November and 
harvested in March to April”.
8  Ontology creation
The software tool “Protégé” is utilized for the creation and 
administration of intricate agricultural knowledge bases. Its 
purpose is to generate and oversee knowledge bases that 
adhere to standardized properties, classes, and relation-
ships. This facilitates comprehension and implementation (26)Cosine similarity (s1,s2)=s1.s2

of knowledge within their respective domain. Protégé is 
utilized for the purpose of collaborating and reutilizing the 
knowledge base, rendering it an optimal tool for the devel-
opment and management of intricate agricultural ontology 
systems. To create an ontology for agriculture, it is impor -
tant to follow a systematic process, as depicted in Fig.  5, to 
ensure that the ontology is informative and well-structured.
8.1  Creating various class hierarchy and Data property 
for agriculture ontology
The “Protégé” software is employed to establish a class 
hierarchy and data property hierarchy for the agriculture 
ontology, which was generated through diverse techniques 
including web scraping, NLP and AI. The class hierar -
chy is a graphical depiction of the fundamental concepts 
that are frequently employed in the field of agriculture. 
Users are able to arrange and classify them within the 
ontology. The data property hierarchy is employed to 
depict the diverse attributes or traits of a class within an 
ontology. These may encompass the title, explanation, or attributes of the class as depicted in Figs.  6, 7a. It aids 
in delineating the attributes and qualities of the concepts 
within the ontology. The Protégé software enables users 
to create and oversee a diverse range of classes and data 
properties using a graphical interface. It allows to define 
relationships between these properties and classes. This 
process can help them develop effective decision-making 
systems and improve the efficiency of their operations. The 
development of the data property and class hierarchies in 
Protégé is very important in order to create an agricultural 
ontology. These components provide a framework for cat-
egorizing and organizing the various concepts within the 
framework. The resulting ontology will be used to support 
the decisions made in the field of agriculture.

focuses on the use of various models, including ML/DL 
algorithms, as well as evaluation metrics, confusion matrix 
and accuracy loss graphs.
9.1  Confusion matrix
The classification capabilities of the proposed models were 
presented in an easy-to-follow and comprehensive manner 
through the utilization of the confusion matrix as shown in 
Fig. 8. The number of classifications displayed in the table indicated the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The 
matrix helped us identify the weaknesses and strengths of 
each proposed model. This allowed us to select the most 
suitable one for semantic extraction and to understand the 
areas where we need to improve.
9.2  Agriculture ontology visualization
The creation of an agricultural ontology is accomplished 
through a hierarchical structure, which included attrib-
utes, entities, and relationships as shown in Fig.  9. This

represented the knowledge of the domain and allowed 
extraction of semantic connections within the text, which 
improved the way researchers can retrieve and understand 
agricultural data.
9.3  Evaluation metrices
The ontology specification generated offered a thorough 
and precise depiction of the relationships and concepts 
within the agricultural field. The construction process fol-
lows a rule-based approach, which includes identifying 
the concepts and relationships of the extracted features. Tables  10, 11 and Figs.  10, 11 depict the various results

the agricultural field. The construction process follows a 
rule-based approach, which entails identifying the concepts 
and relationships of the extracted features. Figures  12, 13, 
and 14 depict the agriculture ontology generated.
The proposed method has several novel features. The data 
source uses web-scraped text to collect diverse and extensive 
information beyond traditional agricultural sources. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques make it stand out for 
pre-processing, ensuring a more sophisticated and nuanced 
agricultural text analysis. The methodology uses AI mod-
els like SVM, Random Forest, CNN, and LSTM for feature 
extraction, making it more robust and advanced than existed 
ontology-based methods [9 , 27]. Protégé’s rule-based ontology 
construction distinguishes it from other models. The proposed

work focuses on semantic relationship extraction and insights 
into connections, offering a unique perspective on agricultural 
information. The novel approach combines web-scraping, 
NLP, and AI for relationship extraction with rule-based ontol-
ogy construction. This method increases applicability beyond 
agriculture to text data with semantic relationships.10  Conclusion and future scope
The paper proposes a novel ontology construction method 
for agricultural text relationships. DL, NLP and web-based 
methods are used. The method successfully extracts impor -
tant information across concepts. The resulting ontology 
can benefit agricultural professionals and researchers. The 
proposed method is adaptable to finance, healthcare, and 
law, providing many applications. It can also be improved

with diverse external sources and decision support sys-
tems. Integrating new avenues improves the suggested 
method. It will generate a more accurate and relevant 
ontology. In NLP and agriculture, the proposed ontol-
ogy method for extracting relationships from agricultural 
texts is a breakthrough. It helps researchers and decision-
makers make informed sector decisions. This approach 
could transform multi-domain decision-making. It can pro-
vide more accurate and comprehensive knowledge to help 
users make informed decisions. In multilingual countries, 
expanding the proposed approach to multiple languages 
would make it more relevant. Developing language models 
for the NLP pipeline and translating are ways to do this. 
To understand agriculture’s many aspects, current decision 
support systems can use the suggested methodology. The 
ontology can be used to create prognostic instruments for 
agricultural production decision support systems to pro-
vide timely industry insights.
