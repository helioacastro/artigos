With its focus on the species level of the Anthropos, there is growing concern that 
the Anthropocene analytic lacks the conceptual nuance needed to grapple with 
the unevenly distributed harms and responsibilities tied up with issues of biodi-
versity loss, global warming, and land use change. Conceptual variants like the 
patchy Anthropocene have been proposed to better capture the justice implica-
tions of these socio-ecological crises, directing attention to their spatially ubiqui-
tous yet context-specific character. The figure of the plantation has come to play 
an important role in this scholarship due to the contribution intensive agriculture 
had made to these interlinking crises. Through empirical study of the regenera-
tive agricultural movement, this paper reflects on how regenerative farmers use 
different sites (fields, soils, livestock stomachs) to apprehend their agro-ethical 
responsibilities to more-than-human actors both near to and far from the land-
scapes they manage. Our aims here are two-fold. First, we provide a more affirm-
ative account of agricultural management than is currently offered by plantation 
farming: a model of food production that is not just ‘in’ the Anthropocene, but 
‘for’ it. Second, we contribute to ongoing discussions unfolding in the social sci-
ences around the tools needed to conceptualise the interlinking spatial and jus-
tice aspects of the Anthropocene transition. By bringing the patchy analytic into 
conversation with more established geographic writing on scale, volume, and 
horizontal connections, we show the merit of juxtaposing multiple models of 
spatial relation as a way of gaining ethical and conceptual traction on complex 
socio-ecological issues. We argue that the ‘polymorphic’ spatial imaginaries of re-
generative agriculturalists can offer some guidance on the tools needed to attend 
to the specificity of local Anthropocene outcomes in relation to socio-ecological 
forces actuating the world at much greater spatio-temporal scales.

1 | INTRODUCTION
We are moving fast into the Anthropocene and conventional, intensive agriculture is one of its main drivers (Willett 
et al.,  2019, p. 244). While this model has led to vast increases in food production, there are growing concerns about its en-
vironmental, social, and political ills. These include the ecological simplification caused by deforestation and monocul-
ture, climate change, zoonotic diseases, and the erasure of smallholder land ownership and indigenous and vernacular 
knowledge systems. Although the Anthropocene framing has assisted in the analysis of these problems, there is concern 
about the concept's explanatory power and critical potential (Haraway,  2015). Critics suggest that the focus it places 
on the species level of the Anthropos makes it ill equipped to map the uneven geographies of responsibility for climate 
change and biodiversity loss, particularly as their violent outcomes are distributed along axes of socio-economic status, 
gender, and race (Malm & Hornborg, 2014).
In light of these criticisms, the anthropologist Anna Tsing and her colleagues offer the concept of the ‘patchy 
Anthropocene’ (Tsing et al.,  2019) as part of a wider project aiming to spatialise the Anthropocene transition (Tsing 
et al.,  2021). Their intervention is driven by a recognition of the links between space and multispecies justice. They argue 
that without analysing the spatially ubiquitous yet context-specific character of the Anthropocene, scholars will remain 
‘naively beholden to its unitary pretensions’ (Tsing et al.,  2019, p. 190). Scholars have begun to deploy the concept of 
the patchy Anthropocene, alongside other spatiality sensitive alternatives like the Plantationocene, to critically examine 
the negative impacts of intensive agricultural systems that rely on the simplification, rationalisation, and exploitation 
of ecologies and societies (Barua,  2023; Chao,  2021). This literature argues that the plantation is founded on a parochial 
spatio-temporal logic, and that its pursuit of accumulation has generated harmful socio-ecological outcomes in the form 
of climate change, social inequality, and biodiversity loss.
In this paper we develop this move to spatialise the Anthropocene, but offer a more affirmative account of agricul-
tural production. We focus on the regenerative agriculture movement that is emerging across the UK, the USA, Europe, 
Australia, and New Zealand. Regenerative agriculture promotes the salutary role of agriculture as a means to sequester 
carbon, improve soil health and biodiversity, and deliver a renewed contract for peaceable multispecies relations. The 
promises made in the name of regenerative agriculture figure as a direct response to the problems of the plantation and 
the diagnosis of the Anthropocene ‘Great Acceleration’. While regenerative agriculturalists emphasise the need to attend 
to the context-specific ecological behaviours of the landscapes they manage, the principles they follow have been devel-
oped to attend to global issues of warming, biodiversity loss, and land use change (Gordon et al.,  2022). Owing to this 
local–global, specific–structural, here–everywhere engagement, we cautiously present these farmers as model citizens 
for the patchy Anthropocene – those with an approach to food production not just ‘in’ the Anthropocene, but ‘for’ it 
(Maye et al., 2022).
To make the case, we focus on three spatial imaginaries that are common elements of the regenerative ‘mindscape’ 
(Gordon et al.,  2022). These imaginaries configure how our farmers connect local managerial and ethical responsibilities 
to planetary-scale socio-ecological issues. Our aims in presenting the spatial strategies of these farmers are two-fold. 
First, we document some of the principles and practices we believe are needed for a model of food production fit for the 
patchy Anthropocene. Second, we contribute to discussions unfolding in geography and anthropology around the con-
ceptual tools needed to account for the spatial complexities of the Anthropocene. While we rally behind attempts being 
made to spatialise the Anthropocene, we believe more work needs to be done to ensure the patchy Anthropocene analytic 
is up to the task.
We argue that both of these goals require a more sophisticated conceptual grammar of spatial relations than is currently 
offered in the writing on the patchy Anthropocene. To this end, we draw on established human geography scholarship 
on space and scale to describe the manner in which regenerative practitioners invoke (i) vertically nested frameworks, 
(ii) horizontal systems of networked connection, and (iii) volumetric models of three-dimensional space to guide their 
practice. We read these spatial imaginaries out of the strategies of regenerative agriculturalists as a way of writing them 
into the patchy Anthropocene analytic. We focus on three different sites – the field, the stomach, and the soil – to illustrate 
how these imaginaries work in practice. We explore how regenerative agriculturalists juxtapose these various imaginaries 
into a ‘polymorphic’ (Jessop et al.,  2008) approach to spatial relations. We show how this allows them to see global issues 
like climate change and biodiversity loss in the specific farmed landscapes they manage, and to situate the landscapes 
they manage as part of the solution to those same issues.
In the next section, we provide an overview of the patchy Anthropocene concept. We then introduce geographical 
literatures on space and scale and weave them into the patchy analytic. In the two following sections, we present the 
regenerative agricultural movement, and our methods for data capture and analysis. The subsequent three-part analysis

traces the spatial imaginaries at work in the regenerative agricultural model, along with the farm management practices 
and landscapes they are producing. In conclusion, we reflect on the implications of our analysis for conceiving of the 
geographies of food production and farm management ‘for’ the patchy Anthropocene (Maye et al., 2022).
1.1 | The patchy Anthropocene and the plantation
Tsing and colleagues develop the concept of the patchy Anthropocene from analyses of plantation agriculture. They 
suggest that the plantation model has provided both intellectual inspiration and an economic engine for environmen-
tal destruction, ecological simplification, and unequal economic development since taking root, most significantly, in 
the projects of European empire (Davis et al.,  2019). They focus their analysis on the twin processes of what they term 
‘modular simplification’ and ‘feral proliferation’. In the former, ecologies are simplified, rationalised, accelerated, and 
then replicated in the globalisation of the plantation model. In the latter, simplification leads to blowback, generating an 
unexpected and pathological abundance of pests, endowed with an ability to move along the vectors of globalisation with 
violent outcomes for the lives they entangle (Giraud et al.,  2019). Proliferation is exemplified in a host of plant pathogens, 
invasive species, and zoonotic diseases that spill over from industrial forests, plantations, and factory farms (Hinchliffe 
et al., 2016).
Under the plantation rationale, the lives whose growth is indexed to accumulation (like crops and livestock animals) 
are nurtured, while those with less easily traced financial benefits are killed or removed (Tsing,  2017). The plantation 
is indivisible from racialised hierarchies of control, accumulation, and labour (Davis et al.,  2019) and it produces in-
jurious outcomes for both the other-than-human lives on the plantation and the human communities proximate to it 
(Chao,  2021). The managerial approach to the plantation has a particular set of spatial characteristics. The spatial ex -
tent of the plantation is expanded outwards as the complexity of the relations it contains are reduced, while the hikes 
in output this rationalisation helps generate spatially separate the periphery (where the socio-ecological harms tied up 
with intensive cultivation are concentrated) from the core (which enjoys the benefits of accumulation and none of the 
violence of production) (Wolford, 2021).
Tsing and colleagues argue that the processes of ecological simplification and feral proliferations are tightly coupled 
within specific landscapes, and that their healthy or harmful outcomes are rooted in place and visited on the more-than-
humans who dwell there (Tsing et al.,  2019). They call on scholars to pay close attention to the spaces within which sim-
plifications and proliferations unfold. To do this, Tsing and colleagues draw on the science of landscape ecology and the 
study of landscape structures and the patches of which they are composed. They define a landscape as a ‘unit of hetero -
geneity whose components – at any scale – are patches’ (Tsing et al.,  2019, p. s188). Landscape structures are aggregations 
of patches, which are always coming into being, iteratively produced through more-than-human activity. Agricultural 
landscapes are a perfect example. Although farmers choreograph ecologies of plants, animals, soils, pollinators, and 
water to produce desired financial and agronomic outcomes, vegetal and animal life just as often as not compromises 
their control.
They suggest that by learning how to ‘read’ (Brown,  2019) the complex socio-ecological histories of landscape struc-
tures and their constituent patches, along with the harms and benefits they produce, scholars can use individual case 
study sites as analytical gateways to reflect on their relationships with longer and larger dynamics of change. Such ‘arts 
of noticing’ (Tsing,  2015) can help scholars see in synthesis structural macro-scale processes and local, specific, and 
micro-scale events. This is the aspect of the patchy analytic we are most interested in here: the means and ambition to 
attend to the specificity of Anthropocene outcomes in relation to the socio-ecological forces actuating the world at much 
greater spatio-temporal scales.
This ambition is complicated by the very scale of the things being studied. Many of the socio-environmental crises at 
the heart of the Anthropocene (climate change, biodiversity loss, etc.) are so large and have such a complex set of drivers 
that they cannot be fully understood in single spatio-temporal contexts. Tsing and colleagues encourage scholars to use 
models as ‘thought experiments’ to come to know the character of large-scale socio-ecological changes to cultivate more 
peaceable ways of living on a damaged planet. They also warn of the siren call of models and the way they can supplant 
affective engagements with the more-than-human worlds they are designed to apprehend (see Swanson, 2019).
Tsing et al. (2019) are particularly interested in how multiple ‘systems as thought experiments’ can be juxtaposed to 
produce competing and/or complementary evaluations of landscape dynamics. They suggest that this approach helps 
gain more observational and analytical traction on landscape structures with multivalent character and multiple tempo -
ralities. They propose focusing on ecological simplifications, feral proliferations, landscape structure, landscape patches,

and systems as thought experiments to grapple with the ‘spatial and historical unevenness that hides in plain sight in the 
Anthropocene’ (Tsing et al., 2019, p. s190).
1.2 | An enhanced spatial grammar: vertical, horizontal, and volumetric models
The work of Tsing et al. offers us a good start, but we wager that the project to spatialise the Anthropocene would benefit 
from a deeper engagement with geographic scholarship on space and scale. The first potential stumbling block, we be-
lieve, relates to the risk of naturalising categories that are, in fact, products of social and political construction (Marston 
et al.,  2005). When studying ethnicity and nationhood, for example, if scholars use the ‘nation state’ as a given category, 
they risk legitimating nationalist sentiments that they might otherwise be looking to query (Moore,  2008). How can 
scholars use spatial categories in patchy Anthropocene-inspired work (particularly the landscape patches and structure 
Tsing and colleagues provide) without privileging their analytic significance, assuming things about their spatial quali-
ties, or ‘reifying’ their ontological status (MacKinnon,  2011)?
Adam Moore suggests that the root of the issue lies in the ‘unreflexive conflation of scale as an everyday category of 
practice with [the] treatment of scale as a substantial category of analysis’ (Moore,  2008, p. 207). That is, a slippage be -
tween the usage of spatial units as a set of experience-distant ontological groupings that academics deploy to understand 
the worlds they are studying (categories of analysis), and their usage as a set of epistemological heuristics that are used by 
social actors to organise their behaviour and which go on to have material impacts in the world (categories of practice). 
He argues that confusion with these terms is creating a literature inattentive to the convergence between research design 
and findings. Using the spatial category of the ‘nation state’ in critical study will, to return to the above example, produce 
research attuned to the significance of the nation state, even though notions of nationhood are historically, topographi-
cally, and socially contingent.
What does this mean for the patchy Anthropocene and its application in social science research? We argue that it ne -
cessitates a commitment to using inductive rather than pre-determined spatial categories. In our study, we allowed the 
spatial frames used by our participants to emerge through interviews and over successive rounds of inductive, grounded 
theory style coding (Moghaddam,  2006). We focused on the intellectual activities involved in the construction of spatial 
categories and the material outcomes produced through the enactment of those frames. This approach forced us, as 
scholars, to grapple with the epistemological (categories of practice) not ontological (categories of analysis) character 
of spatial categories in our efforts to spatialise the Anthropocene. The landscape patches and structures in the patchy 
Anthropocene might be approached with similar analytic caution. They are not pre-determined spatial units – and schol-
ars using the patchy concept need to attend to the reasons why actors divide complex landscapes into constituent patches 
in the way they do every bit as much as they must attend to the biophysical, morphological, and ecological qualities of 
the places being studied.
A recognition of the epistemological character of spatial and scalar categories need not entail their wholesale aban-
donment (cf. Marston et al.,  2005). Indeed, the patchy Anthropocene requires a sophisticated conceptual grammar to 
properly study the uneven spatial distributions of the harms, benefits, and responsibilities of contemporary socio-ecolog -
ical crisis. In the empirical analysis that follows, we describe three (epistemological) spatial imaginaries that are used in 
the regenerative model. They include vertically nested systems, horizontally networked connections, and volumetrically 
deep approaches to space. The character and consequences of these three spatial imaginaries have been described in the 
literature.
The description offered by Taylor (1982) of vertically nested global, national and city scales has been hugely influen-
tial. Grounded in materialist political economy, work using this spatial imaginary has revealed how uneven economic 
outcomes emerge from the flows and interactions of capital between groupings at different levels in a vertically arranged 
hierarchy (Smith, 1990). This work initiated thinking on nested scales, in which ‘different activities are organized at dif-
ferent scales covering the same places’ (Collinge, 2006, p. 244).
Geographical interest has shifted to frameworks of networked horizontal connection. These foreground the link -
ages that conjoin related activities in distant locations (Collinge,  2006). As Leitner argues: ‘whereas the spatiality of 
a politics of scale is associated with vertical relations among nested territorially defined political entities … networks 
span space rather than covering it, transgressing the boundaries that separate and define these political entities’ 
(Leitner,  2004, p. 237). Scholars have been drawn towards such frameworks to account for the connections that have 
come to define contemporary economic and social life: commodity chains, agricultural supply and demand, labour 
migration, environmental governance, plastic pollution, governance structures of multinational corporations, and so

on. These vectors traverse the globe, link distant actors, activities, and outcomes, and make complex rhizomatic webs 
of causal connection.
More recently there has also been a ‘volumetric turn’ in geography to address concerns over an excessive focus on 
two-dimensional surfaces (Billé,  2017). This shift is linked to a more general material turn, focusing on the stuff of life 
which, by its nature, exists across three rather than two spatial dimensions (Steinberg & Peters,  2015). In our study, we 
go beyond the technocratic gaze that has been ‘hard to escape’ (Adey,  2013, p. 53) in scholarly accounts of three-dimen-
sional space by documenting the volumetric imaginaries used by non-hegemonic actors to guide their sustainable farm 
management strategies.
We use the term spatial as a catch-all to refer to the manner in which spaces relate to one another, and the way things 
happen within them. We allow the term to accommodate all of the vertically arranged, horizontally connected, and volu-
metrically deep framings used in this paper. We append to this the term imaginary to emphasise that we are dealing with 
epistemological (not ontological) heuristics that our research participants use to structure their subjectivities and guide 
their actions.
Rather than seek out a single spatial theory of everything, Jessop et al. (2008) recommend scholars embrace a poly -
morphic account of relations that ‘emphasizes the importance of contradictions, conflicts, dilemmas, marginalization, 
exclusion, and volatility, at once within and among each of these sociospatial forms’ (2008, p. 394). We agree that such 
an approach is needed to apprehend complex socio-ecological phenomenon with multivalent spatial connections and 
manifold temporalities. Such ‘planetary social thought’ (Clark & Szerszynski,  2020) is needed to situate human activity 
‘within the story of a planet that is evolving and organizing itself’ across timescales and spatial planes, both big and small 
(Szerszynski,  2022, p. 194). As we discuss in the final section of the paper, this polymorphic spatial approach also has 
good fit with the conceptual underpinnings and normative ambitions of the patchy Anthropocene, and is a key part of 
the strategy that allows regenerative practitioners to grapple with global socio-ecological issues through the management 
of specific farmed landscapes.
1.3 | Regenerative agriculture
Although the notion of agricultural regeneration has been around for some time, its ascent into the food mainstream over 
the last 10 years has been dizzying. Regenerative agriculture now boasts dedicated agricultural fairs, peer-to-peer learn-
ing networks, and consumer-facing food labels. A review of the movement's history and recent emergence is outside the 
scope of this paper, and so we direct readers to Newton et al. (2020) for a more comprehensive account. In this section, 
we instead focus on the aspects of regenerative agriculture that have a direct bearing on the way its practitioners concep-
tualise the spatial aspects of farm management.
The regenerative model is geared towards the revitalisation of the ecosystems on which agricultural production relies, 
particularly soils (Schreefel et al.,  2020). Its key principles are captured in Figure  1. Farmers use ‘no-till’ techniques (in which 
seeds are drilled into the topsoil) rather than ploughing, and they keep the soil covered by vegetation with cover or catch 
crops (plants like vetch and clover that are grown in between arable cash crops that can themselves be grazed by livestock 
animals). These practices are designed to allow soil structure to develop and complex and functional ecologies to flourish.
Livestock animals play an important – though not ubiquitous (Newton et al.,  2020) – part in regenerative soil health 
strategies (Gosnell et al.,  2020). Through their manure and browsing habits, ruminants cycle nutrients around the farm, 
reduce reliance on synthetic inputs of fertilisers, and create complex, carbon-rich soil ecologies. Livestock integration in 
Figure  1 refers to the cycling of grazing and cropping land use. The aim being to improve soil health and fertility, and 
to install diverse agroecosystems of which grazing ruminants are seen to be an important part. The term ‘diversity’ in 
Figure  1 relates both to the diversity of agricultural land use and the ecological diversity on the farm more generally. Crop 
diversification strategies move away from common minimally diverse rotations of wheat, barley, and oilseed rape towards 
longer and more elaborate rotations including peas, beans, oats, grasses, and fodder crops (Cusworth et al.,  2021a, 2021b).
2 | METHODS
The paper draws on 42 interviews with English farmers who identified as being, or in the process of becoming, regenera-
tive. Their farms ranged in size from 80 ha to 10,000 ha. The research sample represents a range of direct to consumer, 
part-time, and ‘hobby farmer’ business models, all the way up to large, commercial units that employed several full-time

staff and who sold their produce through agricultural commodity markets. In addition to these interviews, we also at-
tended four farm events being run by and/or for regenerative farmers, and spoke with experts from various extension 
services and agricultural research stations. This latter group, who were spoken to late on in the data collection process, 
added a level of strategic oversight to our findings. We used their expertise to help corroborate the input we had from our 
farming cohort. Interviews were a mix of 16 telephone and 26 in-person conversations.
Interviews were sourced initially with pre-existing contacts and, thereafter, through snowball sampling. The world 
of regenerative agriculture is well networked and practitioners were forthcoming with requests for interviews, farm vis -
its, and recommendations for other potential interviewees. Initial contact with participants explained the nature of the 
research. Follow-up emails provided a more detailed information sheet that had been vetted by the University's ethics 
board. This specified that the interviews would be recorded and that the participants’ words, with permission, might be 
used in future publications. Virtually all agreed to having their name attached to their words. In response to a small num-
ber of requests, we changed the name of a few interviewees for anonymisation purposes.
It is worth noting that the notion of ‘regenerative agriculture’ is going through a period of rapid growth, change, and 
differentiation. Many large agri-food businesses, along with policy makers from the FAO, the UK, Europe, and the USA, 
are weaving regenerative principles into their environmental and agricultural strategies. As a result, its origins as an en-
dogenous farmer-led movement are being complicated by the arrival of powerful political and commercial interests. The 
version of regenerative agriculture we are documenting here comes from farmers developing and applying regenerative 
farm practices and advocating for the broader adoption of regenerative principles across the farming community.
We coded our data inductively, following a grounded theory approach to social science research involving successive 
rounds of coding and analysis (Moghaddam,  2006). The inductive emergence of the spatial imaginaries we describe are 
central to the way we navigate the risk of ‘reifying’ spatial and scalar terms that we outlined above. We also use a series 
of diagrams and photos to represent the regenerative spatial imaginaries we identified. The graphics were developed in 
collaboration with Vivien Martineau, an artist who works within the world of alternative food networks. The photos 
were taken by Alexander Turner and permission to use them here was obtained from both the photographer and the 
individuals captured.
2.1 | The spatial imaginaries of regenerative agriculture
Our analysis explores three spatial imaginaries, which we illustrate with reference to three sites. These sites are central 
to the practice of regenerative agriculture and we feel are most indicative of the imaginaries we want to convey: (1) the 
vertically nested scaffolding that links the molecular to the field to the farm; (2) the horizontally networked connections FIGURE 1 The five principles of regenerative agriculture, taken from Groundswell, the organisation that runs the largest annual 
regenerative agriculture conference in the UK.

known through the stomachs of livestock animals; and (3) the volumetric considerations manifest in the regenerative 
valorisation of soil.
2.2 | Vertically nested scales and agricultural fields
The real shame of a brown [tilled] field is that it is a chunk of solar energy that is not being harvested by 
photosynthesis. 
Tim May, 1,000 ha mixed livestock arable farming
If you are growing cover crops you might just as well graze it. Then you are starting that nutrient cycling at 
a time when you want to be cycling nutrients. 
George Hosier, 650 ha mixed livestock arable farming
The production of food is, from the perspective of these regenerative farmers, a relatively simple project. There is the 
energy that the sun provides, and it is either harvested or not via the process of photosynthesis. There are nutrients that 
are either incorporated during the plant's growth phase or lost to run off or atmospheric breakdown. The agricultural 
implications of these biophysical systems must be observed to farm well: crops must be in the ground to harness the sun's 
energy, and the field must be managed in such a way that nutrients and water are available when they are needed.
Our farmers explained that fields were the smallest modular unit they use to organise their regenerative strategies: 
‘patches’ in patchy Anthropocene parlance that accommodate one particular agricultural land use at any one time, 
and that are bounded by field margins like rivers, hedgerows, and ditches. They are the sites at which their under -
standings of the microscopic dynamics of energy, water, and nutrients are put to work. In some instances, diversity 
within a field is pursued to create synergistic relations between different plant types. The establishment of mixed 
grazing swards and arable under-sowing, seen in Figure  2, are good examples. More commonly, though, fields are 
taken as the compositional units out of which heterogeneous farmed landscape structures are assembled. They oper -
ate as the focal point in a vertically arranged, nested, spatial imaginary. Standing in a field, farmers can look down the 
hierarchy to reflect on how the foundational biophysical processes involving energy, water, nutrients, and so on drive

ecological behaviours and agronomic outcomes. From the field, they can also look up to think about the constraints 
of farm-level regenerative governance: how to run a financially viable unit, how to ensure its agroecological viabil-
ity in the long term, and how to sustain or improve farm productivity. Per the ecological model of patch dynamics, 
the level of process (the field) is understood in relation to the level above it (the farm), which provides top-down 
constraints; while the level below provides the fundamental mechanisms dictating exchanges and outcomes (Wu & 
Loucks, 1995).
Although we complicate the two-dimensional implications of this imaginary later on, different land uses are ap -
plied onto and across fields as a way of generating farm-scale regenerative strategies that encompass the farm's total 
areal coverage, while field-level strategies are generated from understandings of relevant microscopic processes. In 
RA, the principle of enterprise stacking functions as a simplified ecological and economic heuristic that can be called 
on when jumping between the microscopic, field, and farm levels on this vertical hierarchy. The term relates to the 
way different agricultural ventures can be accommodated in a farm unit and cycled around different fields over time 
to create a resilient farm business (for discussion on the financial rationale for the adoption of regenerative practices, 
see Cusworth et al.,  2021a; Jaworski et al.,  2023) and a diverse agroecological system. This approach allows farmers 
to scale up knowledge about how water drains through the soils, which crop types give and take particular nutri-
ents from the soil, which suppress or invite specific pests, and which prepare the soil in (dis)advantageous ways for 
successive crops to produce field-level practice, and from those factors to create a spatio-temporal choreography of 
farm-scale regenerative management. Figure  3 is the first diagram we developed to capture this vertically arranged 
microscopic–field–farm imaginary.
Distinctions can already be traced between this spatial imaginary and those that govern the plantation that we 
encountered earlier. Rather than expanding a simplified and highly productive agroecology over areas of increas -
ing spatial extent, those in the regenerative movement use insights about water, nutrients, and energy to develop 
management practices that can be applied to their fields, and they assemble those land uses to create regenerative 
strategies that cover the farm's full territory. This allows them to move away from the chemical inputs used in the 
plantation model to manage fertility and pests and towards the curation of heterogeneous (farmed) landscape struc-
tures composed of individual (field) patches. Soil fertility, water drainage, soil structure, and pest suppression are 
emergent features of this regenerative agroecological arrangement, rather than things secured through mechanical 
and/or chemical intervention.
2.3 | Horizontal connections and livestock stomachs
While there are many aspects of the regenerative model that its practitioners conceive of through the above microscopic–
field–farm vertical imaginary, there are others that cannot be accounted for in this way. For these, our farmers imagine 
a horizontal web of causal connection as part of their regenerative strategies. These horizontal imaginaries help map the 
agro-ethical responsibilities that arise from connections that spill out over the farm gate and exceed the confines of the

farm (Cusworth,  2023). The stomachs of livestock animals are one important site through which these horizontal link-
ages are thought through.
Regenerative practitioners distinguish their grazing strategies (whereby animals consume only grass and locally pro -
duced fodder) from intensive livestock husbandry practices (in which the animals eat feed products made of soya and 
other high-protein compounds grown around the world). They are enthusiastic about the positive roles that ruminant 
animals (like cattle and sheep) can play in a sustainable food system compared to chickens and pigs. This is because 
ruminants can graze on grass, hay, sileage, cover crops grown in between cash crop rotations (used for arable–livestock 
integration) and other fodder crops like beets, beans, and peas. Monogastric systems, on the other hand, are overwhelm-
ingly reliant on high-protein compound feed products. As one farmer put it:
Pork and chicken is fed from a globalised food system, bringing in artificial maize, soya, grains, with nutri-
ent-rich, polluting manure coming out at the other end … that's not really going to work in the years to come. 
The ruminant that's grazing and pooing where they are … that's the system that is going to work. 
George Hosier, 650 ha mixed livestock arable farming
Such invocations illustrate how animal rumens are sites through which the farm's horizontal connections to, and responsibil-
ities for, distant landscapes are made knowable, affecting, and actionable. Crops grown for animal feed are having profound 
and negative impacts, particularly in the Amazon and Cerrado forests (Barona et al.,  2010) where land is being converted 
to monocrop soya plantation. Regenerative ‘pasture-based’ livestock systems are being developed to combat these land use 
change dynamics by renouncing the supply chains underpinning them. This boutique feed supply chain reveals efforts being 
made in the regenerative movement to think through relationships between husbandry practices in one patch of the world 
and deforestation and land use change in others. Such global trade connections are classic examples of horizontally net -
worked spatial connections (Yao et al.,  2018). Their linkages traverse the bounded regional and national units provided in 
vertically nested scalar frameworks, and instead focus on those vectors linking causes with remote outcomes (Leitner,  2004).
Overwintering is a good example of how reflections about distant horizontal spatial relations, made corporeal via the 
digestive activities of livestock animals, are propelling the development of new farm management practices. While most 
livestock farmers in the UK will graze their animals outdoors over the summer to some extent, virtually all rely on im-
portant feed products to get them through the winter. As such, particular efforts need to be made to ensure that animals 
can survive exclusively on locally grown feeds the year round. Figure  4 is an image of a parkland field being prepared for 
a winter of outdoor grazing. It has been marked out on GIS software into equal cells, each of which has been populated 
with four hay bales. Over the course of the winter, the cows will be moved between the cells (created through temporary 
fencing infrastructures), eating the fresh sugary grass first, before moving onto the hay when it runs out.
The regenerative preference for locally grown feed represents a spatial intervention through which the horizontal 
connections conjoining the UK livestock sector with the Amazon rainforest are being renegotiated, and even severed 
entirely. Although these strategies clearly have their own verticality (dividing a large area of parkland into smaller blocs 
and applying practices onto a field's and farm's areal coverage), the regenerative desire to install them is configured by 
a horizontal imaginary of spatial relations: one equipped to account for the vectors of globalised supply chains, and the

political economic forces driving deleterious land use in distant parts of the world. The rationale for the adoption of such 
practices is, of course, always part driven by concerns about the financial costliness of expensive feed products (with one 
dairy farmer interviewee, Dan Burdett, explaining that ‘There are years when yield is king. But a lot of years when costs 
are very high and you have to keep them down. So, you know, profit is everything’). Nevertheless, across our data and 
across the literature on the topic, engagement with global environmental issues such as deforestation is a remarkably 
consistent feature of the regenerative psyche (Jaworski et al., 2023).
Figure  5 is the second of our spatial diagrams and shows how remote causal connections are folded into regenerative 
farm management.
Efforts to act on the injurious socio-ecological implications of participating in animal feed supply chains represent an 
important departure from the spatiality of the plantation model. In the plantation, it is only those ecological processes 
(crop growth, animal reproduction, etc.) that produce financial value that are taken into account. Here, farms are being 
managed with respect to outcomes that do not have implications for the running of the farm business or socio-ecological 
outcomes that will be experienced in or near to the landscapes being managed.
2.4 | Volumetric thinking and agricultural soils
Regenerative practitioners situate their soils as part of a global land use system that could, if properly orchestrated, make 
a substantial contribution to warming mitigation. As one farmer suggested:
Of all the different ways that we can avoid catastrophic planet change, by far the easiest and cheapest way is 
by looking after the soil on a worldwide level. 
John Cherry, 1,000 ha mixed livestock arable farming and organiser of the Groundswell regenerative 
 agriculture show
There is a complex spatial imaginary at work here. Carbon dioxide emissions, wherever they originate, contribute 
to the global atmospheric stock. They are the ultimate fungible environmental pollutant (Cooper,  2015). As the 
polluting and offsetting activities of actors on opposite sides of the globe add or subtract to an aggregate stock of 
greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing, climate change can be thought of as being toggled to the topmost 
level of a vertical hierarchy that links the emissions of individual farms to the regions, to nations, and finally to the 
whole world. Regenerative farmers, in this way, frame their farms as the compositional units through which climate 
mitigation efforts can be enacted.
To deliver on this promise, however, farmers think volumetrically about their soils. They reflect on the ecological 
interactions that lead to additional organic matter being stored in the soil's three-dimensional coverage, and the process 
through which soil builds deeper into the earth. As one farmer explained:
What if we are getting an extra millimetre of soil a year? I know there's a level where we might get stuck 
at, I don't know, 12% organic matter, but we are seeing another millimetre, two millimetres of soil. So 
it's soil mass and depth too. This farm is on a gentle slope and that soil was being washed off … we're

rebuilding it back up gently and slowly. And let's add that into the tonnage of carbon [for emissions 
 accounting purposes]. 
Jonty Brunyee, regenerative agriculture educator and researcher
Several regenerative practices are used to build soil structure, organic content, and depth. Our participants commonly see the 
most important step being to minimise or stop tillage. Doing so removes the disturbing effects of soil cultivation and reduces 
exposure to erosion (which represents the loss of soil depth) and atmospheric interaction (in which the nutrients in the soil 
are released as gases). No-till is usually done in conjunction with establishment of undersown or cover crops, which ensure 
the soil is covered at all times, even after an arable crop has been harvested. By keeping soils covered, and by keeping living 
roots in the ground over the entirety of the agricultural calendar, regenerative farmers are working to build healthy soils, 
whose nutrient and carbon content is less exposed to breakdown, and whose depth is less subject to the eroding effects of the 
wind and rain.
For these same soil-health reasons, regenerative farmers also consider the depth that different plant roots tap. 
Regenerative farmers collocate plants with longer root systems with plants whose roots tap much shallower, allowing 
them to access the nutrients stored in different strata of soil depth without competing with one another. This helps the 
farmers get the most out of the soil's finite supply of nutrients. Deep tapping root systems are illustrated in the chart in 
Figure  6 (which we found to be ubiquitous in the offices of regenerative farmers). They are valued for how they help the 
soil system build deeper into the earth. Deep-tapping roots pierce the earth under the soil, and introduce the moisture 
and biology needed to turn it into humus. This effectively increases the volume into which regenerative farmers can 
enhance their carbon, nutrient and water reserves: techniques that are central to the carbon farming ambitions of the 
regenerative model (Schreefel et al., 2020).
Among our interviewees, there were conflicting perspectives about how this soil carbon sequestration story should (or 
should not) interface with the running of the farm business. While some were excited at the prospect of monetising their 
stored carbon in the form of emission offsets, others were more hesitant:

I don't trust any of them to be honest. I almost signed up and I started thinking well, if I was the person 
 buying the carbon credit I would want to know where that carbon is, how much of it there is and I would 
want proof of it. And I don't think anyone can actually do that yet. 
Andy Howarth arable farmer managing 300 ha
What is consistent however, across both our data and the literature, is the regenerative focus on soil health (Jaworski 
et al.,  2023). Such efforts to increase soil depth and improve its carbon content, ecological complexity, water retention, struc-
ture, and fertility represent a spatial departure from the plantation model. In intensive conventional farming, soils are seen as 
little more than a substrate within which crops are grown. Key nutrients are added to ensure crop growth, and pesticides are 
used to manage disease and weeds. In the regenerative model, by contrast, soil is regarded as lively, complex, and agential. Its 
good health demands the minimisation of soil disturbance, the reduction of pesticides, and the presence of diverse vegetation. 
Multispecies entanglements do not just inhabit soil's volume in this understanding, they are  soil's volume (Krzywoszynska 
& Marchesi,  2020). The differences in these models is not so much a distinction between the spaces identified as areas of 
concern (both arrive at the soil as a site necessitating active management) but rather the strategies different farmers use with 
regards to these spaces. Figure  7 is our diagrammatic representation of this volumetric engagement.
2.5 | Farming for the patchy Anthropocene
What can these farmers contribute to the ongoing academic efforts to spatialise the Anthropocene? What can they teach 
us about the benefits of rejecting the plantation model of agricultural land management in favour of productive farmed 
landscapes that enable multispecies resurgence (Tsing et al.,  2017)?
Figure  8 is an amalgamation of the three images we have used to illustrate our three spatial imaginaries of nested ver -
tical scales and fields, horizontal connections and rumens, and depth and soil. It shows how multiple spatial imaginaries 
are overlaid and juxtaposed in the regenerative mindscape. While not exhaustive, it conveys how the regenerative model 
enacted by our research participants is premised on a ‘polymorphic’ (Jessop et al., 2008) approach to spatial relations.
Tsing and colleagues place great value on how the juxtaposition of multiple systems-as-thought-experiments gains 
analytic traction on the emplaced yet ubiquitous character of the patchy Anthropocene. Although they present their 
discussion in relation to the overlaying of different models of political economy, non-secular cosmology, and ecology, 
the above hybrid regenerative spatial imaginary also fits the bill. Take the regenerative engagement with the issue 
of climate change and warming mitigation. While volumetric concerns (how deep does soil go, how much carbon 
is stored in its three-dimensional coverage) get to the very heart of regenerative agriculturalists’ climate mitigation 
agenda (Schreefel et al.,  2020), they are always enacted through and for other spatial considerations. The desire to 
make use of the soil's carbon offsetting potential is, for example, underpinned by a framing that grapples with a 
globalised sink of emissions and offsets and an associated set of diffuse climactic outcomes. Regenerative contribu-
tions to emissions offsetting, although inherently volumetric in their nature, are achieved by applying regenerative

practices onto the areal coverage of the farm and its constituent fields. The practices of no-till, cover cropping, live -
stock–arable integration, and crop diversification, which are all designed to build soil depth and increase its carbon 
content, are effectively applied onto the land as if it were a flat two-dimensional cartographic area. As discussed 
above, these practices are predicated on a conceptualisation of the farm as a set of vertically nested spaces, in which 
field-level practices, which are informed by understandings of microscopic processes relating to water, nutrients, and 
energy, are assembled into farm-scale strategies.
The same proclivity for juxtaposing and overlaying is at work in regenerative efforts to build soil depth and the ecol-
ogies and fertility contained in its volume. These ambitions are designed to reduce the holding's financial overheads of 
pesticide and fertiliser inputs, limit the farm's contribution to water pollution (which happens when excess fertiliser is 
applied to the land such that it runs off into local waterways), and to sever its connections with energy-intensive synthetic 
fertiliser production systems. These concerns each have their own set of spatial characteristics. Farms are joined (or not) 
to fertiliser production facilities through international horizontal supply chains, and they are situated in a vertically 
arranged nested system connecting their farms to landscape and local and regional water-pollution levels. Regenerative 
farmers seek to act on these concerns through volumetrically engaged strategies: building fertility and ecological com-
plexity downwards to recast the nature of their relations outwards.
The soils, stomachs, and fields at the heart of this study are artefacts that allow ‘scholars and their subjects to 
move simultaneously through deep time and human time, through geological space and political space’ (Hecht,  2018, 
p. 135). In patchy Anthropocene parlance, through the juxtaposition of multiple systems-as-thought-experiments, 
regenerative farmers situate the specifics of individual landscape patches in the landscape structures they form, 
and those in macro-scale dynamics of land use change, biodiversity loss, and global warming. The regenerative 
spatial imaginaries described in this paper allow managerial and ethical traffic to flow between particular spaces 
and socio-ecological issues of global consequence (Cusworth,  2023). This, we believe, is an enactment of plane -
tary social thinking (Clark & Szerszynski,  2020) and an integral part of a model of food production ‘for’ the patchy 
Anthropocene (Maye et al., 2022).
