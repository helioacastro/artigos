ABSTRACT
This paper studies three sites or ‘landscapes of care ’in Leeds, Bristol
and London where water and associated built and natural environ-
ments are used to co-construct and facilitate forms of social and
environmental care. Our research narrates the ways in which blue
spaces are cultivated for the production of particular forms of caring
bodies and sensibilities. Interpreting care as both a doing (caring for)
and emotion (caring about), we draw attention to the diverse prac-
tices and distributed nature of care in these environments. Our
paper has three main insights. First, we draw attention to the role
of water as both a material and site of care. Second, we identify a
range of more-than-human bene ﬁts associated with blue spaces and
how these emerge via collaborative, non-linear and reciprocal forms
of care. Third, we argue that by understanding how care works in
everyday social practice, new forms of ecological care and pro-
environmental ways of living with the world can emerge.

ABSTRACTO
Este documento estudia tres sitios o ‘paisajes de cuidado ’en Leeds,
Bristol y Londres, donde el agua y los entornos naturales y de
construcción asociados se utilizan para co-construir y facilitar formas
de cuidado social y ambiental. Nuestra investigación narra las formas
en que los espacios azules se cultivan para la producción de formas
particulares de cuerpos de cuidado y de sensibilidades. Al interpretar
el cuidado como una actividad (el cuidar) y una emoción (el preocu-
parse), se llama la atención sobre las diversas prácticas y la naturaleza
distribuida del cuidado en estos entornos. Este trabajo tiene tres ideas
principales. Primero, se hace hincapié en el papel del agua como
material y como lugar de cuidado. En segundo lugar, se identi ﬁca
una gama de bene ﬁcios más-que-humanos asociados con los espa-
cios azules y cómo estos surgen a través de formas de cuidado
colaborativas, no lineales y recíprocas. En tercer lugar, se argumenta
que al comprender cómo funciona el cuidado en la práctica social
cotidiana, pueden surgir nuevas formas de cuidado ecológico y man-
eras de vivir con el mundo a favor del medio ambiente.
Introduction
In this paper, we present and examine three cas es of water-based social and environmental
care practices. Through the examples, we focus on the enactment of waterscapes of care,
variously positioned towards the facilitation and cultivation of individual and social transfor-
mation. Examining how care works in the co-cons truction of caring blue landscapes from the
perspective of nurturing care agents, we narrate the agencies of water in the co-production of
caring landscapes; the role of embodied care practices; and the indirect, yet interdependent
nature of care assemblages and how these cont ribute to social and environmental change.
Our broad objective is to highlight relations and interdependencies associated with blue space
and social agents in the construction of both landscapes of care and caring bodies. Our focus is
on three water-based programmes in the UK whi ch pursue social and environmental change
via interactions with blue space. The paper has three main contributions:
●First, we expand understandings of care to include the role of water and other
nonhumans (e.g. boats and water wheels) as active agents in cultivating and
performing care.1040 M. BUSER ET AL.
●Second, we engage with and advance literature on ‘blue space ’and well-being by
identifying how the bene ﬁts of blue space caring practices are not restricted to
humans.
●Third, we argue that by understanding how care works1in everyday social practice,
we identify possible routes towards new forms of ecological care and pro-
environmental ways of living with the world.
We suggest that these ﬁndings have relevance not only for care scholarship and theory,
but also for policy and the everyday delivery of care in settings of need.
The paper structure is as follows. Following this introduction we review geographical
scholarship on care. We pay attention to the way the concept has been deployed in
feminist theory and how this is being applied to nonconventional settings. Our review is
particularly concerned with the role of nonhumans in the construction of sites or land-
scapes of care. The empirical section presents our analysis of care practices across three
examples where humans, water and blue space more generally are co-collaborators in the
production of social and environmental change. The paper concludes with a review of
overall themes, re ﬂections on the cases and suggestions for further research.
Caring matters
. . .without care we would fail to thrive. Yet, despite its centrality to all aspects of our lives, it
is remarkable how marginalized care is. (Milligan & Wiles, 2010 , p. 736)
Care provides researchers with a lens to examine a range of social, political and
environmental practices and contexts. Within geography and the social sciences more
broadly care is often de ﬁned as a form of support delivered or provided through
physical (i.e. caring for) and/or emotional (i.e. caring about) labour (Bowlby, 2012 ;
Conradson, 2003 ; Held, 2006 ; Kittay, 2001 ; Milligan & Wiles, 2010 ). Within this literature,
the concept of care has often been applied to activities such as child-care and house-
work and other forms of emotional labour (Boyer, Reimer, & Irvine, 2013 ). Feminist
thinkers, in particular, brought this form of care-work to scholarly attention by demon-
strating the pervasiveness of care throughout society and in everyday life (Cox, 2010 ;
Lawson, 2007 ). Yet, while this research made the role of care-work more visible, it also
exposed the multiple forms of relationships and inequalities associated with care
including how care-work tends to be gendered, devalued, and un- or underpaid
(England, 1996 ; McDowell, 2008 ; Tronto, 1993 ).
Use of the concept of care as an analytical device is not without contention. For
example, scholars in areas such as disability studies have criticised the dependent-laden
notions of care and tend to avoid the concept in favour of other ways of analysing the
agency of disabled people and their relations with various support groups, institutions
and individuals (for a review, see: Kröger, 2009 ). However, when ‘being “cared for ”is a
condition of all beings ’(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 205), we argue that it is too crucial
to social and environmental relations and too powerful an analytical tool to be ignored.
As Joan Tronto argues, care is. . .SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1041
everything that we do to maintain, continue and repair our world so that we can live in it as
well as possible. That world includes our bodies, ourselves and our environment, all of
which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. (Tronto, 1993 , p. 103)
For Tronto, care is present across the diversity of our engagements with the world
ranging from everyday practices of getting through the day to addressing seemingly
intractable global concerns. From this perspective, relations of care are not isolated from
the density of and intricacies that make up any social situation. Moreover, how care
works is rarely straightforward, uniform or unidirectional and need not be a disempow-
ering notion framed by one-way dependencies. For our research, we are particularly
interested in the spaces and practices of care associated with programmes for social
change including the nature or quality of facilitated encounters (Pitt, 2018 ; Valentine,
2008 ) which might contribute to bene ﬁcial social and environmental outcomes.
Interdependencies of care
Recent scholarship has advanced understandings of the concept of care beyond dualis-
tic and dependent relations between care giver and care receiver. This thinking moves
towards wider recognition of ‘a complex network of actors and actions ’(Milligan & Wiles,
2010 , p. 737) involved in the relations of care implied by Tronto ’sd eﬁnition. No longer
portrayed exclusively in terms of one-way dependence, care is now seen as embroiled
within relations of interdependency (Fine & Glendinning, 2005 ; Groenhout, 2004 ; Kittay,
2001 ; Milligan & Wiles, 2010 ; Tronto, 1987 ; Watson, McKie, Hughes, Hopkins, & Gregory,
2004 ). Interdependency, as such, signals an interest in the complex systems of connec-
tion and reciprocity present in any care situation (Holt, 2013 ). Yet, interdependency and
reciprocity of care does not necessarily mean an equality of relations. Rather, multiple
forms and expressions of power inequalities are likely to be present in any care relation
(Bowlby, 2012 ). What is more, it is rare that an individual carer will receive an equivalent
or uniform exchange of care from the one cared for (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). Rather,
they will more likely be cared for by others and in other ways. Care providers, in other
words, are also care receivers, but often in indirect ways. Exploring these interdepen-
dencies, as we do in this paper, means being open to the vast complex of care at play in
any caring situation.
Landscapes of care
Scholarly attention to the contexts and situations of care often signals an interest in
taking account of wider social, material and place-based characteristics associated with
care practices. Building on research in health geography and writing on sites of therapy
and well-being, there is now a robust literature examining various ‘landscapes of care ’–
the spaces through which caring practices take place (Conradson, 2003 ,2008 ; Milligan &
Wiles, 2010 ). Research into the sites and spatialities of care has widened what we know
about care including how and where care practices occur. For example, in addition to
sites such as the home (Milligan, 2009 ), nurseries (Boyer et al., 2013 ), hospitals and other
sites of health care (Ge, El Hawashy, & Taha, 2011 ; Keogh & Gleeson, 2006 ), landscapes of
care might include locations such as cafés (Warner, Talbot, & Bennison, 2013 ) parks1042 M. BUSER ET AL.
(Laws, 2009 ), community gardens (Milligan, Gatrell, & Bingley, 2004 ; Pitt, 2018 ), drop-in
centres (Conradson, 2003 ) and arts spaces (Hall, 2013 ) among other informal locales
(Duﬀ,2012 ). Central to this work is recognition that these are not ﬁxed sites, but rather,
relational accomplishments where place and care are co-constituted (Ivanova,
Wallenburg, & Bal, 2016 ). For example, a site such as the home shapes and mediates
the speci ﬁc caring practices through the presence of particular material and social
component parts (i.e. what the home is as well as its social dynamic). Meanwhile
these care practices go on to in ﬂuence the way people come to perceive, experience
and understand their homes (Milligan & Wiles, 2010 ; see also: Wiles, 2003a ,2003b ). Care
relations, in other words, are co-produced and circular as they are ‘located in, shaped by,
and shape particular spaces and places. . . ’(Milligan & Wiles, 2010 , p. 736; see also:
Bowlby, 2012 ). For example, in a relational study of the ‘enabling places ’associated
with recovery from mental health illness, Du ﬀ(2012 , p. 1389; see also Du ﬀ,2011 )
suggests that therapeutic and restorative places are made up through a ‘web of
associations ’between social, material and a ﬀective resources. Healthy, positive and
restorative experiences and outcomes are thus ‘nurtured ’and not ‘innately therapeutic ’
but rather, are ‘cultivated ’and individually experienced (Du ﬀ,2012 , p. 1393 –1394). Till
(2012 , p. 5) suggests that these resources contribute to a ‘place-based ethics of care ’
where processes of caring are understood as ‘ethical and political practices ’. Our
research engages with and advances these relational examinations of care and place.
Drawing on advances in Science and Technology Studies and Non-representational
Theory, care scholars have also begun to take seriously the role of the nonhuman
actants in the co-construction of caring sites and assemblages (see Armstrong, 2006 ;
Gorman, 2017 ;Miele & Evans, 2010 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010 ).
By assemblage, we highlight analytical thinking that centres on the relations between
‘heterogeneous yet connected component parts of the city ’(Buser, 2018 , p. 769;
McFarlane, 2011a ,2011b ) and the coming together of diverse (more-than-human)
‘bodies, forces, spaces and objects ’(Duﬀ,2016 , p. 63) in particular caring situations.
This research shows that care is always situated in material contexts which in ﬂuence
the nature of the relation. Taking the example of soil, Puig de la Bellacasa ( 2017 ,
p. 161) demonstrates how humans ‘are not the only ones caring for the earth and its
beings ’but rather, she shows how along with worms (and other organic and inorganic
material) ‘we are in relations of mutual care ’. Understanding the interdependencies
associated with (soil) care in this way suggests we need ‘to consider the many ways in
which nonhuman agencies are taking care of many human and nonhuman needs. . . ’
(2017 , p. 161 see also: Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). Care work, as such, is not an
endeavour exclusive to humans but is distr ibuted across more-than-human agencies,
where caring for can support both human and nonhuman existences. Such a perspec-
tive transforms and extends Tronto ’s understanding of agency away from a human
‘we ’(i.e. everything that we do) and towards a more-than-human ‘us’(everything that
is done) (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ).
Within the frame of this paper, such thinking suggests that the speci ﬁc characteristics
and a ﬀects of water (and water environments) can have signi ﬁcant implications for the
nature of caring practices situated in watery settings. In this sense, water and its
associated material and discursive contexts are non-neutral agents in the practice of
care and in how care works.SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1043
Water and care
There is, of course, a long history of water care and being with water as a means of
physical and emotional healing. Drawing on Roman and Greek belief in the restorative
qualities of water, the Victorians re-invigorated the appreciation for and practice of
congregating around and immersing in mineral waters and baths (Strang, 2015 ).
Places such as Bath or Lourdes became sites of well-being where ‘taking the waters ’
meant providing sites where individuals could reap the health bene ﬁts associated with
water (Foley, 2010 ; Gesler, 2003 ). By the late 20th century, leisure and tourist industries
brought more people into direct and active engagement with water through sports such
as swimming, sur ﬁng, paddling and other activities (Anderson, 2012 ,2013 ; Foley, 2017 ;
Strang, 2015 ). Yet, as Kearns, Collins, and Conradson ( 2014 ) note, blue space can also
isolate and detain (as in the case of island prisons and sites of quarantine) and does not
necessarily always produce positive outcomes or relations.
Recently, researchers have examined the physical and emotional health contributions
made by these forms of being in, with or near water. Health geographers, often drawing
on earlier research and experiences of green space, have sought to understand and
account for the speci ﬁc well-being attributes associated with ‘blue space ’. In this work, a
blue space is commonly referred to as any ocean, lake, river, fountain, stream or other
accessible surface water within an environment (Volker, Matros, & Claben, 2016 ). Within
urban areas, adequate blue space is commonly seen as a key contributor to a city ’s
overall sustainability and quality of life (Volker et al., 2016 ), providing for both environ-
mental quality (e.g. ecosystem services) as well as social and mental well-being through
opportunities for leisure, relaxation and recreation (Finlay, Franke, McKay, & Sims-Gould,
2015 ; Raymond, Gottwald, Kuoppa, & Kyttä, 2016 ). Foley and Kistemann ( 2015 , p. 158)
point to the ways in which –much like green space –blue spaces can be ‘health-
enabling ’landscapes which support the well-being of human inhabitants (see also
Coleman & Kearns, 2015 ; Foley & Kistemann, 2015 ). Other scholarship has focused on
the therapeutic experiences and well-being potential (both physical and mental) asso-
ciated with coastal areas (White, Alcock, Wheeler, & Depledge, 2011 ; White, Pahl,
Ashbulby, & Herbert, 2013 ). This growing area of scholarship is building a robust case
for the therapeutic connections between people and water.
The predominance of blue space literature focuses almost exclusively on human
beneﬁts. In the language of care, it narrates largely one-way systems of dependency
(i.e. how people bene ﬁt from water). However, in addition to the direct health bene ﬁts
for humans, interactions and engagements with water (e.g. through recreation) are also
said to contribute to increased awareness and care for the environment and ecological
well-being (Strang, 2015 ). Such claims correspond with the notion that direct connection
with nature can facilitate a form of ecological citizenship framed by pro-environmental
attitudes and behaviour. Yet, Hannah Pitt ( 2018 ) warns that contact alone is unlikely to
facilitate strong ethical concern for nonhuman well-being. Drawing on Gill Valentine ’s
work on encounters (Valentine, 2008 ; Valentine & Sandgrove, 2014 ), Pitt suggests that in
order to understand how interactions and physical connection might produce moral
ethical concerns with nonhumans, one must move beyond contact and examine the
nature and quality of these relations. In this paper, we seek to advance understandings1044 M. BUSER ET AL.
of blue space by applying a more-than-human concept of care that draws out the co-
constitutive and distributed nature of care relations.
Water-based socially engaged practice
In this section, we examine three cases of water-based social practice (Leeson, 2017 )
where collaborative processes and ‘aesthetic experience ’serve to challenge orthodoxy
and conventional beliefs (Kester, 2011 , p. 11). Each of the cases discussed here re ﬂect the
work of partners who participated in an AHRC-funded research programme entitled
Towards Hydrocitizenship (2014 –2017). This arts-led research project interrogated the
ways in which citizens and communities relate to, with and through water. The research
sought to critique and advance ideas around ‘community ’(e.g. what they are, how they
function) and the role of water assets and issues in community relations. Broadly, the
concept of ‘hydrocitizenship ’references the wider notion of ecological citizenship, which
sees the need for transformations in how society works at individual and collective
levels, as essential if humans are going to generate more ecologically sustainable forms
of living (Dobson, 2003 ; Roe & Buser, 2016 ). Our focus on water re ﬂected an e ﬀort to
narrow the concept towards one (albeit central) aspect of ecological thinking –relations
of water. Nevertheless, our engagement with water and communities of water was
diverse and included individuals who manage and maintain urban water infrastructure,
communities and residents impacted by ﬂooding, sea level rise and coastal erosion,
advocates of water heritage and environmental management, as well as nonhumans
such as eels and other species which inhabit local waterways, amongst others. Moreover,
as Towards Hydrocitizenship was situated in the AHRC ’s Connected Communities pro-
gramme, non-academics (e.g. artists, community facilitators, social enterprises, etc.) were
involved as collaborators in research design and processes. The central analytical focus
of our paper is made up of three of these partner organisations –Canal Connections, My
Future My Choice and Active Energy. These projects were selected for participation in
the research as each demonstrated creative, socially engaged approaches to working
with people through the context of water. The ﬁrst two –Canal Connections and My
Future My Choice –are registered charities that work predominately with young people
in order to bene ﬁt society while Active Energy is an informal collaboration led by artist
Loraine Leeson and focuses on the needs of older people. Each of these programmes (to
varying degrees) demonstrates elements of social entrepreneurship, meaning their
‘primary mission . . . (is) one of creating social value by providing solutions to social
problems ’(Dacin, Dacin, & Tracey, 2011 , p. 1204). Yet, in this paper, we do not evaluate
or measure the impacts of these projects. Rather we examine ‘why ’and ‘how ’our
partners facilitated caring blue spaces.
Researchers collaborated and engaged with Canal Connections, My Future My Choice,
and Active Energy at regular intervals over three years. Leaders of each programme were
formal project partners in the research. As such, we were able to have an open dialogue
and learn from numerous informal discussions at project meetings and related events. In
addition, researchers served as participant observers at a number of community events,
workshops and presentations led by the three organisations (e.g. public launch of Active
Energy ’s water wheel and participation in National Mills Weekend). Ethical approval toSOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1045
work with these organisations was organised by individual researcher universities and
was updated and amended along with new opportunities.2
In this paper, we report on a smaller, more speci ﬁc set of work in order to draw out
particular understandings of care. In the ﬁnal year of the project, we conducted three
semi-structured interviews with leaders at each organisation. Interviews lasted between
2 and 3 h (over a period of 2 days during project meetings) and were designed to
explore and understand the role of water and care in these contexts. In this way, our
questions centred on learning about the spaces and (more-than-human) relations
facilitated through each programme and how these might relate to diverse notions of
care. Interviewees were enthusiastic contributors and did not want their organisations
and names to be anonymous. In addition, the paper draws on participation and
observation at three partner-facilitated events. This includes a boat tour of Leeds canals
led by Canal Connections (November 2016), a ‘learning ships ’workshop and tour of
Bristol harbour facilitated by My Future My Choice (January 2017) and participation at
the launch of Active Energy ’s Water Wheel (May 2017). Each observation lasted a full day
(approximately 8 h) and was intended to examine and understand how our partners
framed their practice. During these events and observations, the university team was
brieﬂy introduced to programme sta ﬀand participants (where present). We did not ask
questions or interact with participants in a signi ﬁcant way, as our intent was simply to
observe how these programmes worked. Moreover, for this research, we did not attempt
to gauge e ﬀectiveness or measure participant impacts. Rather, this research centres on
‘why ’and ‘how ’our partners facilitated encounters in and with water. Speci ﬁcally
drawing on our framing of care, analysis details the function of (watery) spaces in
engagement practices, the role of embodied encounters and identi ﬁcation of the
various ﬂows3of care within these contexts.
Following a brief introduction to each partner, we examine a range of care relations
across these analytical frames. Our objective is to draw out the relations and interde-
pendencies between blue space and social agents (our partners) in the construction of
enabling places (Du ﬀ,2012 ) and particular landscapes of care and caring bodies.
Canal connections
Trevor Roberts is a former police o ﬃcer who set up Canal Connections in 2012 for the
purposes of demonstrating the potential of Leeds ’waterways for social regeneration. By
taking young teens (the majority of participants are 13 to 15 years old) on canal boat
trips and placing them in diverse ‘real world ’situations, Canal Connections provides
opportunities for disadvantaged or socially isolated young people to gain a diversity of
experiences and life skills. Participants come from a range of backgrounds and pro-
grammes in Leeds including via engagements with the city ’s Youth O ﬀending Team. In
addition to providing bene ﬁts to participants, Trevor sees the project as part of a wider
eﬀort to care for and ‘animate ’the water spaces of Leeds (TR 9/11/16).
My future my choice
My Future My Choice (MFMC) is a Bristol based organisation that seeks to boost the
conﬁdence and aspirations of young people (generally ages 10 to 12). One of the1046 M. BUSER ET AL.
organisation ’s core programmes, ‘Learning Ships ’helps children explore Bristol ’s water
heritage through boat tours of the harbour, visits with shipbuilders and participation in
boat-building workshops. Led by Hugh Thomas, Learning Ships is designed to use
Bristol ’s maritime history to inspire, increase aspirations and help build skills amongst
young participants.
Active energy
Loraine Leeson is an artist with extensive background and experience in community arts
and socially engaged practice. Active Energy is an ongoing collaboration between
Loraine, volunteers and a group of older men based in Bow, East London known as
‘the Geezers ’. In 2017, after several years of design and construction work, the group
installed a stream wheel in the Bow Creek (a tributary of the River Lea in London). The
wheel uses tidal energy to oxygenate the water, contributing to improvement of the
watercourse and a healthier ecology for the Bow Creek ﬁsh.
In the sections below, we focus on the recent work and experiences of Trevor, Hugh
and Loraine (attributed interview quotes are indicated by TR, HT and LL, respectively). In
our discussions and observations, all three emphasised interaction that brought indivi-
duals with little or no water experience to local watery spaces. Engagement with water
tended to be explorative and open-ended and generally allowed for a range of partici-
pant agency. While there was no single unifying objective, our partners commonly
described ‘success ’as the construction of quality experiences and situations where
people would be able to explore and express their sense of community, belonging
and citizenship.
Our empirical work is presented across three themes which speak to and advance the
literature on care. In looking at situations of socially engaged (care) practice, we con-
tribute to understandings of ‘how care works ’by drawing out the relations and inter-
dependencies of care associated with the co-construction of particular landscapes of
care. First, we look at how care emerges from situated local contexts and in particular
how water is an active agent and collaborator in the production of speci ﬁc caring
landscapes. Second, we draw attention to care as embodied practice by detailing
moments of making, touching, looking and other sensory engagements at work in our
examples. Third, we examine the interdependencies and networks involved in water-
care assemblages and how these relate to the potential for social and environmental
transformation. These analytical framings emerged through discussion with community
partners and analysis of data which included interviews and multiple informal conversa-
tions with Trevor, Hugh and Loraine over the course of the project and participation as
observers in their activities and programmes.
Caring blue spaces
‘Leeds owes its very existence to water. . . ’(TR 9/11/16)
The conditions of Leeds waterways have changed signi ﬁcantly since the height of the
industrial era. From Trevor Roberts ’perspective, the canals were once the lifeblood of
the city but today they serve as an edge-space largely forgotten and ignored.SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1047
. . .water space goes right through the middle of Leeds . . . [but] nobody has really got any
ownership of it. It actually acts as an area boundary. . . it ’s a boundary of everywhere so
therefore nobody takes ownership of it. . .. (TR, 9/11/16)
By ownership and boundaries, Trevor is not suggesting that there are no canal users.
Rather, he is referring to the way in which the canal has served as a territorial boundary for
certain young people who may feel uncomfortable in certain parts of the city. During our
discussion, Trevor noted how young people might be more inclined to participate in
activities along the canal rather than within particular neighbourhoods which may be seen
to be ‘rival ’territory. Yet, Trevor turns this overlooked and so-called unclaimed condition
of the canals to his advantage. Working in this ‘neutral territory ’, as he explained it, he has
found a unique space in the city through which to engage individuals who may be
suspicious of participating in activities within rival neighbourhoods. Cutting across the
city, the so-called ‘unclaimed ’canals become connectors, allowing interactions with and
through the city and opening up new ways of communicating with disadvantaged youth
(TR 9/11/16). Within these spaces, Canal Connections facilitates exploratory and non-
didactic engagements between people and water. According to Trevor, traveling at 5
miles/h on a traditional canal boat, young participants are given something they may
otherwise take for granted –the time for self-discovery and to re ﬂect on how their lives ﬁt
into this hitherto unknown urban landscape. Trevor is adamant, ‘the boat is fundamental ’
he says, to opening up opportunities for something di ﬀerent and transformative to occur
in the lives of disadvantaged urban youth.
Moreover, for some participants, this ‘unexplored ’environment can provide a spark of
agency. As Trevor notes: ‘We ’ve done work with people [of disadvantage]. . . and actually
just taking them out on a boat. . . they . . . start responding to that environment and say
“well look at this rubbish there, that ’s wrong ”... i t ’s an activator for them to actually do
something more. . . ’(TR 9/11/16). This is one example of how participants in Canal
Connections might connect to other canal users (e.g. those leaving litter). Trevor
noted how, for some, these encounters provided a sense of awareness of the power
of individual actions (not only to do harm, but to contribute in a meaningful and
positive way). This notion of the environment as an activator coheres to other research
which found that engagements with the environment can enhance pro-environmental
behaviour (Wyles, Pahl, Holland, & Thompson, 2017 ).
Yet, not all participants will take to picking up litter. Rather, they will respond in their
own way. During our conversations, Trevor recounted a number of instances where
participants discovered new interests from the experiences with Canal Connections
including, for example, managing the boat but also doing canal maintenance work,
taking up photography (e.g. to produce visual histories of the canal) and cooking (one
participant has gone on to train as a chef). These are forms of engagement and
transformation that develop from the ﬂows of the experience. The form of this trans-
formation is not set out in advance. In other words, Canal Connections does not
explicitly seek to get young people into photography, cooking or even canal mainte-
nance. Nevertheless, the boat (as a frame for activity) provides opportunity for these and
many other interests and skills to develop. Trevor claims that the canal space is
particularly useful in stimulating new interests which can go on to in ﬂuence a young
person ’s life beyond the canal. Nevertheless, while there is a level of informality and1048 M. BUSER ET AL.
openness to these experiences, as an ‘enabling place ’(Duﬀ,2011 ,2012 ) for social
change and care, positive outcomes are not inherent to the canals but rather are
carefully managed and nurtured. They are, in other words, the result of a relational
association of social, material and a ﬀective resources situated in place.
There is, of course, a politics to this form of discovery. These canal spaces are situated
within the ubiquitous cultural landscape of Leeds ’post-industrial urban waterfront. As
such, being on the water with Canal Connections means participating in a particular
interpretation of urban heritage. This engagement with industrial heritage and maritime
history was evident across all three projects. For example, during an observation event
with MFMC, participants sailed through Bristol Harbour to meet boat builders and ship-
wrights, visit a replica of The Matthew4and cruise past Brunel ’s refurbished SS Great
Britain. The message of the tour was di ﬃcult to miss –as Bristolians these young people
are part of a celebrated lineage of explorers and engineers. Hugh Thomas explains, ‘just
taking the kids down the river on the boat and you get to Avonmouth and you say this
goes everywhere in the world. From here you can sail anywhere. . . ’(HT 14/10/16). In much
the same way as Canal Connections, Learning Ships draws on the historic setting of the
local water landscape (here Bristol ’s harbour) to provide the context within which parti-
cipants explore their place in the world and, it is hoped, ﬁnd inspiration.
In Loraine ’s work with Active Energy, it is no accident that the Geezers ’stream wheel
is located at Three Mills in East London –one of the oldest and largest tidal mills in the
world. The site provides links between England ’s early industrial heritage and contem-
porary interest in sustainable rivers. Moreover, as a tidal tributary of the Lea, the Bow
Creek provides a frame for action where water wheels can play an important role. The
mill pool where the apparatus sits ﬁlls up at high tide. As the tide goes out and the pool
empties, the wheel begins to operate and aerates the water. As Loraine says ‘it uses old
technology to drive new technology ’(LL 8/11/16). This con ﬂuence of old and new draws
on East London ’s tidal rivers and the area ’s industrial heritage to facilitate contemporary
forms of environmental relating.
It is through these multiple relational practices of being with others (human and
nonhuman) that a canal or river becomes a caring landscape. In Leeds, Bristol and
London, we ﬁnd spaces where caring practices are evident. This is caring both ‘for’
participants by providing new forms of engagement, sociality and inspiration, as well as
supporting means of caring ‘about ’local water environments and histories. Moreover,
across our examples, caring landscapes were facilitated by Trevor, Hugh and Loraine, but
constructed in concert with the wider contextualised material and social assemblages of
these spaces. Much like the way a home, as a context for care, will shape particular care
practices that take place there (Milligan & Wiles, 2010 ), the rivers and canals in our
examples frame the forms of support, engagement and encounters that take place.
Within the next section, we take a closer look at the speci ﬁc characteristics of moments
of encounter and care taking place in blue spaces.
Embodied and sensory engagements with water
. . .the idea of using hands . . . is a big part of the interest for us. . . Kids don ’t use their hands a
lot you know. (HT 14/10/16)SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1049
Care is variously described as both an ethical disposition and a form of practice
(Kullman, 2014 ). Care-work is often framed as attentiveness to the welfare of others
(England, 2005 ) through processes of looking after (e.g. feeding a child) and other forms
of physical and emotional labour (Conradson, 2003 ). In this section, we focus on
particular physical forms of care where ‘doing ’means not only looking after, but also
being involved in a process of becoming aware of oneself as well as (non)human others.
During our time with Trevor, Hugh and Loraine, we learned about and witnessed
attention and promotion of embodied ‘doings ’with water. With Canal Connections,
young participants actively engage with canal life by, for example, driving boats,
operating and maintaining locks, making tea and cooking for fellow boaters, picking
up litter, and managing canal side environments. Trevor re ﬂects on the empowerment
associated with these kinds of responsibilities:
if somebody comes and says right there you are you can drive the boat and that ’s the ﬁrst
time that anybody ’s actually said you can do that, normally they say well you can ’t do that,
you can ’t do this, you can ’t do the other, you ’re actually saying to someone here you are
take this ﬁfty foot boat away and drive it away and so you ’re giving them something. (TR 9/
11/6)
Trevor sees the change this form of engagement can produce –something emerges
which he calls ‘the long view ’where a young person is now looking across the water in a
way that ‘the entire environment slows people down ’(TR 9/11/16). Jones argues that
such bodily attunement re ﬂects a form of intimacy through which we can come to know
nonhumans and possibly ‘complicate and change the way we think about them ’(2017 ,
16). The long view which Trevor refers to is his representation of how some participants ’
bodies become more involved and more intimately connected to the watery space. For
Canal Connections, this is a crucial step in building an ethics of care.
Hugh ’s work in MFMC engages a younger cohort of primary school children and does
not facilitate quite the same level of agency and responsibility. Nevertheless, there is a
central focus on embodied practices (often involving the hands) within these learning
activities. For example, on our observation day (following the harbour tour) MFMC
participants worked in groups to construct cardboard replicas of the boats they visited
in Bristol ’s waterfront. This hands-on way of working is essential to the objectives of
MFMC:
. . .it is something that I feel people are losing as well in a big way and they are losing that,
because of that they lose their contact, the immediate physical contact with the world . . .
touch the world and alter the world and change the world. . .. (HT 14/10/16)
For Loraine ’s Geezers, a good deal of the physical labour was conducted by (younger)
volunteers. However, engagement processes were centred on ‘making ’. It was not
enough to meet and talk about tidal energy. Rather, the group mobilised to intervene
and become active in looking after vulnerable others. For example, the Geezers ’original
objective when they started working with Loraine was to help East Londoners who
suﬀered from fuel poverty. The prospect of tidal power seemed to be an untapped
resource in tidal London. Drawing on her participatory arts background, Loraine facili-
tated inquiry and active engagement by enabling moments of encounter and ways of
‘being with ’and caring for other people and things that built on the enthusiasms and1050 M. BUSER ET AL.
interests of the Geezers. Calling on their earlier experience in construction and
mechanics, the group worked with engineers and started to come up with their own
wheel designs. These were further developed through renewable energy workshops
held at a local (Bow) boys ’school where prototype wheels were constructed.
At times, we noted how these sensory and embodied experiences facilitated new bodily
connections with nonhumans. To be in contact with the weather, tides, the feel of water is to
upset an everyday balance and create new rhythms. For Trevor, just being on the water was
found to be an invigorating and disruptive sensation where alternate temporalities, per-
spectives, environmental conditions and concerns might come to the fore. Across these
projects, engagements with the (non-familiar) materiality of water formed a critical part of
how our partners sought to produce caring bodies (variously emotional, political and active).
Yet, we note that contact alone does not inevitably produce ethical concern and
‘more caring relationships ’with non-humans (Pitt, 2018 , p. 255). Of course, this inter-
ference with the everyday we refer to above can be negatively felt by individuals for
whom being within blue space landscapes might produce feelings of distress and
discomfort (Bell, Foley, Houghton, Maddrell, & Williams, 2018 ; Thomas, 2015 ). Indeed,
each partner noted how invariably, some participants were not comfortable participat-
ing in the spaces and activities they had designed. Moreover, there is nothing inherently
‘therapeutic ’about the spaces within which our partners work. Rather, positive experi-
ences emerge via ‘sociocultural-material-a ﬀective-sensuous con ﬁgurations involving
both human and non-human actors ’(Bell et al., 2018 , p. 128); it is the qualities of
relating that matter. For example, in her research on community gardeners, Hannah
Pitt counters conventional wisdom that direct contact with nature leads to more ethical
regard and care for nonhumans. Other research has argued that embodied, practice-
oriented encounters alone are unlikely to produce a particular pro-environmental sub-
ject, but rather, these experiences must be supported by ways of relating di ﬀerently
(Roe & Buser, 2016 ; see also Wyles et al., 2017 ; on the role of beach cleans as a means to
raise marine awareness and pro-environmental behaviour).
Nevertheless, there is clearly a role for practice-based and embodied encounters in
cultivating ‘the desire to care ’within environmental contexts (Jones, 2017 , p. 7). As Bell
et al. ( 2015 , p. 61) point out in the context of the coast, critical here are the ‘internally
felt bodily sensations ’which re ﬂect the ‘fullness ’or ‘wholeness ’in the way people
experience the therapeutics of particular landscapes of care. This, we argue, is an
important characteristic of water which can facilitate multiple forms of bodily and
sensory connection. Next, we re ﬂect on the quality of these relatings and in particular
their ability to bring to the fore reciprocal forms of care.
Interdependencies of care
These forms of social and environmental practice are situated in understandings of care
for the world as ‘interdependent ’and reciprocal. In this way of thinking, humans and the
environment do not occupy distinct spheres, but are intimately connected.
Interdependence, as Pitt notes, ‘suggests a non-hierarchical relationship in which others
determine their own needs. Relationships of interdependence typify an ecological out-
look recognising mutual bene ﬁts for humans and nonhumans ’(Pitt, 2018 , p. 266). Within
the multi-directional ﬂows of care we witnessed, the distinction between care providerSOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1051
and care receiver was tangled and uncertain. Following Puig de la Bellacasa ( 2017 ),
being aware of interdependencies means moving away from instrumentalist and exploi-
tative forms of (human –nature) interactions and seeing the multiple ﬂows of bene ﬁts.
Such an approach to water would recognise how humans are entangled in relations of
care and are obligated to care for water ecologies (see Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 192).
While all three partners examined and facilitated more-than-human relations, these
forms of interdependencies were most evident in the work of Trevor and Loraine. We
focus on their work in the ﬁnal analytical section.
For Pitt ( 2018 ), an ability to expose and explore human –nature interdependencies is
part of what contributes to the quality of encounters with nonhuman others. Moreover,
encounters which might foster new caring attitudes or perspectives are likely to require
more than simple contact with the unfamiliar. Rather, transformation of this kind is
forged through forms of sharing and meaningful exchange (Pitt, 2018 ; Puig de la
Bellacasa, 2017 ; Valentine, 2008 ; Valentine & Sandgrove, 2014 ). Such relational and
dialogical forms of encounters –‘the co-presence of bodies in real time ’(Kester, 2011 ,
p. 114) are crucial to the work Trevor does with Canal Connections. As noted above,
young participants are involved in various forms of physical and material intervention
such as maintaining weirs and canal side trails or driving a canal boat. Yet, these are not
exercises in ‘skills development ’or navigational training for future canal boaters. Rather,
they are points of contact where individual participants are put amongst the unfamiliar
and given space and time to re ﬂect. This may result in an interest in boating, or
industrial heritage –but this is never mandated as participants are allowed to feel
their way through the course of a day (a week, or longer) and ﬁnd their own path of
correspondence. Trevor ’s work takes advantage of the particular qualities and experi-
ences the canals o ﬀer as a way of seeing what might contribute to the development of a
young person ’s interests and skills. It is through an individual ’s self-exploration with the
surrounding world where the reciprocity of care becomes evident. In Leeds, young
people involved with Canal Connections emerge as new caring agents for a derelict
landscape. Yet, it is within these spaces and through these experiences that Trevor sees
people moving out of their own di ﬃcult personal situations associated with urban
deprivation. For Canal Connections, blue spaces can have a signi ﬁcant role to play in
the well-being of marginalised and disadvantaged young people. In this case, well-being
is not measured in terms of physical or mental health, but rather by how the destabilis-
ing e ﬀects of the unfamiliar can lead to the production and genesis of desire for
alternative futures (Amin & Thrift, 2013 ; Braidotti, 2013 ). Atkinson and Scott ( 2015 ,
p. 78) note how creative destabilisation of the everyday can ‘act as a catalyst for change ’
by opening participants up to new experiences and possibilities. Similarly, research by
Wyles et al. ( 2017 ) on the impacts of beach cleans showed how meaningful engagement
with the environment can produce positive changes in the behaviour of volunteers.
However, without reinforcement, these intentions tend to be relatively short-lived (e.g.
lasting only a week). Recognising this type of limitation, Trevor noted that in a perfect
world, people who come through Canal Connections would stay on for several weeks
and eventually could become mentors or the instructors themselves.5Yet, longer
engagements are often limited by the nature of Canal Connections ’funding, particularly
funds for young o ﬀenders, which generally only support short-term encounters. Trevor
reﬂected on these situations from his experience:1052 M. BUSER ET AL.
So we actually gave somebody something that they didn ’t have before and then took it
away from them which actually puts them further down the chain when they actually do
that. (TR 9/11/16)
In these cases, canal boat encounters might actually lead to further frustration, anger
and disillusionment amongst participants. This demonstrates how, following Pitt ( 2018 ),
simply enabling encounters with nature (or the unfamiliar) does not seem to be
suﬃcient to facilitate change. Rather, transformation requires some subsequent poten-
tial for the meaningful and thoughtful application of new concepts and practices.
In London, Active Energy seeks to provide opportunities for durational encounters
with water. Research suggests that poor social relations can lead to a number of physical
and mental health impairments (Luanaigh & Lawlor, 2008 ). According to the O ﬃce for
National Statistics, in 2017 there were over 3.8 million people over 65 years of age living
alone in the UK.6As such, there is growing concern about their quality of life and the
susceptibility of older people to episodes of social isolation and loneliness (Milligan
et al., 2016 ; White, de Sousa et al., 2011 ). Yet, as Milligan et al. ( 2016 ) have shown,
increased social interaction can lead to improvements in mental health and well-being
of older people. Working with Loraine, Age UK and local volunteers, the Geezers have
met regularly over the last 10 years to work on energy-oriented projects in East London.
As such, Loraine ’s work with Active Energy provides a crucial form of care for older men.
Yet, the care ﬂows are not unidirectional. The Geezers are not typically represented as
care receivers, but rather, as agents of change and urban transformation –individuals
who hope to leave a mark on the world and make it a better place. At the stream wheel
launch event (May 2017), Jane Caldwell, Chief Executive at Age UK East London empha-
sised the value of older people ’s experience to the wider society, together with the
beneﬁts of creative and purposeful activities to those involved. As Loraine noted, ‘those
guys have a real desire for legacy and. . .for putting what they know, and their experi-
ence into something that happens that will a ﬀect people in the future ’(LL 18/10/16).
Over the last few years, this altruism has turned to improving the water quality of
London ’s Bow Creek. This tributary of the River Lea is prone to pollution from sewage
during heavy rain events which results in extremely low levels of oxygen and the death
ofﬁsh. The Geezers ’stream wheel helps address this problem by oxygenating the
watercourse through the sustainable energ y. The wheel operates on tidal power as it
blows air into areas of the tidal basin where there are low levels of oxygen. It is a form
of correspondence between the Geez ers and nonhuman lives as Bow Creek ﬁsh have
come to depend on the care of humans for a cleaner and healthier ecosystem. This is a
concept of water that includes humans within it (see Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ,p .1 9 2 )
and sees human involvement in the care for blue space as essential. Speaking at the
launch event, one of the Geezers re ﬂected on the group ’s inquisitive approach ‘we
want to do things like this and ﬁnd out about the world around us ’(Participant, 3/
5/17).
Of course, the impact of a single oxygenating wheel on London ’s riverine ecosystem
is likely to be somewhat limited. Indeed, this work is necessary only due to a widespread
lack of care and an overall disregard of the environment by others. As of yet, the Geezers
and Active Energy have not yet pushed their message for a cleaner water system out
towards the polluters. The challenge here is largely infrastructural as London ’s VictorianSOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1053
sewer design allows sewage to enter the city ’s waterways during large storms (the city is
working to address this challenge along the Thames through e ﬀorts such as the so-
called ‘super sewer ’). Yet, for Loraine and the Geezers, it is perhaps more signi ﬁcant that
new and multiple forms of social and material relating have been constructed. In this
way, the water wheel is a provocation. For some who visit the site, it is possible that the
wheel may be overlooked. Yet others might take notice and ask: why is such a device
needed? Or, how can we live in such a way that the city ’s water is safe for all? These are
questions that, while not answered directly through Active Energy, can become part of
an everyday discourse about urban rivers.
Indeed, all three examples have provided o pportunities to care for the environment.
Yet, even within programmes of direct envir onmental engagement (e.g. nature walks
or gardening), social (i.e. human) relations can be key to developing sensitivity to
nonhuman issues (Pitt, 2018 ;R o e&B u s e r , 2016 ). In this sense, we can see how Trevor,
Hugh and Loraine have also facilitated an d nurtured enabling place encounters (Du ﬀ,
2012 ) and opportunities for intimate human –human interactions in order to stimulate
and support quality relations with nonhuman s. Transformation, in this sense, involves
seeing oneself as part of an ecology of care that celebrates people ’s ability to learn
from and support one another as well as from their entanglements with more-than-
human others.
In summary, our analysis of these projects points to asymmetrical, non-linear and
distributed forms of care practices that challenge conventional framings of care as the
direct and dependent relations associated with (human) care giver and (human) care
receiver. Indeed, interdependencies abound. Moreover, we see the various bene ﬁts of
blue space as emergent and relational, situated within the entanglement of interactions
with other human and nonhuman beings.
Conclusion
In this concluding section, we re ﬂect on the forms of change and transformation these
forms of care might produce before summarising the paper. Crucially here, none of our
partners expressed interest in calculating the immediate impacts of these practices.
While funding organisations often seek demonstrable proof, Trevor, Hugh and Loraine
each resisted quanti ﬁcations of their work. Hugh of MFMC, perhaps the most skills-
oriented of the three, noted that the impacts of a young person ’s involvement might be
visible over a 10-year time horizon. Evidence of change was most commonly presented
via stories and narratives of individual change. As such, when we asked our partners to
explain the impact of their programmes, they each regularly expressed a belief that
there were aspects of this work that simply could not (and should not) be measured.
So, what can we possibly know about how lives are transformed from these kinds of
non-pragmatic, non-linear care activities? We suggest that to understand the transfor-
mational nature of these forms of intervention requires a shift in perspective. Rather
than see these projects as ‘skills development ’or eﬀorts to reduce isolation, we interpret
them as durational modes of inquiry where working with water (and others) can lead to
moments of di ﬀraction. Like the bending of light as it passes through an object –what
comes out the other side is transformed (Barad, 2007 ). In this way, involvement with
Trevor, Hugh and Loraine produces interference –the introduction of a new noise or an1054 M. BUSER ET AL.
obstacle which goes on to in ﬂuence future trajectories. Di ﬀraction and interference set
up the possibilities for lines of ﬂight (Deleuze & Guattari, [ 1980 ] 1988) and the possibi-
lities for change and transformation.
This form of change is paralleled in thinking about the role of art in socially engaged and
collaborative arts practices. According to Loraine, ‘art changes the world by facilitating
public discourse, something new, some new ideas are brought out into the open ’(LL 18/11/
16). All three partners talked about producing something ‘new ’and encouraging ways of
thinking and caring di ﬀerently. As Trevor explained, ‘what we are doing is creating a space
for people to have a conversation ’(TR 9/11/16). Crucially, this is a form of conversing that
not only involves people but also extends to the nonhuman (e.g. built form of canals and
harbours, the ﬁsh of Bow Creek) whose ‘voice ’is nurtured into the fold of experience. This,
we argue is where much of the a ﬀective power and disruptive potential of the encounters
we narrate comes from. Grant Kester suggests that collaborative arts practice is well situated
to challenge the status quo, to ‘open space for forms of knowledge that challenge cognitive,
social or political conventions ’(2011 , p. 11). Similarly, Atkinson and Scott ( 2015 , p. 89) note
how altering everyday ‘material arrangements ’(in this case, the classroom) can disrupt and
unsettle and lead to ‘a more open space of possibility ’.
Precisely how (or when) this occurs is unclear; there is nothing certain and there are
no guarantees. Indeed, positive encounters and bene ﬁcial experiences with and in blue
space are not universal. As Thomas ( 2015 ) points out, social expectations regarding body
type and image can result in the exclusion of marginalised individuals from blue spaces
(e.g. larger bodies from the beach) as well as produce anxiety and distress. However,
what we learned from encounters with our partners was that each believed that water
provided a frame through which it is possible to increase sensitivity to the world and to
expose and support forms of reciprocity and mutual care that make up everyday
existences.
Crucially here, forms of environmental citizenship promoted in Canal Connections,
MFMC, and Active Energy are not reliant on rights and responsibilities or exchanges
based in social contracts. Rather, these projects work by highlighting the interdepen-
dencies of care within which we are all ensnared. Through careful and purposeful
facilitation, participants ‘take the waters ’of blue spaces where caring with human and
nonhuman others is not a responsibility, but is a condition of life. If we imagine care as a
form of correspondence with the world –if social and environmental change means
‘watching, listening and feeling –broadly paying attention to what the world has to tell
us’(Ingold, 2013 , p. 1), these practices demonstrate how such correspondence might
play out in watery contexts. This is signi ﬁcant, we argue, because by understanding how
care works –as more-than-human, embodied and interdependent –we forge a path
towards more ecologically sensitive ways of being with the world.
In this paper, we have contributed to understandings of how care works by examin-
ing three cases of water-based socially engaged practice. Following Du ﬀ(2012 ), our
intent was to draw attention to the contexts and resources that contributed to land-
scapes of care. We suggested that these were relational and more-than-human forms of
co-production. Moreover, within our cases, we found an important role for sensory and
embodied practice (touching, making and other forms of hands-on work with the non-
familiar) in the production of caring bodies. Our work also underscored the interdepen-
dent and entangled forms of care present and how these contribute to the quality ofSOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 1055
relating within each project. We see the paper as contributing to social research in three
key ways. First, we have expanded how we might understand water and nonhumans in
the construction of particular caring landscapes. This includes not only the materiality of
water itself, but the surrounding and associated built form. Second, we have taken the
literature on blue space forward by identifying and connecting the bene ﬁts of these
sites and encounters beyond the human. Third, we argue that these projects point to
forms of engagement and education that might lead to the construction of more caring
forms of citizenship so urgently needed in times of great ecological change and crisis.
Notes

taken on the role of nurturing and facilitating caring encounters rather than participants. As
such, we make no claims that participants are experiencing care in the way suggested by
these care agents.
