Human-Managed Soils and
Soil-Managed Humans: An Interactive
Account of Perspectival Realism for Soil
Management

Abstract: What is philosophically interesting about how soil is managed and
categorized? This paper begins by investigating how diﬀerent soil ontologies
develop and change as they are used within diﬀerent social communities.
Analyzing empirical evidence from soil science, ethnopedology, sociology,
and agricultural extension reveals that eﬀorts to categorize soil are not
limited to current scientiﬁc soil classiﬁcations but also include those based in
social ontologies of soil. I examine three of these soil social ontologies: (1)
local and Indigenous classiﬁcations farmers and farming communities use to
conceptualize their relationships with soil in their ﬁelds; (2) categorizations
ascribed to farmers in virtue of their agricultural goals and economic priorities
relied upon in sociological research; and (3) federal agency classiﬁcations of
land capability employed by agricultural scientists. Studying the interplay of
these social ontologies shows how assessing soil properties and capabilities are
the result of previous agricultural strategies informed by culture, agroecological
history, weather, soil biodiversity, crop rotation, and the goals held by decision-
makers. The paper then identiﬁes the soil relationships and interactions that

a novel interactive account of perspectival realism grounded in agricultural
extension research and ethnopedological data that captures the haptic nature
of farmers’ soil strategies. This interactive account explains how ontologies
are chosen, why they are chosen, and how they interact and inform soil
management decision-making. The paper concludes by examining the values
laden in these ontologies and those which are causally implicated in the choice
of soil management strategies.

1. INTRODUCTION
What is philosophically interesting about how soil is managed and categorized?
The argument of this paper is that whatever soil is thought to be is informed
by historical, cultural, and technological interactions which reciprocally shape
both soil and humans over generations. These interactions determine how soil
is or should be classiﬁed and informs decisions about its management. As
such, soil categorizations are not limited to current scientiﬁc soil classiﬁcations
but include at least three interacting kinds of social ontologies. These
interacting social ontologies include (1) regional, local, and Indigenous
classiﬁcations diﬀerent farmers and farming communities use to conceptualize
their relationships with soil in their ﬁelds; (2) federal agency classiﬁcations of
land capability employed by agricultural scientists; and (3) the categorizations
ascribed to farmers in virtue of their agricultural goals and economic priorities
that are employed in sociological research.
Which of these social ontologies is used within a particular context
is often determined according to particular cultural practices, agroecological
planning goals, or sociological research interests. Rather than conceiving of
these social ontologies as isolated, the aim of this paper is to examine their
interplay.
To do this, the ﬁrst section introduces the reader to farmer-focused soil
ontologies whilst also explaining why classifying farmers’ soil management
strategies is a valuable endeavor. It then turns to a discussion of the social
ontologies used within agricultural and sociological research. Through a series
of case studies, it analyses how the ontologies farmers use, and those that
CATHERINE KENDIG 82
agricultural researchers use, arise out of agricultural research and agricultural
practices farmers employ. It traces the processes by which soil social ontologies
are formed, how these ontologies lead to further interactions with soil which
then reshape and revise these ontologies in light of these soil relationships and
interactions. The second half of the paper identiﬁes what it is about these
soil relationships and interactions that constitute ontologizing, or ontology-
making, activities. An outline for what I call an “interactive account of
perspectivism” follows. I conclude, showing how this interactive account
explains how ontologies are chosen, why they are chosen, and how they
interact and inform soil management decision-making in diﬀerent value-laden
situations.
2. FARMERS’ SOIL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND THE
ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES USED TO ASSESS THEM
How do the ontologies that are employed in farm management decision-
making arise? In this section, I begin by explaining why soil management is
important globally and locally before brieﬂy discussing how the diﬀerences
in soil types and local agroecological environments impact farmers’ planting
choices. By examining research on farmers’ decisions in Northern Ethiopia
and the Midwest United States, I investigate how the ontological categories
that farmers rely upon emerge from social and agroecological interactions with
the soil.
Why is soil management important? Farming relies on good soil for
plants to grow and is an essential part of the food system. But soil erosion,
reduced organic matter content, declining biodiversity, degraded organism
habitat, salinization, alkalinization, and chemical contamination make growing
food, ﬁber, and fuel diﬃcult for farmers and impact both local and global food
systems (FAO 2017;2023; USDA 2023).
Finding strategies for sustainable farming that support soils is a concern
of worldwide importance. The United Nations declared 2015 the International
Year of Soils and in 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
drafted the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management (VGSSM)
in response to the global need. What exactly is sustainable soil management?
According to the FAO and, in particular, the World Soil Charter which drafted
the VGSSM:
Soil management is sustainable if the supporting, provisioning,
regulating, and cultural services provided by soil are maintained or
enhanced without signiﬁcantly impairing either the soil functions
83 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
that enable those services or biodiversity. The balance between the
supporting and provisioning services for plant production and the
regulating services the soil provides for water quality and availability
and for atmospheric greenhouse gas composition is a particular concern
(FAO 2017, 3).
The World Soil Charter deﬁnition, which remains in use (FAO 2023), provides
an intentionally open-textured language that requires interpretation to be
applied. This is because soil isn’t the same everywhere and neither are farms
and farmers. Soils vary in their texture, chemical, and organic composition
as well as in their moisture content, conduciveness as a habitat for soil micro-
and macro-organisms, porosity, aeration, parent material (the geologic material
from which the soil formed), temperature, and the amount of vegetative cover
on the soil surface. In soil science, there are twelve orders of soils that are used
to classify soils according to their common properties (e.g. Alﬁsols, Gelisols,
Vertisols) which are each subdivided into suborders, great groups, subgroups,
families, and series (FAO 2023). Ethnopedological soil name types, as well
as commonly and locally used names for soils, are widespread ( Tegene ,1998;
Barrera-Bassols and Zinck ,2003;Nyssen et al. ,2008;Ludwig ,2016). Farmers’
soil management strategies vary not only in response to soil type but also to
environmental and cultural factors that inform their decisions and in turn
reshape the agroecological environment within which they farm. The ways
in which diﬀerent qualities and relationships with soil interact in farmers’
management decisions has been the focus of ongoing research. A series of
recent studies in the Tigray Highlands, Dogu’a Tembien district, in Northern
Ethiopia show that:
soil colour, texture and workability are important criteria for farmers,
[reﬂected] in the local soil classiﬁcation systems, and aid choice of soil
fertility strategies [...] Walka (Vertisol, Vertic Cambisol): black heavy
clay that cracks in the dry season but is waterlogging in the rainy season.
Baekhel: light soils that were light coloured on limestone (Calcaric
Regosol and Cambisol, Luvisol on siliciﬁed limestone), Andel: dark
brown coloured loamy textured soil (Cumulicalcaric Regosol) (Nyssen
et al.2008, 267-8).
Smallholder farmers in Dogu’a Tembien relied on “the interaction between
environmental and social factors” in combining knowledge of local soil types,
and historically informed crop rotation methods to inform their land use
decisions. For instance, deciding whether to use the soils in rain-fed crop
CATHERINE KENDIG 84
production, to leave fallow or irrigate, as well as determining crop rotations:
wheat, barley or hanfets, then horse beans; teﬀ, grass pea, wheat, then barley
or hanfets; or wheat, barley or hanfets, lentils, grass peas, then left fallow, or if
there are early rains then planting maize or sorghum (Nyssen et al 2008, 261).
Research on farmers’ management decisions in the Midwest of the
United States show irrigation, drainage, and access to either too much
or too little water is a substantial factor inﬂuencing soil management
decisions ( Morton et al. ,2017).1If a farmer suﬀers a drought, they often decide
to adopt sloping land management while farmers whose soil is waterlogged
tend to manage their soil by implementing grass waterways and clearing
drainage ditches (Morton et al. 2017, 27). Midwest farmers adopt diﬀerent
crop rotations, including corn—soybean; corn—winter wheat or red clover
(cover crop)—soybeans in response to weather conditions. Other inﬂuences
include soil types like the clayey Gumbo (Solonetzic) or Kickapoo (Udiﬂuvents),
soil moisture level, and whether they choose to use cover crops (Wang et
al.2020, 3-5). Crop rotation is also implemented as a weed management
strategy. In the Midwest, farmers often rely on herbicides, but when weeds, like
pigweed (Palmer Amaranth) survive treatments, farmers seek a combination of
solutions to cope with the herbicidal (e.g., Glyphosate) resistant weeds (Burgos
et al.2006, 3). In addition to crop rotation, farmers also rotate their herbicides
so that they use herbicides with diﬀerent modes of action in diﬀerent years to
manage crops (Burgos et al. 2006, 3-4).2
Knowing what soil types exist in a ﬁeld provides knowledge of potential
importance to soil management decisions. But because soil management
requires knowledge not only of soil type but also of drainage, irrigation, slope,
previously planted crops, organic soil biodiversity, crop rotation history, and
the history of soil amendments applied to ﬁelds (and in what quantities),
farmers’ local knowledge is central. In a recent study of farmers’ approaches to
soil stewardship, and responses to weather-related risks and conservation goals,
Roesch-McNally and colleagues ( Roesch-McNally et al. ,2017) interviewed
159 Midwest farmers from nine states about their choice to use till or no-till
strategies to improve soil resilience:
1The farmers in the study primarily farmed either medium-sales small family farms
or large family farms. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, farms are
categorized as “medium-sales small family farms” if their gross annual sales are between
$150,0002 and $349,999 and “large family farm” if $350,000 to $699,999 ( Hoppe and
MacDonald ,2013 ).
2An herbicide’s “mode of action” refers to how the herbicide affects the plant’s physiology
by interfering with growth. For instance, Glyphosate’s mode of action is via EPSP Synthase
Inhibitors (Burgos et al. 2006 , 2).
85 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
We seem to be having these extremes from one year to the next. Like this
year it was way too wet. Last year, it was plenty dry. The year before that,
it was cold and wet, initially, and then it got too dry after that. I guess
you just need to be ﬂexible. Obviously, you can’t do anything about the
rain but, [...] you [can not] work your ground to death and [...] leave
residue on the ground. No-tilling [farming is] what you’re going to [do
to] conserve more moisture than if it’s wide open and getting baked by
the sun (Michigan farmer, quoted in Roesch-McNally et al. 2017, 12).
I tried to no-till and some of our soils are just really wet and heavy and
they don’t warm up in the spring and I’ve just found that [with] the deep
tillage, over the years, you certainly get a yield bump from the tillage
because you’re loosening the soil. (Missouri farmer, quoted in Roesch-
McNally et al. 2017, 13).
The Michigan and Missouri farmers did not agree on what good soil is
(undisturbed or wet and loose) or how to manage it (no-till vs deeper tillage).
Their responses represent some of the diﬀerent strategies and considerations
used by farmers in the United States’ Midwest Corn Belt, all of whom relied
on corn-based cropping systems (Roesch-McNally et al. 2017, 14-6).
2.1. Categorizing farmers’ perspectives, identities, and decision-making
strategies
Analyses of interview data, such as the data presented in the previous
section, show that agricultural researchers categorize farmers’ soil management
strategies as being “conservationist” or “productionist” (more on this below).
Researchers classify farmers as belonging to one of these categories in virtue of
how farmers’ agricultural goals and economic priorities inﬂuence their long-
and short-term planting and irrigation decisions.
Empirical evidence from soil science ( Klingebiel and Montgomery ,
1961;Janzen et al. ,2021), ethnopedology ( Tegene ,1998;Nyssen et al. ,2008),
philosophy ( Puig De La Bellacasa ,2015), sociology ( Morton et al. ,2017),
and agricultural extension research ( Roesch-McNally et al. ,2017) reveal that
gaining an understanding of what makes good soil and soil management
requires attending to soils’ biological and physical attributes, the ecology of
farms, the cultures of farmers (and their communities), as well as the categories
that are employed within these eﬀorts.3
3The FAO has itself published numerous bulletins and practical resource tools for farmers
and extension workers related to specific countries in terms of their soil nutrient profiles
CATHERINE KENDIG 86
As the descriptions of farmers’ soil management strategies above show,
weather, season, soil type, soil organic biodiversity, crop rotation, ecological
history of the land and community, local knowledge, and culture are just
some factors that contribute to farmers’ perspectives. Categorizing farmers’
perspectives allows researchers to analyze diﬀerent ways that farmers make
decisions about soil and how these inﬂuence their management strategies.
One might ask, “Why is ontological category-making important?” A response
might be that categorization is part of the experimental methods employed in
analyzing data. Nevertheless, one might still press, “Ok, so why might studying
these ontological categories be important?” Studying categories in agriculture
is important because the choice of categories shapes what is known as well as
how it is known—that is, it shapes the epistemological and methodological
results that are arrived at utilizing those ontological categories.
Research attending to the ecological and cultural aspects of soil
management often entails the positing or constructing of social ontologies,
identities, and perspectives. Diﬀerent ontological categories are used to frame
the way in which ecological and cultural relationships are evaluated. Grounded
theory approaches, where data are collected and analyzed—and from this, a
theory or ontology is generated—are common in agricultural research. For
instance, the earlier mentioned interdisciplinary study by Roesch-McNally and
colleagues ﬁrst conducted in-depth interviews with farmers in the Corn Belt
to identify how farmers discuss their approaches to soil and sustainability in
response to extreme weather conditions. The researchers concluded on the basis
of their analyses, that the ways in which farmers conceptualize their agricultural
goals, values, and priorities is according to a “soil stewardship ethic” (Roesch-
McNally et al. 2017, 3). The soil stewardship ethic forms a perspectival stance
that shapes farmers’ management decisions. Such a stance includes approaches
to weather-related risks, social relationships in their community (including
observing neighboring farmers’ practices), and the weighing of short-term goals
(like high seasonal yields) and long-term goals (like saving and building up
soil for future generations) (Roesch-McNally et al. 2017, 4-5). In a separate
study, sociologists Morton and colleagues ( Morton et al. ,2017), relying on
data from a 2012 survey of 4778 Midwest farmers, analyzed the adaptive
management strategies that farmers chose in response to soil degradation. The
researchers identiﬁed where farmers had expressed control over the biophysical
situation of their farmland and where farmers’ expressed beliefs and values
(FAO 2022 ), literature directed to the needs of smallholder farmers and local agri-food
systems (FAO 2021 ), as well as studies devoted to intersectional issues of agriculture, gender,
and sustainable soil management (FAO 2019 ).
87 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
in their perception of their identity as “a good farmer” (Morton et al. 2017,
24). Analyzing the survey data, they posited two categories of farmer identities
that had the potential to inﬂuence their choice of management strategy:
“conservationist” and “productivist”; where conservationist farmers valued
long-term goals of soil resilience as well as promoting productive land, and
where productivist farmers prioritized seasonal short-term management and
focused on high yields (Morton et al. 2017, 25).
In constructing these categories, both teams of researchers relied on
earlier work that analyzed farmers’ social communities. Some of this work
(e.g. Rogers 1995) highlighted the important role played by farmers sharing
knowledge based on their observations of how new technologies worked,
or did not work, on neighbours’ adjacent ﬁelds. Farmers thus reﬂected on
how technologies might work on their ﬁelds by comparing the soil, ﬁeld
size, crop, irrigation system, treatments, and practices to those currently used
before considering whether to adopt or not adopt new technologies. Whereas
Roesch-McNally and colleagues’ categorization of farmer’s decision-making
perspectives in terms of a “soil stewardship ethics” emphasized the reﬂective
and social character of farmer-evaluated risks and strategies (including both
short-term and long-term planning), Morton and colleagues’ “conservationist”
and “productivist” categorizations of farmer identities emphasized a more static
account of farmers decision-making perspectives. Identities are “activated” in
management decisions, revealing their values and beliefs (Morton et al. 2017,
19;cf.Verplanken and Holland 2002).
2.2. Rethinking categorizations of land capability and ontologies of soil
management strategies
Are ontologies ﬁxed? Do they develop, and if so, how do they develop
and change? In this section, I examine how an historical ontology of soil
management, devised by a U.S. federal agency, was reinterpreted through the
expert knowledge of culturally and agroecologically informed management
practices used by communities in the Ethiopian Highlands. The case study
illustrates how soil ontological categories interact with community-based
expert knowledge to inform normative assessments of good farming practices.
Categorization of soil management relies on other categorizations made
by previous researchers. One of these, widely cited in research on soil
management worldwide, is the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) “Land-Capability Classiﬁcation” ( Klingebiel and Montgomery ,
1961). This aimed to provide a classiﬁcation of soil by grouping soil into
CATHERINE KENDIG 88
categories based on their use and management, as they call them: “capability
units, subclasses and classes.” It was not intended as a static system of
classiﬁcation but as one that required interpretations that allowed for it to
make sense to the user. Information concerning the kinds of soil present in
the ﬁeld, what the farmer intends to do with them, and which crop varieties
are either anticipated or have been planted, is required to make sense of
the classiﬁcation ( Klingebiel and Montgomery ,1961). Not intended for use
outside the U.S., it only speciﬁed capability categories that reﬂected U.S.-
based environmental conditions and management practices. For instance, it
categorized Class III soils as those with
severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or require special
conservation practices, or both [...] limitations of class III soils restrict
the amount of cultivation: timing of planting, tillage [...] resulting from
(1) moderately steep slopes; (2) high susceptibility to water or wind
erosion,” and Class IV soils as those with “very severe limitations [...]
requir[ing] very careful management [and limited] as a result of (1)
steep slopes, (2) severe susceptibility to water or wind erosion, (3) severe
eﬀects of past erosion (Klingebiel and Montgomery 1961, 8).
Despite the US-focus, the 1961 Land-Capability Classiﬁcation has been
modiﬁed to ﬁt diﬀerent agricultural regions both within and outside the U.S.
by taking into consideration local environment and local farming practices,
and the ecological-cultural histories of generations of farmers’ management
strategies. For example, in developing a conservation planning framework for
the Northern Ethiopian Highlands ( Belay Tegene ,2003), the Land-Capability
Classiﬁcation is ﬁrst modiﬁed and then combined with GIS and local cultural
conservation technologies. Soil loss from tillage is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the
Northern Ethiopian Highlands than in the U.S. as it is impacted by several
intersecting factors: soil eroded by runoﬀ, tillage by ox-drawn plough (causing
downward transfer of large masses of soil), as well as the history of local
indigenous soil management strategies to manage erosion. Importantly, soil
conservation plans that do not take into consideration both ox-drawn tillage
erosion and the history of indigenous soil management techniques, are not
applicable to land use in the Highlands (Belay Tegene 2003, 24). Including
the biophysical and cultural conditions within a land capability classiﬁcation
meant inclusion of speciﬁc eﬀects and causes of erosion and indigenous soil
practices. A modiﬁed “treatment-oriented” land capability classiﬁcation was
then mooted before being further evaluated and modiﬁed (Belay Tegene 2003,
25).
89 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
The treatment-oriented classiﬁcation recommends that the cultivable
cropland categories be treated with broad- or narrow-based terraces,
bench terraces, hexagons, mini-convertible terraces and hillside ditch-
ing. However, the history of conservation in Ethiopia clearly indi-
cates that imported technologies, such as those mentioned above, have,
in most cases, failed to win the acceptance of farmers. These non-
indigenous soil conservation technologies failed [... because of] their
demand for a huge labour force for their construction and mainte-
nance, that they put large areas of land out of production, encourage the
spread of weeds, provide shelter for rodents, etc. [... and] the treatment-
oriented scheme assumes construction of the recommended measures
by machines, the realities of the northern Ethiopian highlands dictate
that they be carried out by manual labour (Belay Tegene 2003, 29-30)
The treatment-oriented classiﬁcation is found unsuitable without modiﬁcation
with the inclusion of several indigenous conservation techniques including
contour ploughing and the construction of a weber. Contour ploughing is
practiced on steep terrain which produces furrows within which water collects
and slowly ﬁlters into the soil, thereby reducing erosion (Belay Tegene 2003,
42-3). A weber is a semi-permanent terrace structure which is comprised of
a series of discontinuous embankments and terraces ( Tegene ,1998). In high
terrain regions, kaborkiritare built with stone walls and embankments to
prevent runoﬀ from steeper slopes ( Tegene ,1998;Assefa and Bork ,2014).
Building weber, kab orkiritis a community activity as they require a lot
of manual labor. Groups of ﬁve to ﬁfteen people make up a debowhich is the
social group of neighbors and relatives,
the owner [of the terrace ] is expected to collect stones and put them at
diﬀerent places of the farm ﬁeld [prior to] construction [...] the owner
also prepares food and drinks to serve the [ debo]. Before the group starts
to construct the terrace, some ritual activities are conducted to ensure
the longevity of the terrace (Assefa and Bork 2014, 937).
The agricultural and cultural history of indigenous soil management also shapes
the normative categories of what is a “good farmer.” In surveys and interviews
with farmers and elders, a good farmer is one that takes care of the terraces,
“a person who does not maintain or construct terraces on his farmland is
considered a lazy farmer [... and] the community may ﬁne or cast out the person
from social interaction” (Assefa and Bork 2014, 940).
CATHERINE KENDIG 90
The cultural practice of building weber, kab and kiritfor soil
management and the structuring of communities and values has a long history
in the Ethiopian Highlands. Separate research conducted in Chencha-Dorze
Belle, relying on both household surveys and interviews with elders, attests
to the cultural history of stone-walled terraces ( Assefa and Bork ,2014). Oral
histories shared from elders in Chencha-Dorze Belle as well as other parts of
Chencha indicate that the terraces were “as old as the agricultural activities in
[Chencha-Dorze Belle] and their ancestors were the ones who designed and
constructed the terraces [...] the cultural landscape passed from one generation
to another” (Assefa and Bork 2014, 937). In addition to the oral histories
shared by the elders, ﬁeld data from archaeological research has supplemented
research on the cultural history of indigenous soil conservation practices. Kab
andkiritare often constructed with terrace walls that are ﬁlled using local
materials, for example, with stones and wood charcoal (Assefa and Bork 2014,
935). Recent archaeological research uncovered several pieces of charcoal in
the remains of terrace walls. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating of
charcoal located 30 centimeters below the soil surface suggested a radiocarbon
age of 795 +/- 30 BP (Laboratory No. KIA41856), aged at 1186-1202 and
1206-1277 (Assefa and Bork 2014, 936).
Overall, it is particularly striking to note the diﬀerent categorizations
of farmers and farmer soil management practices that are made. The above
has recorded at least ﬁve: the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable
Soil Management, the USDA Land-Capability Classiﬁcation, soil scientists’
construction of the “soil stewardship ethic,” social scientists’ categorization
of farmer identities into “conservationist” and “productivist”; and a single
case study representative of a much larger body of farmer-centered and self-
identiﬁed categorizations of farmers’ cultural identity and soil management
practices.4In the farmer- and culture-focused categorizations, the history of
culturally based soil management practices, as well as the historically made
and remade agroecologies within which farmers maintained their agricultural
practices, was centered in the categorizations of soil management strategies,
land capability classiﬁcations, and normative categories of what it means to
be a good farmer. Cultural practices and a farmer-centered approach to soil
4Farmer identity has been captured in the survey data in several ways that have included
both socioeconomic group, culture, and self-identification as a “good farmer,” but also in
terms of farmers’ identifying through their belonging to a category of farmer, e.g., their
identity as a dairy farmer, “I am a dairy farmer and always will be … [dairy farming] is a
way of life, our way of life” (Warren et al. 2016 2016, 9). Identity has also been linked how
farmers view themselves in light of what they think is the purpose of their farming, e.g., “food
production [is] the moral purpose of farming” (Raman et al., 2015 2015, 57).

and land capability have social, ecological, and agricultural impacts insofar
as they redeﬁne what is capable land, agriculturally productive soil, good soil
management practices, well-maintained farms, and good farmers.
One example of this farmer-focused categorization/recategorization
process of land, soil, practice, farm, and farmers is in the revised soil capability
classiﬁcations that can be found in Assefa and Bork’s ( 2014) and Belay Tegene’s
(2003), which eﬀectively recategorized Class III and IV soils in the original US-
based “Land-Capability Classiﬁcation” of Klingebiel and Montgomery (1961).
Originally categorized as soils that were deﬁned as having either severe or very
severe limitations due to their steep slopes (Klingebiel and Montgomery 1961,
8), Class III and IV soils were recategorized as soil that is more ﬁt for
agricultural purposes when evaluated for its agricultural capacity in the
Ethiopian Highlands given its unique ecological-cultural history of indigenous
soil management practices that made the soil agriculturally suitable through
the histories of terrace-building. What was also revealed in the process of this
recategorization was how attendant farmer and community-led categorizations
relied upon categorizing farms in terms of well-maintained terraces and good
farmers as those who built and maintained terraces within their communities
as part of their culturally and ecologically based soil management strategies.
Studying both how soil conservation methods are evaluated, as well as
the ontological categorizations that are employed in studying the management
strategies of farmers in diﬀerent agricultural communities, provides the means
by which the diﬀerent suites of ecologically and socially embedded values
and practices interact and shape farmers’ choices. Doing so directs attention
to the ways diﬀerent categorizations shape how farmers’ interactions with
the soil are characterized in the study of them. Analyzing the ontological
perspectives and categorizations employed provides the means by which they
can be judged to be apt for the purposes employed, and whether they
reﬂect the relationships, practices, and interactions that exist. In doing so,
it also provides the opportunity to reconﬁgure the social and ecological
categories employed in multiple ways and for multiple communities. Critically
revising the institutionally designed USDA soil capability ontologies, farming
communities in the Northern Ethiopian Highlands provided soil capability
ontologies that were informed by their own expert knowledge of generations of
soil care. This community informed reconﬁguring of soil ontological categories
also has signiﬁcant epistemological and social implications for agricultural
scientists as well. The community-led reconﬁguring of practice-based soil
capability ontologies has the potential to change the ways in which soil
management and soil crises are framed and studied within the agricultural
CATHERINE KENDIG 92
sciences, by correcting problematic categorizations and the value assumptions
that underpin them.
Soil degradation is frequently discussed as being the result of poor
management, a problem that needs urgent ﬁxing (FAO 2013). In “Making
time for soil: Technoscientiﬁc futurity pace of care,” Puig de la Bellacasa argues
that treating soil management as a “temporal emergency” of soil degradation
relies on “productionist” framings of soil management that are problematically
reductive (Puig de la Bellacasa 2015, 692-3). Describing how soil care is treated
as a temporal emergency, she writes:
The future of soils appears pulled forward by an accelerated timeline
towards a gloomy environmental future, while the present time left
for action is compressed by urgency [...] consistent with a hegemony
of future oriented timelines [...] of technoscientiﬁc futurity that
associates the future with progress, with an ethico-political imperative
to ‘advance’ that remains solidly ‘progressivist’ timelines—while the past
acts as a discriminatory signiﬁer of developmental delay (Puig de la
Bellacasa 2015, 694).
The idea Puig de la Bellacasa captures here is that technoscience and new
strategies will be what saves soil, not past practices. The technoscientiﬁc
futurity of soil degradation both categorizes the problem and preemptively
prescribes the only solution whilst simultaneously devaluing historical and
cultural practices. The problematic nature of the technoscientiﬁc futurity
ontology has been described as one where anticipation of the technology ﬁx
is one of permanent anxiety where what we have in the present is “contingent
on an ever-changing astral future that may or may not be known for certain
but must be acted on nonetheless” (Adams et al. 2009, 247). The problem
with productionist and technoscientiﬁc futurity ontologies is that they treat
soil management as control over soil rather than care of it (Puig de la
Bellacasa 2015, 701). Applying a feminist philosophy of care to soil, Puig de la
Bellacasa provides an alternative ontology. Soil management is recategorized
as “care work” to draw attention to practices depreciated as unscientiﬁc by
productionist ontologies: “soil labors [entail] everyday mundane maintenance,
repetitive work, [and] require regularity and task reiteration [... the] work of
care takes time and involves adjusting to the temporal exigencies of the cared-
for” (Puig de la Bellacasa 2015, 708).

3. HOW DO ONTOLOGIES DIRECT PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES AND
ARE ALSO DIRECTED BY THEM?
What the farmer, agricultural researcher, institutional, and Indigenous soil
ontologies discussed in the ﬁrst half of this paper have in common is that
they all arise out of interactions between soils, humans and their management
of soils, and the multiple ontologies they employ. These are practice-based
ontologies: ontologies that are developed and changed through the activities
of those using them. The categorizations discussed so far have had a particular
characteristic common to all of them. They involve the categorization of
ontological perspectives on soil management and identities of farmers, often
with the explicitly stated goal of understanding the bases for farmer decision-
making around soil management, and the assessment of land in terms of
its agricultural potential given the application of diﬀerent soil management
strategies. Each carves the world up into diﬀerent ontological categories that
are employed for a purpose. How they do this and what resources they
rely upon to ground these categorizations matters. Farmers’ own ontological
categorizations may be felt and expressed by farmers in ways that coincide,
partially coincide with, or diﬀer from those circumscribed by soil science, social
science, governmental or non-governmental research. Examining practices and
processes that contribute to the making of these ontological categorizations
provides the opportunity to reconsider these ontologies and reframe them, as
the above discussion of the work of Belay Tegene, Assefa and Bork, and Puig de
la Bellacasa has shown. This is important as ontological categorizations shape
how concepts relating to soil can and should be understood.
One concept impacted by soil management categorizations is soil health.
Soil’s properties, capabilities, and anticipated future capabilities, have long
been described in terms of soil’s productivity, capability of maintaining high
crop yields, resilience to erosion, possession of high levels of biodiversity
in its soil biota, or appropriate levels of nutrients ( Lehmann et al. ,2020).
These capabilities and properties were earlier captured in the concepts of
soil fertility and soil quality (Hopkins ,1910;Letey et al. ,2003). Rather
than being based on the reproductive capacity-grounded metaphor of soil
fertility, soil health is intended to be a more holistic concept that includes
the health of soil multispecies soil complexes (e.g., soil exudate microbiome,
soil microbial community, soil rhizosphere, soil-crop-farmer relationships),
provides speciﬁcations of beneﬁcial levels of the chemical components of soil
(e.g., level of nitrogen); as well as how soil can be sick (e.g., through toxic
acidiﬁcation, salinity, phosphorus ﬁxation, or other chemical contamination)
CATHERINE KENDIG 94
(Malley 2017; EPA 2023). Because the soil health metaphor applies to so
much, it has also been criticized as not being precisely deﬁned and therefore of
less use to farmers and agronomists ( Lehmann et al. ,2020;Janzen et al. ,2021).
In their recent paper “The ‘soil health’ metaphor: illuminating or illusory?”
Janzen and colleagues oﬀer a deﬁnition of soil health as “the vitality of a soil
in sustaining the socio-ecological functions of its enfolding land” (Janzen et
al.2021, 2). They also curiously concede that, “if ‘goodness’ of soil could be
succinctly conveyed in scientiﬁc jargon, there would be no need for metaphor”
(Janzen et al. 2021, 3).
What appears to have been left out of the discussion is how the meaning
of soil health is informed by the categorizations of soil management practices,
land capability classiﬁcations, and categorizations of farmers caring for the
soil. Understanding soil in a holistic way is dependent upon understanding
it through a particular culture, soil type, management approach, history of
farming practices, historical ecologies, and past and anticipated weather events.
For instance, take the US Land-Capability Classiﬁcation. Land in Class II
is deﬁned in terms of the need for soil management due to its limitations
that may involve one or more of the following: “moderate susceptibility to
wind or water erosion or moderate adverse eﬀects of past erosion, wetness
correctable by drainage but existing permanently as a moderate limitation,
[…] slight climatic limitations on soil use and management” (Klingebiel
and Montgomery 1961, 7). A land capability classiﬁcation informs farmers’
practices of soil management whether it is the land capability categorizations
used within a farming culture or community, shared between two neighboring
farmers, or written down or mapped formally. In drought-prone environments,
cover-cropping is one practice employed for soil protection from erosion due to
wind. For those with land where both drought and waterlogging are possible,
adjusting soil moisture levels and better water ﬁltration through the mechanical
leveling of ﬁelds, the building of and maintenance of ditch or row drainage
provides measures that protect soil are practiced. As a farmer from Iowa reports:
You’re trying to think ahead and say, how can I make that soil more
resilient or able to handle the stresses [...] whether it’s a dry stress or too
much rain or something like that, you know? By having that structure
and those roots there [from using cover crops] and holding on to that
soil and maybe, hold on to more nutrients through [the winter] (Iowa
farmer, quoted in Roesch-McNally et al. 2017, 12).
If understood holistically, soil health would indeed, as the Iowa farmer
mentions, include the relationship with the roots and the soil and the
95 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
attendant root-soil complex relationships that make up what soil scientists
refer to as the soil rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is a concept that captures the
unique populations of microorganisms that are inﬂuenced by the release of
photosynthetically ﬁxed carbon from plant roots and their polysaccharide-rich
mucilage. These root exudates serve as “bait” for root pathogens and are capable
of sequestering toxic metals such as Al3+(Hawes et al. ,2000). Exudates enable
plants to request help from rhizospheric microorganisms and are capable of
changing their chemical environment in order to gain more nutrients (e.g.,
the plant will acidify the soil in order to access nutrients in the surrounding
soil (McNear ,2013). A holistic understanding of soil health would include
local weather and the eﬀects of past seasons. The speculation of the farmer and
the community and farming identities as a good steward or good farmer, a
stance that they use to inform their anticipation of how the soil in their ﬁelds
will behave in light of the diﬀerent soil management activities they choose to
use and how their neighbors have fared with their strategies (e.g., overwinter
cover cropping) would also be included.
Janzen and colleagues claim that soil health, or at least their deﬁnition of
it included above, “will always be context-dependent” (Janzen et al. 2021, 2).
While context-dependency initially sounds like an appropriate way to include
all the cultural, ecological, and historical variables in and around the networks
described as soil, the question we might ask is, “ Whyis it context dependent?”
I argue the reason is because soil health is something that is known and made
through multispecies activities that include farmer goal-oriented practices.
That is, soil health is descriptively context-dependent, because its existence is
dependent upon a network of historically embedded cultural and ecological
relationships, interactions, and practices.
3.1. An Interactive account of perspectival realism for soil management and
soil health
What does it mean for soil health to be known, made, and framed
through networks of relationships, interactions, and practices? In the previous
section, I showed how ontologies were developed and changed through the
interaction of social communities—whether farmers, agricultural researchers,
or agricultural institutions—with soil. Asking and attempting to answer how
these interactions, in general, lead to the formulation of such ontologies
occupies the remainder of the paper. The focus of the present section will be
to inquire into the nature of these interactions with and for soil that constitute
ontology-making activities. This is an important question to be addressed
CATHERINE KENDIG 96
because the answer to it tells us how concepts, like the notion of soil health
introduced in the previous section, can be known.
Research on farmers’ soil management practices, and how they describe
their interactions with soil, suggests a reconceptualization of soil health. If soil
health is to be understood as a concept grounded in farmers’ soil management
decisions and practices, then it is a concept that is best understood in practice—
through the farming cultures and histories of management, farmer identities,
land capability classiﬁcations, soil types, and soil management strategies. This
is, or so I will argue, because soil health is valued, assessed, and actualized
through culturally and historically situated farmer-focused goals and plans.
Concepts of soil health are shaped by farmers’ management strategies in
response to ecological features of the local geography and weather and within
communities and cultures. Normative assessments like soil goodness or the
wholesomeness of soil are understood from within these overlapping situated
perspectives.
As such, I contend soil health may be helpfully understood as being
inherently perspectival because it is in virtue of ecologically, geographically,
and culturally situated interactive relationships of soil-individual and soil-
community that assessments of health are made. “Perspectival,” as it is used
in philosophy, often includes reference to the partial nature of knowledge as it
is viewed from a particular point of view or standpoint. It is from such a point
of view that understanding, or seeing the world, can be discussed with regard to
the positionality of the subject (Harding 1995, 341). Positionalities, moreover,
simultaneously provide the means to understand the world while also limiting
this understanding.
In recent philosophy of science, both realists and pragmatists have
argued that scientiﬁc objects of inquiry and representation (e.g., theories,
observations, models, natural kinds) are best understood as perspectival,
meaning that these epistemic objects and processes are the sorts of things that
can be perceived from diﬀerent points of view ( Chirimuuta ,2016;Massimi ,
2022). The notion of a point of view often implies that there is a subject who
seessomething or visualizes it from their particular standpoint. When referring
to the perspectival nature of scientiﬁc theories, seeing is a frequently used
metaphor. Examples borrowed from color vision, are often used to illustrate
the partiality of what is seen. The fact that objects aren’t colored in any sort
of objective sense, but are colored only in terms of how that object is seen
or perceived by a particular observer, is an example that is commonly used.
There is no deﬁnitive color— thecolor—since color is always dependent on
one’s perceptual conﬁguration; “there is only the color of the rug as seen by a
97 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
dichromat andthe color as seen by a trichromat ” (Giere 2006, 33, emphasis
added). Recent scholarship in perspectivism pushes back against the use of
the vision metaphor. For instance, Chirimuuta ( 2016, 747-51) argues that
vision metaphors are neither the only or even the best way to understand
perspectivism and we would do better if we swapped the vision metaphors
for haptic ones. What might this shift in metaphors do? And what might
shifting to a haptic metaphor aﬀord with regard to our ability to understand
or explain something about the world? For Chirimuuta, the choice of a haptic
metaphor over a vision metaphor strengthens the perspectivist’s claim about
interactionism—that scientiﬁc knowledge relies on our active engagement with
the world rather than something that we passively collect as the world spins by:
the sense of touch requires physical contact and purposeful exploration
on the part of the perceiver, [and] it is obvious that with touch
one apprehends an external reality in virtue of and not in spite
of its interactive/interested nature. By analogy, perspectivists should
investigate the thesis that scientiﬁc representations inform us about
the natural world in virtue of their interactive and interested qualities
(Chirimuuta 2016, 749).
Thinking about the diﬀerence in how the perceiver engages with the world
using metaphors based on touch rather than vision allows us to consider the
active and purposive nature of perceiving in a way that seeing does not. What
is touched also includes an intention to understand or at least interact with a
reality that is made when interacted with.
Adapting Chirimuuta’s suggestion for use in agriculture, I will show
how conceiving of farmers’ practices using haptic metaphors captures both
the interactive nature of soil relationships and the interactions between
diﬀerent soil ontologies and social ontologies. This use is also central to
understanding the multiple positionalities of farmers in ways that visual
metaphors neglect. Using haptic metaphors for soil management directs
attention to the soil-human interactions farmers engage in when managing
soils. After discussing these haptic soil-human interactions, I outline what I’ll
refer to as an interactive account of perspectival realism for soil management
and soil health. This interactive account of perspectival realism takes realism
to be constituted in agricultural practices. It centers farmer’s practice-oriented
kind-making or kinding activities, that include farm management activities like
planting decisions such as crop rotation, irrigation and drainage, the making
and application of compost, constructing and maintaining terraces, digging
CATHERINE KENDIG 98
and clearing ditches, irrigating or draining ﬁelds, and the addition of soil
amendments that contribute to the making and remaking of the land and soil
in relation to the farmer, ecology, weather, and community.5
The haptic nature of soil-human interactions is manifest in the diﬀerent
activities collectively grouped in the category of soil management already
mentioned by farmers from both the American Midwest and the Ethiopian
Highlands. Midwest farmers’ reports described soil as something that they
work with, or that is “worked,” “fertilized,” and “plowed” (Roesch-McNally
et al.2017, 12). Feeling the wetness, dryness, weight, texture, and temperature
of the soil, provides information important to decision-making about whether
to till or not to till: “some of our soils are just really wet and heavy and they
don’t warm up,” with “deep tillage [...] loosen[s] the soil” (Roesch-McNally
et al. 2017, 13). Ethiopian Highland farmers centered descriptions of the
activities of building stone walls and embankments in response to soils at risk
of running down steeper slopes ( Tegene ,1998). The culturally-deﬁned haptic
nature of terrace-construction captures the owner’s responsibilities to the soil
and to the community of “collecting stones,” “putting them at diﬀerent places
[on] the farm ﬁeld” for the debo,as well as “prepar[ing] food and drinks to serve
the [debo]” prior to the start of construction, and conducting “ritual activities
[...] to ensure the longevity of the terrace” (Assefa and Bork 2014, 937). The
social interactions of terrace building are deﬁned in terms of the constructive
and preparatory activities that require “many hands” and “much manual labor.”
These also shape the normative category of “good farmer” as one that constructs
and maintains terraces (Assefa and Bork 2014, 940).
In addition to these culturally and ecologically speciﬁc eﬀorts used to
evaluate and maintain soil, another set of activities used to assess soil and
inform farmers’ soil management practices is soil testing. Soil testing is a
practice that has a long history. The twelfth century agricultural compendium,
Kitāb al-ﬁlā- h.ah, (“Book of Agriculture”), collected by Abū Zakariyā Ya h.yā
ibn Mu h.ammad ibn A h.mad ibn al-‘Awwām’s, discusses soil assessment and
improvement techniques, the production of composts and manures and their
application, techniques for leveling land for irrigation; Qalīb or soil tillage,
digging, ploughing and ameliorations of the soil, and explanations of how
legumes beneﬁt soil ( Ibn al-‘Awwām. ,2000;Lord,1979).Kitāb al-ﬁlā- h.ah
5“Kinding activities” here is intended to collectively capture the historically and culturally
embedded interactive processes and practices that individuals and communities use together
in making, discovering, delimiting, reconstructing, and sharing kinds as well as how these
vary within different scientific disciplines (Kendig 2015 , 1-6) and within distinct local and
indigenous communities (Kendig 2020 , 2).
99 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
included the agronomical traditions from 112 early agronomists and other
sources collected together in the treatise. While the Kitāb al-ﬁlā- h.ahis a written
collection of traditional agricultural knowledge, agronomic practices are also
passed down through generations of farmers through teaching and doing.
The teaching of new “farm hands” to evaluate soils by, for instance,
handling soil to feel for a clayey residue or a dry sandy texture; picking up
a handful of soil to squeeze it to decide whether the soil is dry enough to
dig in and plant; or sifting in the soil to evaluate its organic components are
some practices shared between farmers ( Curell,2016). One practice commonly
used by many farmers worldwide to assess the soils’ organic components—
or at least some of the more prominent ones—is to collect, sort, and count
worms in a particular region of farmland ( Curell,2016). Counting worms
is used to inform a farmer of the soils’ living communities, and the number
of worms is taken to be an indicator of previous worms’ contribution to soil
organic materials such as worm casts, whether the soil has suitable minerals and
moisture levels for worms to thrive in, and whether there is compaction that
reduces the number of worms ( Curell,2016). All of these factors can potentially
inform farmers’ decision-making around future soil and crop management.
While the practice of worm counting is ubiquitous, the meaning of the ﬁndings
is judged on the basis of local knowledge, type of worms, local expectations
of soil moisture, and crops planted, all of which refer back to the history of
haptically shaped agricultural ecologies by virtue of generations of farmers’
planting, tilling, and the sharing of soil management strategies from elders to
young farmers in the area.
Understanding local processes of compost-making, which sorts of plants
are available and used, as well as the types of worms that cocreate the compost
matters. Recent research reveals that “the quality and characteristics of most
chemical properties such as CEC, NT, Av. P , K, Zn and the like depends on
the types of earth worm species (locally collected or the world wide adapted
Eisenia fetid ) and types of compost (vermicompost or conventional compost)”
(Eshetu et al. 2022, 15). Not only does the local species of worm matter, the
kind of compost that is used and how it is made are also signiﬁcant diﬀerence
makers with regard to what is known by counting worms in relation to soil
assessments. For instance, the means by which soil is enriched covaries with
farming practices and cultures as these inform how compost is to be made.
Compost might be made by combining ﬁeld pea, fava bean, wheat and barley
straw following a recent agricultural extension study at Sinana Agricultural
Research Center in the Southeast Highlands of Ethiopia (Eshetu et al. 2022,
15), or by mixing three parts sawdust or wood shavings to one part manure
CATHERINE KENDIG 100
and fresh grass clippings as the combination the Michigan State University
Agricultural Extension in the U.S. recommends ( Gould et al. ,2022).
Haptic soil assessment techniques are often used on their own. But they
can also be used by farmers in identifying the samples farmers choose to send oﬀ
for “precision soil sampling” (Starr and Eck 2021, 26). Precision soil sampling
requires farmers to collect samples to send for chemical analysis. Fields are not
homogenous with respect to soil type, amount of organic matter, water, or
nutrients. This heterogeneity may be the result of several factors including soil
type, historic use of the areas for crops (e.g., a cotton-maize-soybeans crop
rotation may have been used, or peanuts may have been planted), past yields,
whether there were livestock present (e.g., cattle, chickens, swine), or whether
drainage or irrigation systems were maintained. How to sample depends
on farmers’ prior knowledge of the farm and farming practices which also
informs the choice of which method a farmer may prefer (Starr and Eck 2021,
26). For instance, precision soil sampling using the “zone” method requires
farmers’ knowledge, which includes knowledge of past yields for the areas to
be sampled, topographical information, agricultural technologies employed,
and local ecology (Starr and Eck 2021, 27). In this way, farmers’ knowledge
informs how sampling units are identiﬁed as exemplar samples from diﬀerent
distinct ecological areas (e.g., soil near a higher elevation or ridge, lower ﬁeld,
in a ﬁeld where soybeans were grown continuously in the years prior, or soil
near an irrigation pivot) (Starr and Eck 2021, 27). As such, which soils farmers
choose to identify as samples depends on farmers’ haptic interactions through
farming practices with the diﬀerent types of soils in diﬀerent regions of their
ﬁelds in diﬀerent growing years. These haptic interactions inform their choice
of what they consider exemplar samples given their knowledge of the soil
through working with it, thereby providing the grounds for identiﬁcation of
the sampling units.
Focusing on the haptic interactions of farmers with soil provides useful
ways of understanding farmers’ conceptions of soil health, through their
conservation strategies and soil management practices. As the diverse methods
of soil conservation and management in the above examples show, cultures and
practices make ﬁelds and soil what they are as well as how they are evaluated.
Through cultures and practices of soil testing and managing, soil health as
an agricultural concept is also made and remade through histories of farmer-
soil interactions. This is not just abstract conceptual remaking but reﬂects the
actual remaking of soils through farmers’ soil management decisions. Farmers’
interactions can intentionally or unintentionally make or remake the soil
into the kind of soil the farmer seeks to interact with or conserve for future
101 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
generations.
Taking an interactive approach to perspectivism and a focus on haptic
interactions reveals an equally interactive causal understanding of agricultural
research on soil management strategies. The soil-human relationship is one that
is causally reciprocal in the making and remaking of soil and humans through
soil management decisions and practices. That is, human-managed soils and
soil-managed humans are reciprocally cause and eﬀect of their own existence,
both the result of the history of human-soil agricultural-ecological interactions.
The practice-focused interactive approach to perspectivism outlined here
reconceives soil health as a reciprocal notion of soil-human interactions that
are embedded within cultural and ecological histories of farm management
activities. As a reciprocal notion, it connects soil with those whose care and
management contribute to the making of the kind of soil that is the result of
these intentional and unintentional interactions. But it also captures the ways
in which the soil that results from the history of these interactions in turn
shapes the kinds of soil management activities in the future, thereby capturing
a reciprocal and multidirectional cultural-ecological causal system.
4. THE VALUE-LADENNESS OF ONTOLOGIES
In this ﬁnal section, I show how my proposed interactive account of
perspectivism is required if what we want to do is to understand how ontologies
are chosen, why they are chosen, and how they are used to pursue diﬀerent goals
in diﬀerent value-laden situations.
How does my practice-focused interactive account of perspectivism
help reveal the haptic relationships on which soil concepts and categories are
grounded in agriculture? Categories and concepts mark what is of interest
or for a particular purpose. They carve the world up into its perceived
natural and social kinds. The categories and concepts chosen for a particular
agricultural purpose make ontological, epistemological, sociological, and
practical diﬀerences as they impact what is conceived of as good soil as well
as who are good farmers, and what are good soil management practices. How
farmers, farms, and their farm management strategies are categorized aﬀects
how soil is understood and assessed. An interactive account of perspectivism
directs attention to how categories and concepts are made and how they
provide the means by which soil goodness can be understood through farmers’
culturally and ecologically situated soil management strategies. In doing so it
explains the relationship between categories, concepts, choices, and the value-
ladenness of these.
CATHERINE KENDIG 102
“Value-ladenness” is used to identify the role and expression of value
in several diﬀerent ways. For instance, when referring to the value-ladenness
of categories and concepts, the ladenness may refer to diﬀerent kinds of
values, e.g., either epistemic values or non-epistemic values. But, if what one is
interested in is not just what are the kinds of values that are laden in a particular
category or concept, but instead how the choiceof categorizations or concepts is
itself value-laden, more clariﬁcation is needed. To help clarify, I refer to Ward’s
(2021) recent taxonomy of the value-ladenness of choices. Ward identiﬁes four
ways in which choices can be value-laden: values can serve as reasons that can
motivate someone’s choice; justify it; be causally implicated by the choice made;
or be impacted by a choice that is made (Ward 2021, 54-5). Elaborating on
values laden in theories that are causally implicated by the choice made, Ward
clariﬁes, “when [authors] claim that scientiﬁc choices promote values, they
mean that those choices facilitate the ﬂourishing of certain goods in the world”
(Ward 2021, 57). Discussion of this sort of value-ladenness in the science and
values literature in philosophy is not as common as discussion of the other three
sorts. She suggests that although pervasive, the relationship between values
and choices as causal eﬀectors is often hidden (Ward 2021, 57). Although less
common, examples where it has been explicitly discussed exist both within the
values in science literature as well as outside of it.
A recent critique on natural kinds argues that the epistemic value of
natural kinds cannot be explained independently of the non-epistemic values
that underpin them ( Kendig and Grey ,2019). The critique is aimed at those
seeking to justify epistemology-only accounts of natural kinds arguing that
all that is required for natural kinds is that the clusters of properties relied
upon for kind-membership is that they are “suﬃciently stably co-instantiated
to accommodate the inferential and explanatory uses to which particular
sciences put [natural kinds]” (Slater 2015, 396). Proponents of epistemology-
only accounts contend there is no need to rely on non-epistemic values or
metaphysical commitments as all that is of epistemic value is the stability of
the clusters of properties that license inferences. Kendig and Grey disagree,
arguing that the stability of these clusters can only be explained in terms of non-
epistemic values such as metaphysical commitments that provide an answer
towhythese clusters of properties and not others, are those that can license
inferences:
Attributions of stability are always made on the basis of assumptions
about which counterfactual perturbations are relevant. Those assump-
tions include certain underlying metaphysical commitments. The epis-
103 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
temic value of a natural kind is thus contingent upon those metaphysical
commitments (Kendig and Grey 2019, 369).
Attributions of stability rely on choices based on the assumptions one
holds about which possibilities are relevant to consider and which are not.
Commitments to a particular way the world is or should be, are causally
implicated by the choice made.
The choice of soil management strategies relies on farmers’ perspectives
and values embedded within these choices. What farmers consider soil to be,
what soil should be, and what is their role in making bad soil good are causally
implicated in the choice of soil management strategy they make. These values
of what is good soil, a good steward, a good farmer are causally eﬃcacious
diﬀerence makers when it comes to making choices about soil management
strategies. The reason they become causally eﬃcacious diﬀerence makers is in
virtue of the farmers’ soil relationships and how these are captured by the
haptic and visual metaphors they use in conceiving of them. As such, these
sensory based metaphors are also value-laden insofar as they capture the types
of relationality felt in soil-human interactions that are used in ontologizing
practices. In this way, perspective impacts what farmers take to be important
strategies to adopt, and which are considered to be less important to adopt.
These valuations of strategies are informed by epistemic and non-epistemic
values anchored to particular metaphysical representations of the world. The
choice of soil management strategies depends on farmers’ judgements about
the relevance or irrelevance of their use for their soil goals. Good kinds of soil
management strategies rely not just on those that ﬁt to these soil goals, but also
on their feasibility within the community, on the belief that these strategies
will be those that can be stably maintained, and on the evaluation of these as
the sorts of strategies a good farmer should adopt if soil care is the aim.
Considering the value-ladenness of farmers’ soil management decisions
in light of an integrated account of perspectival realism provides an opportunity
to investigate the causal eﬀects the holding of values has on farmers’ decision-
making activities around soil. The discussion of value-ladenness also shines a
light on the causal impact social scientists’ methodological decisions about how
to categorize their subjects of interest into conspeciﬁc groups are also guided
by values. These decisions rely on valuations such as what are the legitimate
grounds on which to base categorizations and according to which values should
the grounds for conspeciﬁcity be chosen, among others.

5. HUMAN-MANAGED SOILS AND SOIL-MANAGED HUMANS
One task that philosophers can pursue is analyzing whether the ontological
categories used in research on soil management practices are apt for the
purposes for which they are used. This is the project pursued in the ﬁrst
half of the paper. It began, investigating whether the empirical grounds
on which the categories are based reﬂects the actual ecologies, cultures,
and histories of community practices that inform farmers’ soil management
choices. It then analyzed diﬀerent categorizations of perspectives, identities,
and decision-making strategies of farmers around soil management used in
recent social science and agricultural research. Following this, it examined how
soil, soil management strategies, and land capability categorizations have been
recategorized with reference to local ecologies and culturally situated farming
practices.
Illustrating how ontological categorizations of soil management shape
concepts relating to soil, the second half of the paper examined the concept of
soil health. Conceptions of soil health were shown to covary with ontological
categories of soil management in virtue of farmers’ soil assessments which
relied on soil type, previous yield, crop rotations, and the result of recent soil
management strategies, local ecologies, anticipated weather events, and the
history of agricultural activities that in their continued practice aﬀorded the
soils now present.
Expanding on this, I introduced a new interactive account of perspectival
realism for soil management. To do this, I employed Chirimuuta’s haptic
metaphor to rework my own version of perspectival realism into an haptically
interactive, practice-based account. My new interactive account of perspectival
realism oﬀers a haptic alternative to soil management ontologies empirically
grounded in the practices of farmers as reported in farmer-focused and
agricultural extension-based research studies. Farmer-focused research includes
ﬁrst-person accounts of how farmers work local land, interact with local
ecological terrain, and are guided by cultural agricultural practices shared
within communities and in the practices of neighbors. These accounts provide
the means by which to grasp the multiply situated interactions that inform how
farmers choose to manage local land and soil.
Studying these multiply situated interactions also provides empirical
justiﬁcation for a new reciprocal understanding of farmers’ soil management
decisions as those that are both cause and eﬀect of soil. Decisions regarding
how soils should be managed are shaped by the soils, their properties,
and their perceived capabilities. Soils’ properties in turn are the result of
105 JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ONTOLOGY
previous agricultural decision-making in light of culture, ecological terrain,
crops intended to be planted, and values of farming held by decision-makers.
The reciprocal causality of culturally and ecologically situated soil-human
interactions means that in grasping what are human-managed soils, soil-
managed humans are also grasped as the result of the co-managing relationship.
Soil-managed humans are those whose future decisions about soil management
are inextricably linked to the properties of the soil that is now in their
hands. Bringing an interactive approach to perspectival realism to bear on soil
management strategies also directs attention to the culturally and ecologically
situated values of a “good farmer” and “good farming practices” embedded in
the soil management choices farmers make. Exploring the value-ladenness of
these choices, the paper concluded with an investigation of the values that are
causally implicated in farmers’ choices of soil management strategies.
