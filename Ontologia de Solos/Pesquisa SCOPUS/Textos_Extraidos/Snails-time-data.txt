Snails, time, data: On the politics of
mass-digitization and the possibility
of data drift
Roos Hopman
Abstract
In natural history museums around the globe, museum staff are working on making collections of specimens (such asinsects on pins, snail shells, dried plants, mounted birds) digitally available through online databases en masse. The
mass-digitization of specimens is urgent especially now, so museum actors and biodiversity scientists stress, as natural
history collections could provide the biodiversity sciences with crucial data for research into the effects of climate-changeinduced biodiversity loss. This paper investigates the processes and practices through which these biodiversity data are
produced. It argues that the work of data production requires the negotiation of- and grappling with different tempor-
alities, and that attending to these temporalities contributes to a further understanding of the politics of mass-digitization.Building on ethnographic ﬁeldwork in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin ’s collection of snail shells, the paper brings into
view the work required to make snail specimens and their metadata digital. Following steps in a mollusk digitization work-
ﬂow—meant to streamline and scale up digitization processes —it attends to the misalignment of rhythms; the importance
of informal cleaning labor; the negotiation of social, biological, and colonial temporalities in practices of label transcription;
and the anticipatory and expansive logics of mass-digitization. Drawing on snails ’ability to “drift,”it raises data drift as a
way of engaging with natural history collections and their data.

Kingdoms of dark data
In this paper, I think through the production of digital data
while considering an unlikely ﬁgure: the snail. This does
not mean presenting a story about the fast and the slow.Rather, it means learning that iterations of pace, despite
speed being evoked as a central rationale for digitization
in memory institutions and beyond, might not be the mosthelpful analytical perspective when contemplating data pro-
duction (and snails). But for now, let us go back to October
2021, when a machine affectionately called “the Beast ”
(“It’s big, and it ’s loud ”),
1arrived at Berlin ’s natural
history museum, the Museum für Naturkunde (hereafter:
MfN). As part of a “unique pilot project, ”this Beast, the
Entomology Conveyor, was to enable the industrial-scale
digitization of the museum ’s insect collection. The system,
run by human scan operators, was to carry pinned insectsand the labels attached to them over a conveyor belt, photo-
graphing them in high resolution along the way. The photo-
graphs of the insects would then be saved on a servertogether with their metadata and eventually made “digitallyaccessible ”
2to science and society through an online
infrastructure.
In press releases published ahead of its arrival, the
museum ’s leadership stressed that this novel system
would signi ﬁcantly speed up the process of rendering its
collections digital: “Now, cost-effective, fast, and accurate
automated digitization is within reach: By using the new
and unique Entomology Conveyor, the Museum für
Naturkunde Berlin will be able to massively speed up thedigitization process. ”
3The rhetoric of “speeding-up ”pre-
sented here is central to arguments made in favor of digitiz-
ing natural history collections and making biodiversity data

more accessible. Researchers in natural history and (evolu-
tionary) biology have emphasized the need to digitize on anunprecedented scale, to massively “scale up ”and“acceler-
ate”the process of making collections digital (see, e.g.
Hedrick et al., 2020; Heerlien et al., 2015). This urgencyis often linked, I observed, to a need to produce data for bio-
diversity and environmental research. Indeed, this literature
regards specimens in natural history collections as untappedsources of data —they are therefore also referred to as “dark
data”(see, e.g. Marshall et al., 2018). As the Director of the
Smithsonian Museum of Natural History recently remarkedabout natural history collections in the New York Times ,“It
occurred to us that we each hold these amazing assets …
We realized that we were presiding over these kingdomsof dark data. ”
4Once there is open access to historical spe-
cimen data, the argument goes, scientists will be able to
make comparisons of species distribution over time, poten-tially helping to slow down or indeed halt climate-induced
biodiversity losses. At the same time, the emphasis on
mass-digitization draws attention to the role played by tem-porality in the production of digital data more generally.
Not incidentally, when the term “big data ”was ﬁrst
coined in the early 2000s, velocity was, alongside volumeand variety, one of its key attributes (Kitchin and
McArdle, 2016).
In this paper, I consider the project of mass-digitizing
natural history collections through the lens of data produc-
tion. I deliberately use the term “data production ”here: I am
not so much interested in practices surrounding the process-
ingof data, that is, preparing them for analysis (see, e.g.
Leonelli, 2019; Plantin, 2021), but more in the translation
of physical objects into digital forms. In part, this is abyproduct of the institutional setting in which I conducted
my research: for this natural history museum, the effort of
transforming physical specimens into digital formats
seemed to come before concerns about how the resulting
data might subsequently be stored, managed, used, andmaintained. Perhaps comparable to “big biology ”initiatives
(Davies et al., 2013) or border-control practices (Leese and
Pollozek, 2023), biodiversity science is a ﬁeld where the
sheer availability of ever-more data is expected to contrib-
ute to the betterment of research and governance (in this
case, through conservation and ecosystem managementmeasures). However, the socio-material conditions of data
production matter to how data is then processed and made
available, and as such to how biodiversity crises areapproached and managed. As the above already suggests,
these are not purely technical processes (Thylstrup, 2018).
I will show how the work of data production requiresthose digitizing to negotiate and grapple with different tem-
poralities, arguing that attending to these differences can
contribute to a further understanding of the politics of mass-digitization (Thylstrup, 2018). Paying attention to tempor-
ality offers insights into the misalignment of rhythms; the
importance of informal cleaning labor; the negotiation ofsocial, biological, and colonial temporalities in practices
of label transcription; and the anticipatory and expansivelogics of mass-digitization.
My analysis builds on two years of working at the MfN
as a guest researcher between 2021 and 2023, a period inwhich I collaborated on a project studying museums as
spaces of social cohesion. The main focus of my project
was the then recently-launched mass-digitization endeavor,in particular, the discursive and material practices involved
in the project. What were the envisioned uses and promises
of these data, and why did there appear to be such anurgency to produce them en masse? To ﬁnd out, I attended
museum meetings on the various digitization projects and
attended conferences on biodiversity digitization. I wasshown around by curators and conducted interviews with
digitization managers, scan operators, and engineers in
order to understand the rationales, promises, and complica-tions of (generating) natural history collection data. As an
anthropologist of scienti ﬁc practice, I wanted to contextual-
ize my ﬁndings through the workings of digitization “on
the ground. ”I thus conducted three months of focused
ethnographic ﬁeldwork in the malacology (mollusk) collec-
tion. While my attention was initially drawn to theEntomology Conveyor, one digitization manager suggested
I do my research with the mollusks instead. He expressed
his concern that the Entomology Conveyor project would“overshadow ”other digitization projects at the museum
and told me that they were “always in need of help and
hands ”
5in malacology. I worked in the collection two to
three days a week, transcribing specimen labels and scan-
ning shells along with my collection-based colleagues,
who were simultaneously my interlocutors.
Encompassing an estimated 5 to 8 million individual
snails (or rather, their shells), the malacology collection is
the museum ’s largest after the insect collection,6and is
thus considered a pivotal testing ground for digitization pro-
cesses —and not only for this institution. With their partly
automated setup for digitizing snail shells, my colleagues
in malacology were hoping to set a precedent for other insti-
tutions aiming to digitize their collections (including, e.g.ancient papyrus documents). Mollusks, the taxonomic
group to which snails belong, are furthermore deemed
important indicators of the species diversity and health oflocal ecosystems; they are considered “sentinel species ”
(Van Dooren, 2022: 201). Their habitats are often small,
and because of their sensitivity to moisture and temperature,they do not adapt well to changes to their environment.
Their “distribution in time and space ”therefore provides
“a foundation for [the] environmental monitoring of all
human-impacted habitats ”(Sierwald et al., 2018: 177).
To be sure, the extinction of species and the destruction
of ecosystems are posing crises that are real and demandurgent responses. However, the proposed response of
making biodiversity data available begs critical engage-
ment, as presenting data as a solution and digitization as a2 Big Data & Society
linear, easily scalable project sidelines questions about how
the historicity and socio-material conditions (Bates et al.,2016) of digitization shape the resulting data (Kaiser
et al., 2023). In the following, I would like to draw attention
to practices of digitizing snail shells, in particular the humanlabor of cleaning and transcription it requires. I will be
guided by the steps speci ﬁed in the malacology collection ’s
digitization work ﬂow, introduced to make the work
smoother and more ef ﬁcient, showing that digitization is a
process not easily streamlined or scaled up. In the conclu-
sion, inspired by snails ’ability to “drift”(Van Dooren,
2022: 61), I will raise the possibility of what I call “data
drift”as a way of relating to natural history collections
and their data.
Digitization and data practices
In her work on digitization in the cultural heritage sector,
Nanna Bonde Thylstrup (2018) offers an initial understand-
ing of mass-digitization and its politics. While not speci ﬁc-
ally addressing natural history and its collections, her work
proves instructive when considering snails and other
to-be-digitized life-forms. Thylstrup reminds us that mass-digitization is never “a neutral technical process ”(2018:
5), suggesting to approach “mass digitization projects as
…emerging sociopolitical and sociotechnical phenomena
that introduce new forms of cultural memory politics ”
(2018: 4). She argues that these new memory politics are
in part a result of the enrolment of a new host of actors(and with that, new interests) in otherwise public institu-
tions. It is precisely the “conﬂicting motives and dynamics ”
emerging from these (to a large extent commercial) actorsand interests that Thylstrup identi ﬁes as key to analyzing
the politics of mass-digitization. She locates these tensions
above all on the infrastructural level, thus calling for an“infrapolitics ”of mass-digitization.
Thylstrup ’s impressive work recognizes the importance
of“everyday practices ”when considering infrapolitics,
but these practices remain somewhat abstract in her descrip-
tions; the main actors in her analyses and stories are public
institutions such as libraries and museums, commercialcompanies, and platforms such as Google, as well as
smaller-scale digitization initiatives. I add further nuance
and concreteness to Thylstrup ’s work by offering a detailed
ethnographic account of mass-digitization in practice,
paying special attention to the dimensions of time and tem-
porality. My own take on politics, then, is inspired by workin science and technology studies and actor-network theory
(ANT) in particular, which approaches the worlds around us
as complex networks of heterogeneous relations. ANT isnot so much concerned with the explicit motives and
dynamics of human actors but rather focuses on how
things are done : their practices (on digitization, see, e.g.
Roth and Bowen, 1999; Shavit and Griesemer, 2011).
Following this approach, politics emerge not necessarilyin con ﬂicting interests, but in the differential effects pro-
duced through the ways that things, people, processes, tem-poralities, and materials come to relate in practice.
As suggested above, I characterize the practices consid-
ered here as practices of data production . Philosopher
Sabina Leonelli ’s work has provided detailed insights into
a wide variety of data practices, or “activities involved in
handling data ”(Leonelli, 2020: v). In these descriptions,
data production anddata processing are often taken to
refer to the same set of practices. I aim to add to
Leonelli ’s analyses by distinguishing data production as a
separate set of practices. Whereas data processing can be
characterized as the cleaning, organizing, and structuring
of data (see, e.g. Boumans and Leonelli, 2020; Plantin,2021) in order to prepare them for analysis, data production
in this case revolves not so much around the handling of
data, but rather the socio-material conditions in whichdata come into being .W e
ﬁnd examples of this in
Leonelli ’s work on phenomics (2019), where she details,
for example, “plants playing tricks ”(p. 22) by dropping
leaves during digitization processes, the demands of soil
and lighting, and the quirks of digitization systems.
Where other analyses of mass-digitization have paid moreattention to the processing, movement, and use of data —
for example, the value of mass-digitized content for differ-
ent users —or the novel demands placed on (cultural) heri-
tage institutions to acquire computational expertise and
“data skills ”(Ames and Lewis, 2020; Bonacchi, 2021), I
offer a detailed account of data production in particular.
Finally, where we are matters. As outlined in the intro-
duction, data from natural history specimens is being pro-
duced against the backdrop of biodiversity loss.Mass-digitization is seen to serve the development of
“global databases ”of biodiversity data (Nadim, 2021), or
what might be referred to as “biodiversity panopticons ”
(Bowker, 2000: 645). These data are generally taken to
inform biodiversity research, “to enhance our understand-
ing of biodiverse systems ”(Nelson and Ellis, 2018: 1).
As ecologists Anne Magurran and Brian McGill write,
“Climate change and biodiversity loss have increased the
urgency for more and better data ”(2011). By studying
these practices, I therefore additionally contribute to schol-
arship on the politics and “dataﬁcation ”of nature (Nadim,
2021).
Snails have shaped the very digitization processes and
technologies that we encounter in the museum collection:both the development and eventual form taken by the scan-
ning machine —which was adapted speci ﬁcally to accom-
modate the diversity of snail shells —and the way the
work is organized, as those digitizing were deliberately
physically removed from the collections to prevent them
from becoming too enthralled in the shells (i.e. to avoidthe risk of the snails eating away at their work time and ef ﬁ-
ciency). Indeed, as noted by Marisa Anne Bass and collea-
gues in their aptly titled edited volume Conchophilia ,Hopman 3
“Shells have long fascinated through their variety, their
beauty, their shapes, colors, and luminescence ”(2021: 3).
In this sense, these snails (and nature more generally) are
not simply passive objects in digitization processes.
Rather, as suggested by Sarah Besky and Alex Blanchette(2019: 2 –3), they invite us to consider that “the nonhuman
world ”has the “capacity to work upon us, against us, and
perhaps with us. ”
How can snails, then, help us to think about data produc-
tion and temporality? Snails are often reduced to caricatures
of slowness, which, observing how they move, is notwholly surprising. Yet, snails have an astonishing ability
to travel great distances, to which their presence on
islands around the world attests. Snails can close off theirapertures with a mucus membrane, allowing them to ﬂoat
in salty water for weeks on end, and scientists have theo-
rized that they have reached remote islands by crawlingonto the backs of birds. Field philosopher Thom van
Dooren therefore sees them as capable of “a particular
form of deep time travel: drifting .”As he goes on to sum-
marize, “snails amaze with their capacity to move so far,
to spread so widely, while doing so little …the highly suc-
cessful passivity of snails might be seen as a remarkableevolutionary achievement ”(2022: 61). It is snails ’capabil-
ity to forego control and direction, to drift, that I would like
to take seriously in this paper.
From a management perspective, drifting and drifters
tend to be undesirable. Drifting implies “a loss of direc-
tion,”“a passive and listless movement, an aimless wander-
ing and driving astray; a loosing [sic] of path and
meaningful course. The drifter, tramp, ranger, vagabond,
is seen as unpredictable and vague ”(Pétursdóttir, 2020:
98). Rather than constituting failure or deviance, something
that should be avoided or sanctioned, I argue that drifting
might instead offer a means of engaging with different tem-
poralities and, thus, the politics of mass-digitization.
Digital snails: Data production in a natural
history museum
As a centralized place for the collecting and ordering of
nature and natural things, the natural history museum has
long been a site for “rendering worlds and their inhabitants
into (digital) data ”(Nadim, 2021: 67). Since the mid-
twentieth century and with the advent of new database tech-
nologies and data storage devices (Bowker, 2005: 132),natural history museums ’“memory practices ”have
become increasingly focused on digital formats. In 1971,
for example, zoologist Peter J.P. Whitehead, who himselfspecialized in the study of ﬁsh, argued for the necessity
of a“quick retrieval system ”for“reviewing the holdings
of any species in any museum ”(1971: 219): “Only a com-
puter can keep systematic information up-to-date and easily
retrievable ”(211). Indeed, the digitization of collectionshas been a recurrent concern in museums since the 1970s
(Parry, 2007). It is in light of these developments, and thegrowing urgency of biodiversity loss, that we should con-
sider current efforts to digitize specimens.
Conducting ﬁeldwork in the collections of the MfN, I
found that the project of mass-digitization is to a large
extent a logistical one (see also Nadim et al., 2024) revolv-
ing around establishing what is in the collections by giving
specimens digital identi ﬁers such as inventory numbers and
QR codes. During an interview, the head of digitization
explained that digitization entails moving information thatis currently only available physically , in the shape of phys-
ical specimens and the text written on their paper labels,
into a digital format. He explained that it is intended tomake collections navigable and specimens “searchable
andﬁndable. ”The promise is that, with the QR code, it
will become possible to additionally connect all the datarelated to a specimen. QR codes were therefore also
described to me as an “anchor ”for the data: by holding
metadata, images, and other information in place, wemight say the QR code prevents data from drifting. Of
course, both digitization technologies and the collections
themselves are constantly developing, changing, andmoving: specimens continuously arrive at the museum,
buildings undergo renovation, curators retire, technologies
break down or are replaced, standards are updated, datagets lost. Thus, as the museum ’s information manager
remarked when I interviewed her early on in my project,
“digitization is a never-ending process. ”
Each collection at the MfN had its own technologies,
databases, and guidelines for digitizing specimens: the dif-
fering materialities and curatorial logics of each collection(and sometimes of individual specimens) demanded an
adaptive, idiosyncratic approach. In the malacology collec-
tion, a “dry”collection of snail shells, digitization work was
divided into two parts: inventorization on the one hand and
the scanning of specimens and their labels on the other.Inventorization was “theﬁrst, and most important step in
the digitization process, ”as a scan operator in the collection
emphasized. Inventorization encompassed checking speci-mens’inventory numbers and transcribing the metadata
(inventory number, taxonomic information, collection loca-
tion) on accompanying labels into a customized data tool
(Figure 1). It also included adding a QR code in paper
form: a tiny piece of paper, cut out by hand by the person
doing the inventorizing. It was not the individual snailsbut“lots,”small boxes containing a number of shells, that
received a digital identi ﬁer in the shape of a QR code. In
the digitization process, each lot of shells (some containingover 50 shells, some only two or three) was considered a
unit, making these little boxes key devices in this context
(Nadim, 2020).
After inventorization, the shells and their labels were
photographed using a (partly) automated scanner. Because
the objective was to digitize the whole collection by4 Big Data & Society
2028, it was not feasible to photograph every individual
shell. “That would take forever, ”the collection ’s digitiza-
tion manager told me. Rather, if a lot contained one or
two shells, they were photographed together in one shot,
and if a lot contained more than three shells, the inventori-zer selected three shells representative of that lot. The
scanner used for this process was developed speci ﬁcally
for the digitization of snail shells and named “DORA ”
after the late, Berlin-based malacologist Dora Godan
(1909 –2006). The camera settings were speci ﬁcally tin-
kered with to account for the wide variety of snail shells:their differing levels of shininess, their various colorings
and shapes. A “scan operator ”would place the shells onto
a tray scattered with ﬁne, dark sand and push it into the
scanner. Four cameras then automatically took pictures of
the tray from above, capturing the shells through apertural
(the opening of the shell), dorsal (the back of the shell),and lateral (the side of the shell) shots (Callomon, 2019).
Through this photographic process, the shells were standar-
dized and reproduced as natural history specimens andobjects for scienti ﬁc inquiry (Daston and Galison, 2007:
134–135; Vennen, 2022), although considering the differ-
ing quality of these images, the question remains as tohow they might actually be used to inform scienti ﬁc
research.
With the initial goal of digitizing this collection of seven
million shells by 2028 in mind, one of the collection ’s scan
operators had been tasked with developing a work ﬂow tostreamline the inventorization process. In the following
section, I will make use of that work ﬂow to turn my atten-
tion to digitization work. As the term suggests, a “work-
ﬂow”is supposed to make the performance of work as
smooth and ef ﬁcient as possible. Dividing the digitization
process into concrete steps to be completed by the inventor-izer, it offers a linear sequence of tasks. However, with my
ﬁeldnotes, I will show that the digitization of specimens is a
process not easily streamlined or ironed out in a linearfashion: it does not entail a simple translation from a phys-
ical to a digital format. I will draw particular attention to the
act of cleaning and the transcription of specimen labels, aswell as the anticipatory and expansive logics of digitization.
As digitization processes were constantly changing, it is
important to note that what I describe here exempli ﬁes the
processes as they played out in March, April, and May of
2022 (Figure 2).
Cleaning lots: Making sedimentary legacies legible
Taking one lot out of one of the hundreds of drawers is nottheﬁrst but the third step described in the mollusk digitiza-
tion work ﬂow. By this stage, the inventorizer had already
walked over to the wooden cabinets and pulled out a
drawer ﬁlled with shells (step one) and then created a
unique folder on their computer designating the cabinetand drawer (step two). These folders were where the ﬁles
for each lot of shells were to be stored. The digitizer then
had to reach into the drawer and select one of the lots con-taining shells, lined up inside the drawer like little bricks.
Some of the drawers were ﬁlled to the brim with lots,
whereas the inventorizer might only ﬁnd a few in others.
In some of the fuller drawers, the lots were scattered
about haphazardly with no apparent order to them. To
make sure none of the lots were forgotten, one of thescan operators explained, “you need to ﬁnd an organized
way to work through the drawer. It ’s like Tetris, you put
everything where it ﬁts.”In addition, the original lot,
made of cardboard, might have lost some of its shape
and ﬁrmness in the period between collection and

digitization. To ensure the shells remained well-
contained, digitizers in some instances would thereforeput the shells into a new (plastic) box altogether. This
process was also referred to as “rehousing ”and shows
how material transformations are crucial to processes of
data production (Bates et al., 2016; Gitelman, 2013: 6;
Wilson, 2011).
Since this collection of snails was not one where the spe-
cimens were looked at particularly frequently, most of the
lots had accumulated a layer of dust and grime. In fact,
my colleagues speculated that nobody had probablylooked at these shells since they were ﬁrst collected. This
meant that most lots had been gathering dust for upwards
of 100 years. Since the inventorizer was the ﬁrst person
to open the lots up and take a look at the shells inside,
my colleagues and I would use a ball of cotton to wipe
away any debris that had accumulated on the lot ’s glass
lid. Making the lot look “clean”was partly about aesthetics,
a pleasing task that added to the inventorizers ’“job satisfac-
tion”(Mol, 2020: 395). Moreover, it enabled the inventor-
izer to see inside the lot and determine whether they had
already given it a QR code and, hence, to avoid digitizing
the same lot twice. Dirt was not only a problem in the mala-cology collection. During a digitization tour through the
mammal collection, the curator pointed out the importance
of cleaning prior to digitization, saying, “We need to get rid
of 150 years of dust to read what ’s on the skulls and the
labels. ”
Besides dust, “dirt”took many other forms in this collec-
tion. I would, for example, encounter little pieces of cork, a
material that had been used to stopper the glass tubes in
which some of the smaller shells had been collected.Another frequent ﬁnd were the exoskeletons of insects
that had fed on any tissues left behind in the shell and
that had since passed away. The amount of dead material
found in the lots depended on the drawer: some shells
seemed to be cleaner than others, meaning they had con-tained less residual tissue and had therefore attracted
fewer insects. A colleague described the lots ﬁlled with
these skeletons to me as “little graveyards. ”To a signi ﬁcant
extent, cleaning was therefore about removing sediments
and remnants that had gathered on- and inside these lots,
and is thus a practice that bears witness to the passing oftime. For the collection to be made digital, those sediments
needed to be removed: both to render the texts on labels,
containing taxonomic and collection information, readable,and to make the snails visible. To borrow from Shana Lee
Hirsch, David Ribes, and Sarah Inman, cleaning here can
consequently be seen as a manner of reckoning with the col-lection ’s“sedimentary legacies ”(2022). Drawing on Star
and Ruhleder (1996), Hirsch, Ribes, and Inman write that
“historical accumulation ”is characteristic of long-term
infrastructures, which, they argue, “‘sediment ’over time ”:
“an infrastructure is built ‘
on top of ’its own past ”(2022:
564). Through the handling and cleaning of each lot ofsnails, parts of the legacies of these collections were
made visible and prepared for reproduction.
Removing sedimented materials from the lots or, in
some cases, putting the shells in a new plastic container,
was a time-intensive process, in particular because theshells were fragile and sometimes very small —some
shells were not much bigger than a grain of sand.
Workers did their best to avoid damaging the fragileshells in any way while working with them, for example,
by handling them with tweezers. Sometimes they used
softer, more ﬂexible tweezers, which were especially suit-
able for picking up and transferring fragile shells, and
sometimes harder ones, mainly used to take the ﬁrmer
paper labels out of the lots. Despite all the care taken notto damage them, it was unavoidable that shells would some-
times “jump”out of the lot and fall onto the ﬂoor, forcing
me to dive under my desk. The fear of damaging specimensaffected how work was performed in the collections, but on
a higher level it was also used as an important argument in
favor of mass-digitization. Digitization holds the promisethat fragile physical specimens will require less handling
in the future, allowing them to be safely stored away. In
this imaginary, like in Tetris, once a row of specimenshas been digitized, they can “disappear. ”
Digitization, I therefore learned, involves a lot of clean-
ing—both in the sense of removing dirt and, with the
“rehousing ”of shells and the Tetris-like work of (re)organ-
izing drawers, a more spatial practice of putting everything
in its proper place (Mol, 2020). This extended to the scan-ning process: when taking pictures with DORA, I soon
found that many of the plastic tubes containing shells
were covered in a chalky white substance. This made itimpossible to see (and hence photograph) the snails.
Cleaning these tubes before photographing them thus
became essential to capturing the shells digitally. While
using DORA one time, I complained to a colleague about
this. She acknowledged that dirt on the tubes was indeeda problem: “We have asked for new, clean materials
many times, but haven ’t received any …Sometimes I just
try to clean the tubes a bit myself. Actually, we are doinga bit of that work, cleaning and replacing the tubes. But it
really should not be our job. That is collection caretaking. ”
Part of the reason for this, my colleagues explained, wasthat requesting new materials was a slow and cumbersome
process that could take months, with documents to be ﬁlled
out, signatures to be gathered, and orders to be placed. “Just
doing it yourself, ”then, became a more viable option for
dealing with such issues. This demonstrates the different
rhythms of digitization, in particular how the rhythms ofscanning work were misaligned with the “organizational
rhythm ”or“institutional time ”(Jackson et al., 2011) of
the museum.
The cleaning work, while forming a substantial part of
the inventorizers ’and scan operators ’tasks, was not
recorded in the malacology work ﬂow and therefore6 Big Data & Society
remains “unspeci ﬁed and unrepresented ”(Star and Strauss,
1999) in descriptions of digitization processes. Engagingwith cleaning work, however, lays bare the different
rhythms at work in digitization projects —rhythms that are
not necessarily in sync. This dissonance signals a discon-nect between upper management and digitization workers
in the collections, causing frictions and delays in everyday
work processes. This section has also shown that cleaning isa way of dealing with sedimented time, a practice where
layers of dust attest to a history of disuse. The removal of
this dust and other debris from the lots, the snails, andtheir labels revealed text and information written by collec-
tors on a particular specimen or batch of specimens.
Cleaning is thus literally a way of making the specimens ’
histories, inscribed on the labels, legible, and since it
makes the shells visible to a scanner, it is imperative to cap-
turing them digitally in the ﬁrst place. Considering the pres-
ence of this dust and the apparent disuse of the shells, this
again begs the question of how these snails, once digitized,
might contribute to biodiversity science. Finally, cleaningspecimens, or the “making of physical improvements, ”

contributes to the continued preservation of specimens
and, as such, to the role of the natural history museum asan institution of conservation (Figure 3).
Label travels: The imaginative work of transcription
Let us go a step further in the work ﬂow. The inventorizer
has added a QR code to the lot and has identi ﬁed whether
this lot already has an inventory number. It is now time to
move on to the label , a piece of paper that is “like a
strange, very brief, postcard ”(Van Dooren, 2022: 129)
from a collection site. The digitizer has to read and tran-
scribe the information deemed most relevant (in this case:
the genus, species, and collection location) from the labelinto the “metadata input tool ”(Figure 1), a customized
interface for recording label data.
While inventorizing, I quickly found that recording the
location where specimens had been collected was the
most time-consuming task. The location had often been
scribbled down in handwriting incomprehensible to me (anon-expert future reader). In addition, since many of the
shells had been collected in the early twentieth century,locations were often written in Sütterlin, a script commis-
sioned by Prussia in 1915. Sütterlin became the empire ’s
ofﬁcial script, the “deutsche Volksschrift ”[script of the
German people] (Schopp, 2016: 286), and was taught in
schools Germany-wide until 1941, when it was banned bythe Nazi regime. Some Sütterlin letters look entirely differ-
ent to those used in contemporary German, and identifying
them takes time and skill. When one of the scan operatorsfound me groaning over an unreadable label one day, she
advised me to keep a tab with the Wikipedia page for
Sütterlin open while inventorizing, which allowed me tocompare the scripts directly. As she recounted, “Atﬁrst, I
constantly had to compare the writing on the labels to this
image. But after a while you learn to recognize theletters. ”As such, I often found myself lifting a label to
my computer screen between tweezers, squinting at the
letters as I tried to ﬁgure out what location the collector
might have meant. Take this excerpt from my ﬁeldnotes:
Deciphering the handwriting on labels is often challenging.
It forces me to be creative: I open google and type in poten-
tial town names until I get a match that seems probable. And
even when the handwriting is clear, the location may referto a place that is now spelled in a different way. A label
that had “Bredenberg ”written on it is an example of this.
There is no such town to be found on google maps, onlya street. There is however a municipality called
“Breddenberg ”and another one called “Bredenbek. ”It
might be either of these two places. The scan operator suggestsI stick with the label, and add a question mark to it. (see
Figure 1)
Due to the age of the labels, some of the locations noted on
them simply no longer existed. Some had changed names,
had been absorbed into neighboring towns and cities, orseemed to have disappeared into thin air altogether. Every
label therefore presented a puzzle, requiring the inventori-
zer to both decipher the handwriting and search the internetand collection catalogues for clues as to the location the
label’s author might have been referring to. The transcrip-
tion of labels thus requires historical curiosity and a willing-ness to investigate on behalf of the digitizer. At the same
time, the location search evinces the different temporalities
at play in collections: the biological temporalities of tax-onomy and species-naming practices, the political tempor-
alities demonstrated by shifting geographies and scripts,
and the technological temporalities of collection cataloguesand computers.
While the labels often contained information about a
geographical location, they would sometimes also describelandmarks (a mill or bridge), the landscape (rivers,
meadows), geological details (limestone, sandstone), met-
rical directions (e.g. 500 m from somewhere or at an eleva-tion of 1000 m), or directions (such as east/west/south of
something). These descriptions could get very detailed.
Figure 3. Ta ke n f ro m “Digitation of the Mollusc collection. Input
Metadata tool. ”March 2022.Hopman 7
One (see Figure 4), for example, reported that it had been
collected “on pastures on the banks of the Magdel [river]
between the oil mill and the bridge on the road to
Weimar. ”What actually remained of this information
after digitization was limited: it pertained to geographicallocations in terms of urban settlements that had been
recorded, not distances or landscape details. Inventorizers
would summarize this information in the location ﬁeld of
the data tool as, for instance, “Magdel bei Weimar. ”In
light of the mass-digitization goal, or processing the set
number of specimens within the timeframe of the mass-digitization funding, such details became redundant. “The
inventorization we perform here in malacology is minimal
data. Minimal data is faster, ”the scan operator explained,
“and it offers a quick overview for online users. They can
quickly see what is there and decide if they want to know
any more details. ”This example demonstrates the tension
between the push for quick access on the one hand and
doing justice to the complexities of collection histories
and contexts on the other.
Locations thus presented many challenges while at the
same time proving highly valuable in research (both for
mapping species distribution and for provenance purposes;see, e.g. Madruga, 2022; Shavit and Griesemer 2011). To
manage the uncertainties the locations presented, I would
often ask one of the colleagues working alongside me tocrosscheck a label for me. I would pass the label, held
between tweezers, over our computer screens to allow theother person to study it. In particularly challenging cases,
the scan operator and digitization manager would gatheraround my computer and puzzle over a location or genus,
mumbling potential town names out loud while passing
the label around.
When none of us could ﬁgure a name out, we would pass
more problematic labels on to the curator, who would take
out her magnifying glass in a ﬁnal attempt at documenting
the correct information. However, always having to consult
colleagues was time-consuming. It therefore became
common practice in ambiguous cases to add a small slipof paper with a question mark to the lot (Figure 5). This
allowed the inventorizer to indicate any uncertainties or
missing information regarding a certain lot, hoping thatthe scan operator might be able to ﬁgure it out during the
scanning process. Thus, as part of the digitization process,
we found ourselves adding more layers of paper (newlyprinted inventory numbers, QR codes, question marks) to
the lots, further sedimenting labeling practices.
The fact that researching locations is a time-consuming
and absorbing process also became clear to me when I
visited a malacology collection in the southwest United
States, where I met two volunteers, 74 and 84 years oldrespectively, responsible for taking care of and digitizing
the malacology collection. I asked the older of the two
what had prompted her to volunteer at the collection:“I’m 84, and I got sick of watching television. Here I get
to look at lots of variation. ”She lifted her hands. “I’ll do
Figure 4. Descriptions.
 Figure 5. “Gattung? ”[Genus?].8 Big Data & Society
it till my hands cramp, which is about two hours. Then I ’m
out.”When I asked the volunteers how the process was
going, her younger colleague told me, “We are digitizing,
but we are behind. I doubt we ’ll ever get there …work is
very slow, especially ﬁguring out the locations. Just
today, I spent an hour looking for a location in Hawaii. ”
Jokingly, her colleague added, “We are making snail pro-
gress here. ”In addition, for these digitizers in the US, the
work brought back memories of past travels: “A lot of the
places on the labels I have been to, and they bring back
memories for me. ”Digitization was a project that allowed
them to step out of their daily routines —to drift off to
other places and times.
While digitization is a future-oriented project aimed at
offering solutions to biodiversity loss, the section above
demonstrates that it requires inventorizers to grapple with
the very historicities of natural history collections:through their digitization work, inventorizers come to
reconstruct the times and places of these specimens ’collec-
tion contexts. For the collection of Brandenburg snails, thismeant, for example, tracing the shifting boundaries of the
German Empire, which had extended into parts of contem-
porary Poland and Russia in the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries, and encountering the nationalist polit-
ics of script. Or in the case of our North-American volun-
teers, it meant bringing back memories of past trips. Thisshows that digitization involves the imaginative work of
recollection: both of natural history as a geopolitical
project and of the digitizers ’own lives and connections.
As the historian Catarina Madruga puts it, “The metadata
that accompanies collection objects and clari ﬁes where,
when, and how specimens were collected in the ﬁeld is at
the core of research on colonial, labor, and environmental
history ”(2022: 9). However, scaling up the processing of
specimens risks losing the historical richness conveyed by
these labels. Because the descriptions and stories on the
labels were not deemed immediately relevant to scienti ﬁc
biodiversity-monitoring projects and did not contribute to
the goal of digitizing specimens quickly, they were not tran-
scribed into the data tool.
Platzprobleme: Mass-digitization and expansion
At the time I was conducting my ﬁeldwork, my colleagues
were still experimenting with the development of standards
for transcribing labels and working out the optimal DORA
settings for different kinds of shells. Our work was notexactly streamlined or smooth yet; we had not yet
reached the “mass”scale, which is what in part allowed
us to linger over dif ﬁcult handwriting. What was being
anticipated, however, was the eventual “scaling-up ”of
data production, for which the museum had received
funding in 2018.
8The snailforce was to be expanded with
the addition of seven workers and three additional
DORAs, making it possible to process specimens faster.In the following section, I will draw attention to this
forward-looking aspect of mass-digitization, arguing withAdams et al. (2009) that it works through logics of anticipa-
tion and expansion.
Natural history museums have long been characterized
as“centers of calculation ”and accumulation (Latour,
1987: 225), making space a recurring concern. As the his-
torian Bruno Strasser notes in his work on “collecting
nature, ”the“collecting sciences ”face the challenge of
“bring[ing] spatially dispersed objects to a central location
and mak[ing] them commensurable. ”“ Collecting, ”
Strasser writes, “was (and is), above all, a spatial practice ”
(2012: 313). Indeed, due to the physical limitations on
storage room in the MfN ’s main building, collections inev-
itably presented “Platzprobleme ”[space problems], as a
colleague in the mammal collection puts it —and not just
in terms of collection space. Looking back at the historyand context within which the term biodiversity emerged
in the 1980s, ﬁnding the space to count and document
species has always been a central concern. As EdwardWilson (1985: 701) wrote, “I believe that we should aim
at nothing less than a full count, a complete catalog of
life on Earth. To attempt an absolute measure of diversityis a mission worthy of the best effort of science. ”In the
same publication, he raised “information storage ”as a
quantitative issue, a math problem, writing out a calculationfor the meters of shelf space required to document all living
species on paper (Wilson, 1985: 703).
The digitization of collections was presented by some as
a solution to such spatial issues: it was speculated that digi-
tized collections might make it possible to store physical
specimens in a “cheap facility far away from the city
center. ”
9But mass-digitization is making demands on
space in novel ways (Vollmar et al., 2010), forcing digitiza-
tion managers, for example, to consider picture quality:
high de ﬁnition images require the “stacking ”of 20 to 100
photos per specimen. Besides this taking up “a lot of com-
puter power and a lot of time, ”as one museum photog-
rapher explained, it “takes up too much space digitally. ”
Of course, the server space required to store these datamust in addition be maintained and paid for, and data
storage is not without its own environmental impacts
(Monserrate, 2022).
To help us consider the expansiveness of mass-
digitization further, we can turn to the work of Adams
et al. (2009), who in their piece on anticipatory regimesdiscuss spatiality through the notion of expansion:
Anticipatory regimes, like those of capitalism, tend to work
through logics of expansion, in which new territories for
speculation must be continually found to keep the anticipa-
tory logic moving. Anticipatory regimes expand their scopeof inclusion, elongate their reach in time, in space, and in
phenomenological terms. (Adams et al., 2009: 250 –251)Hopman 9
As Adams and her colleagues put it, anticipatory regimes
“work outwardly ”(2009: 251), extending temporally and
spatially in different ways. The process of mass-digitization
works by a similar expansive logic. Indeed, in anticipation
of scaling up digitization, anxieties about collection spacestarted to grow. These included concerns about where to
place the scanners as well as the desks for the new
workers. But there were also more mundane concerns:where were the new colleagues going to have lunch? In
which fridge would they put their snacks? Which bathroom
would they use?
These new workers would not be employed by the
museum but would be hired by an external contractor.
They were going to work on short-term contracts, inshifts, inventorizing or scanning a set number of lots per
shift. Because they would not be hired by the museum,
the workers were not going to have access to museum-widemeetings, workshops, reading groups, or language courses.
They were not meant to stay at the institution long-term.
This was a shame, my malacology colleagues stressed,because it was valuable to have people on board who had
been through different stages of the project, who had seen
mistakes being made, and who had acquired the expertisetoﬁx problems —who knew what works and what does
not. In this sense, mass-digitization functions on the precar-
ious timescales of capitalist production. Furthermore, thescaling-up and formalization of digitization work reduces
the space available to linger over labels: the focus shifts
from the more investigatory, collective, and playful workof label transcription toward productionism. The digitiza-
tion process becomes “subordinated to the linear achieve-
ment of future output ”(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015: 706).
Performing transcription work remotely on the basis of
digital images, away from the collection, was part of this
imperative. The digitization manager told me that “having
the snails in front of you ”slowed down the process of digit-
ization. Being physically present in the collections, peoplebecame “too invested ”in transcribing the labels correctly;
it became hard to “let it go, ”as she puts it. By being
among the snails, in other words, one ran the risk of driftingtoo far away.
Mass-digitization can be considered expansive in that it
draws in an ever-larger host of human and non-humanactors and materials. It not only demands more workers
and novel arrangements of logistical processes; rather, the
mass-digitization of specimens requires paper QR codes,hard drives to store ﬁles and digital images, costly server
space, plastic containers, and technologies such as hand
scanners, tweezers, and scissors. To make room for thenew plastic containers used to rehouse the shells, which
came in all different shapes and sizes to accommodate the
widely diverse shells, a whole section of the collection cabi-nets, for example, had to be cleared out. Within the digitiza-
tion projects, those managing the work and timelines would
moreover frequently refer to ways in which the data couldbe further expanded upon at some point in the future. For
example, while location and collector information wasonly being recorded as “minimal data ”while I was conduct-
ing my ﬁeldwork, my colleagues told me they would be
adding more detailed data “later on. ”As Akhil Gupta
writes, “infrastructure is almost always built to exceed
present needs: it is built in anticipation of a
not-yet-achieved future ”(2018: 63). Furthermore, collec-
tions are not static: new specimens continue to be collected
and added, and new kinds of information, such as genetic
samples, are being connected to existing kinds. In thissense, the project of digitization (and natural history more
generally) is without end, never really complete; or, in the
words of Adams et al. (2009: 256), “As the mode of antici-
pation does not need actual objects or events, but must only
imagine them as possible, the scope of optimization is
unlimited. ”
Finally, more broadly speaking, space is relevant to the
mass-digitization of collections because it reminds us that
natural history has been part and parcel of a territorializing
project of empire (Madruga, 2019; Nadim, 2021). Natural
history collecting, “like establishing empires, requires a
mastery of space ”(Strasser, 2012: 313). As noted by
Strasser, natural history collecting “produced a movement
of natural things, which were often dispersed across the
world, toward central locations, just as empires producedmovements of goods from colonies to metropoles ”(313;
see also Barringer and Flynn, 1998). Most of the MfN ’s col-
lections, and therefore the specimens that are currentlybeing digitized, were collected outside Germany ’s
borders, especially in its former colonies (Heumann et al.,
2018; Kaiser, 2023). With mass-digitization, the aim is tomake these collections accessible globally. However, the
reality is that the valuable physical (type) specimens
remain in the old imperial centers, and it is there that deci-
sions are made about what data is recorded and howit is dis-
tributed —indeed, where “the movement of natural things ”
is managed. As such, the project of mass-digitization may
be viewed as “the sociomaterial terrain, ”where colonial
systems of power and the unequal distribution of resourcesare being in part reproduced (Appel et al., 2018: 2; see also
Kaiser et al., 2023). This becomes all the more poignant
when we recall the purpose of digital collection data —
namely, to fuel research into climate change and species
loss—and consider the geographical distribution of the
drivers of global warming on the one hand and the areasand peoples most affected by it on the other (Pulido, 2018).
Drifting off
This paper has sought to add to understandings of the pol-
itics of mass-digitization (Thylstrup, 2018) by zooming in
on practices of data production and the way that differenttemporalities surface within them. I started out by delineat-
ing how concerns about pace (speed in particular) appear to10 Big Data & Society
dominate discussions surrounding mass-digitization, with
digitization being presented as a linear, easily scalableproject, and the resulting data framed as a solution to bio-
diversity crises. Such an understanding of mass-digitization
leaves little space for engagement with the social, historical,and material complexities of collections, making it tempting
to argue for more “slowness, ”especially considering the
ﬁgure of the snail. As Puig de la Bellacasa, however,
points out in her work on the pace of soil care, slowness
does not offer a way “out”of the linear, progressivist
notion of time as speed, entangled with innovation andnew technologies: “Advocating slowness as time of a dif-
ferent quality against the speed of innovation and growth
in technoscience does not necessarily question the directionof the dominant timeline, which these approaches do by
operating differently within technoscience ”(Puig de la
Bellacasa, 2015: 709). Slowness, even if it may operate dif-ferently, is still a form of speed: it quali ﬁes the movement of
an object over distance, implying a progressive,
forward-looking trajectory. From snails we might insteadlearn the art of drifting , forgoing direction and control to
allow for improbable journeys.
Snails ’capacity to drift, ﬁeld philosopher Thom van
Dooren argues in his work on Hawaiian terrestrial snails,
can be characterized as a form of deep time travel.
Floating and ﬂying around the world ’s oceans, snails,
without human intervention, have made it to islands all
around the world: “At some point in the distant past, a
tiny snail climbed on board a migratory bird, perhaps agolden plover, as it perched or nested overnight …Days
or weeks later, having rested through the exhausting cross-
ing, the snail then climbed off the bird in its new home. ”
While these journeys, as Van Dooren recognizes, are
highly unlikely, they lead to places that matter. My main
takeaway is that they demonstrate the potential affordances
of a lack of directionality, how it opens up unexpected des-
tinations. In her analysis of drift wood (incidentally, anothervehicle that snails have used to ﬂoat around on) washing up
and accumulating on the shores of Norway and Iceland,
Þóra Pétursdóttir has likewise used the notion of drift, ofveering off course, to rethink the meaning of heritage and
its management. Telling stories of waste, discarding, and
neglect, she points to the potential of drift to help usembrace indeterminacy and change instead of approaching
objects of heritage as “compliant subjects of stewardship,
management, and control ”(2020: 97). Moreover, her delib-
erations on drifting have inspired others to draw attention to
the“drift time ”of heritage, characterized as the mixing of
different timelines (DeSilvey et al., 2020). Drifting, asPétursdóttir and DeSilvey et al. agree, opens up “alternative
ways of knowing and reasoning with heritage matters ”
(DeSilvey et al., 2020: 457).
Just as objects of heritage themselves are not “compliant
subjects of control, ”neither are the data that result from
them. This paper has demonstrated that the practices andprocesses that give shape to biodiversity data require a con-
tinuous engagement and grappling with different temporal-ities. Attending to these different temporalities in practice —
when they surface or become obscured in work ﬂows and
inventory or scanning work, when and how they sedimenton and around specimens, and when they become (mis-)
aligned in work processes
—the politics of mass-digitization
become tangible. It then becomes clear that output andaccess to data are being valued over the fostering of
skilled workers and their expertise, that the study of bio-
diversity through taxonomy is being prioritized over inves-tigations into the museum ’s colonial and extractive histories
despite their deep interconnectedness (Raja, 2022), and that
there is little critical re ﬂection on the impacts and long-term
management of mass-produced data. Whereas these con-
cerns currently play a minor role in discussions around
the use and value of the mass-digitization of naturalhistory collections and biodiversity data, they remind us
that biodiversity loss is not simply a natural phenomenon,
but highly political in itself, resulting from the complexinterweaving of historical and socioeconomic processes,
including the continuing legacies of colonialism. To
adequately address biodiversity crises with data, this com-plexity should be re ﬂected back in digitization processes
and given equal weight alongside more technical considera-
tions. Drifting, then, not only offers alternative ways toengage with objects of heritage but also opens the ﬂoor
for discussions of how these objects and their data might
come to themselves inform management.
