apprehends the role of politics and power in reshaping drought, along with the agency of biophysical
processes –soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate –that co-produce droughts and their
spatiotemporal patterning. The drought-stricken Ladismith in Western Cape, South Africa, is the
instrumental case study and point of departure of our empirical analysis. T o advance a materiality
of drought that seriously accounts for the coevolution of biophysical and political transformations,we alter the spatiotemporal and empirical foci of drought analyses thereby retracing Ladismith ’s
socioecological history since colonial times. In turn, such extended framework exposes the agency
of soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate and their metabolic exchanges with processes of col-onisation, apartheid, capitalist and neoliberal transformations of South African economy. We argue
that the narrow pursuit of pro ﬁts and capital accumulation of the few has produced a fundamental
disruption between nature and society which contributed to transform Ladismith ’s drought into a
socioecological crisis. Whilst advancing debates on materiality, we note two fundamental contribu-
tions to the study of drought. First, our approach makes hydrological accounts of droughts less pol-
itically naive and socially blind. Second, it develops a political ecology of droughts and socioecologicalcrises more attuned to the materiality of drought. We contend that apprehending the materiality of
drought and the active role of its non-human processes can further understandings of the workings
of power and the production of socioecological injustices.

Introduction: The socioecological complexity of drought
A multitude of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives has long explored the social and physical
complexity of droughts. Physical and engineering scientists engaged with hydroclimatic issues
(hereafter ‘hydroclimatologists ’) consider droughts amongst the most devastating hazards, that
have caused water shortages and severe famines in many regions across the world (Meza et al.,
2020; Schiermeier, 2019; Van Lanen et al., 2013). For hydroclimatologists, drought hazard is a
complex physical process, characterised by a certain intensity and duration, produced by the pro-gression of below average precipitation, which leads to drier than normal soil conditions and, ultim-
ately, reduced stream ﬂow of rivers, meagre in ﬂow of water into lakes or reservoirs along with
limited groundwater recharge (Mishra and Singh, 2010). According to this framing, when encoun-tering vulnerable systems, drought hazard can more easily escalate from conditions of below
normal precipitation into a social and ecological disruption (Van Loon et al., 2016a, 2016b).
More recently, due to increasing anthropogenic pressures, some hydroclimatologists have startedto explicitly account for the role of human activities in the propagation of droughts
(AghaKouchak et al., 2015, 2021; Van Loon et al., 2016a, 2016b). Although this recognition
allowed novel ideas and methodological approaches to ﬂourish, the politics and power dynamics
underlying drought and its impacts remained unexplored across such studies (Savelli et al.,
2022). Conceptually, the main contribution of the ﬁeld is the understanding that, rather than
static conditions, drought hazards are complex processes co-produced by the interwoven impactsof soil moisture variability, change in water ﬂows, human activities, climate change and micro-
climatic alterations (AghaKouchak et al., 2021).
Political ecologists, in contrast, have mostly emphasised the socially constructed nature of water
scarcity as opposed to the absolute or physical scarcity (Akhter, 2017; Mehta, 2003). These scholars
have critiqued hydroclimatologists for overlooking the social power embedded in socioecological
transformations (Loftus, 2007) and have focused their attention on the relationships between nature,Savelli et al. 101
power and capital (Heynen et al., 2006; Swyngedouw, 1997, 2009). They have also shown that
naturalizing the causes of drought is in itself a political act that shifts human responsibilities
onto non-human processes (Kaika, 2003). Accordingly, a large number of studies have theorised
the socio-economic and political processes that reshape drought and water scarcity, thereby gener-ating uneven outcomes across societies and spaces (Bakker 2000, 2003; Kaika 2003, 2006; Mehta
2003, 2007, 2011; Millington, 2018). Such works employ concepts of production or social con-
struction of water scarcity to expose the politics at play in the uneven experiences or manifestationsof drought events.
Scholarship on the production of water scarcity has mostly focused on questions of water use,
management and distribution, without engaging with the complexity of the drought hazard itself.By conceptualizing drought or water scarcity as socially produced, these studies seem to imply
that independently from hydroclimatological conditions, if the social processes were different,
droughts would not occur (Kallis, 2008). Yet, as Kallis (2008: 104) puts it, ‘one cannot just
presume that a drought will not happen if politics are different without engaging with hydrometeor-
ological and infrastructural speci ﬁcities of the case ’.In other words, work that theorises the social
construction of drought and water scarcity has not yet unearthed the complex biophysical processesthat co-produce, what hydroclimatologists de ﬁne as, drought hazard, i.e. the process that gradually
transforms reduced precipitation into parched soils, drying rivers and ultimately into socioeco-
logical disruption. Dismissing the ‘ecology ’(Walker, 2005), these studies reduce non-humans to
objects that humans mobilise rather than active agents that interact, reshape, and coevolve with
other socioecological processes (Rusca et al., 2017). As for the production of nature thesis, the pro-
duction of water scarcity seems to have ‘squeezed out the productive role of ecological processes ’
and dissolved the ecology ’s heterogeneous realm into the unique category of water scarcity (Bakker
and Bridge, 2006: 9).
Non-human (or post-human) geographies have begun to apprehend the active role of biophysical
forces in co-producing socioecological transformations (Bakker and Bridge, 2006, Castree, 2003).
These scholars have examined what they consider the unpredictable and unruly nature of ecological
processes, and have conceptualised the body as the matter that experiences and enacts socioecologicaltransformations (Bingham, 2006; Longhurst, 2001; Power, 2005, Tsing, 2012; Whatmore, 2002).
Bakker and Bridge (2006) use the term materiality to deﬁne geographies that seek to animate the non-
human, reconnect and redistribute agency across nature and society, and reconceptualise the ‘con-
struction of nature ’. In this light, the material forces are never intrinsically physical or natural, but
rather historically contingent and relational (Bingham, 2006; Panelli, 2010; Power, 2005; Rusca
et al., 2022; Tsing, 2012). Paradoxically, with the exception of a few scholars (Cousins andNewell 2015; Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020; Lave et al., 2014; McClintock, 2015; Rusca
et al., 2022), geographers have rarely engaged with natural scientists who work with material physical
forces. Dismissing the physical and engineering scientists that do not consider politics nor power, geo-graphers have not always been able to apprehend the agency of non-human forces and their implica-
tions on social processes.
By contrast, this paper employs an interdisciplinary approach that moves beyond binary concep-
tualisations of nature and society and accounts for the multiple social and ecological processes that
transform a drought from conditions of below normal precipitation into socioecological disruptions.
We do so by examining the case of Ladismith, a rural community located in South Africa ’s Western
Cape Province, which reached the verge of socioecological collapse after a severe and prolonged
drought in the period 2015 –2019. To consider droughts as reshaped by the interplay of distinctive
socioecological processes, we have extended the temporal and spatial scales of our analysis. Herethe use of critical history is crucial to understand how power, politics and non-human natures
co-evolved and co-shaped each other overtime thereby creating speci ﬁc conditions for drought
hazard to unfold. Thus, this paper expands the analysis beyond the geographical area of102 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
Ladismith and goes back in time to unravel the politics of colonial dispossession, racial and eco-
nomic segregation, capitalism and neoliberalism which have signi ﬁcantly interwoven with pro-
cesses of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover, changes in surface or groundwater ﬂow, and
micro-climatic alterations of Ladismith ’s area. In this way, we reveal the active role that multiple
and interwoven socioecological processes have played in transforming Ladismith ’s drought from a
meteorological event into a dire socioecological crisis. In addition, by retracing the history and
coevolution of Ladismith ’s biophysical and social processes this work exposes the violent and
unjust transformations that have reshaped drought in Ladismith.
Overall, by redistributing the agency between human and non-human natures, the paper contri-
butes to debates on materiality and more speci ﬁcally, advances understanding of droughts and their
socioenvironmental implications. First, our engagement with hydroclimatologists makes critical
geographers ’accounts of the production of water scarcity more attuned to the materiality of
droughts. Such an interdisciplinary collaboration, we argue, is essential as it captures the ways dis-tinctive biophysical processes can enable or constrain human practices and power relations (Lave
et al., 2014). Second, our historical and political ecology analysis also advances hydroclimatologi-
cal accounts of droughts by making them less politically naive and socially blind.
Understanding the complexity of drought: From the production of
water scarcity to material understandings of drought
Drought as production of water scarcity
Political ecologists have long examined the role that human agency or social power plays in pro-
ducing water scarcity and uneven experiences of drought (Bakker, 2000; Kaika, 2003; Mehta,
2003). Their studies have exposed the ways in which the processes of land and water dispossession,capital accumulation, privatisation, commercialisation, and resource management policies, contrib-
uted to reshape manifestations, experiences and representations of drought. Throughout this work,
scholars have mostly conceived droughts as ‘production ’or‘social construction ’of water scarcity
(Ahlers, 2010; Akhter, 2017; Bakker, 2003; 2000; Higgins 2001; Kaika 2006; 2003; Loftus, 2007;
Mehta, 2011, 2003; Millington 2018; Otero et al., 2011; Walker, 2014). Speci ﬁcally, to avoid con-
ceptualisations of droughts and water shortages as merely natural, Bakker (2000) employs NeilSmith ’s notion of ‘production of nature ’. She conceptualises the Yorkshire Drought of 1995 as
the outcome of distinctive water management practices, such as meteorological modelling, water
demand forecasting, and the regulatory practices of the water industry (Bakker, 2000). Morerecently, Millington (2018) has employed the case of the Sao Paulo water crisis (2014) to
explain how scarcity was produced by the combination of existing infrastructural inequalities
and the differentiated abilities of urban residents to store water. Mehta (2003) has long arguedthat social production of drought and water scarcity serves speci ﬁc interests and political ends.
For instance, in Greece, water was discursively constructed as a scarce resource and the drought
became the justi ﬁcation to accelerate the implementation of controversial political economic trans-
formations such as the liberalisation and privatisation of water services (Kaika 2003; 2006). This
literature importantly shows that portraying scarcity as natural and chronic, rather than cyclical
and human induced, has mostly served the interests of the elite. Indeed, depictions of naturalwater scarcity tend to ignore stark inequalities in access to, and control over, land and water
resources (Mehta, 2003). Therefore, when scarcity is considered merely natural or as Akhter
(2017) de ﬁnes it, absolute, the political economic structure that reshapes uneven uses and distribu-
tion of water is concealed. Thus, political ecologists stress the fact that droughts are as much his-
torical, political and context speci ﬁc as they are natural (Akhter, 2017).Savelli et al. 103
Overall, this scholarship devotes most of its attention to the distinctive socio-political processes that
have materially or discursively reshaped the experiences and manifestations of drought. Similar to ‘the
production or social construction of nature ’thesis, to state that water scarcity is socially constructed
inevitably implies that society, social power or social interests do this construction onto somethingelse i.e., nature (Castree, 2003). Thus, even though essential to expose the politics, this explanatory
framework remains limited for two main reasons. First, it reasserts the ontological divide between
nature and society (Bakker and Bridge, 2006; Lima Costa et al., 2017). Second, it reproduces whatHaraway (2015) called the arrogance of the human. By considering nature as socially transformed,
these theories have largely overlooked the agency of the non-human in socioecological transforma-
tions (Castree, 2003). In other words, conceptualizing water scarcity as socially produced concealsthe productive role of the ecological and biophysical processes that co-produce drought or what hydro-
climatologists de ﬁne drought hazard. In turn, such conceptualisations have not seriously accounted for
the agency of soil, vegetation, hydrology and atmospheric processes, nor for their social implications.
In response to critiques of the production and social construction of nature, post-human (also
non-human) geographies have taken on the challenge of decentring the human and reconceptualised
it in its entanglements with other non-human elements (Lima Costa et al., 2017). Drawing uponHaraway ’s Cyborg Manifesto and Latour ’s Actor-Network Theory, many post-human scholars
have developed a relational approach to investigate the agencies of animal, gardens, mushroom
and trees (Bingham, 2006; Panelli, 2010; Power, 2005; Tsing, 2012). Others have focusedinstead on materiality to emphasise the way any matter or material condition can enable and con-
strain social transformations. This literature emphasises that the material is neither pregiven nor
intrinsic, but rather the historical product of both material and discursive practices. Through the rec-ognition of these relations, the ’production of nature ’becomes the ‘co-production of nature ’,a
process in which humans and non-humans coevolve and mutually reshape each other.
Drawing on these interpretations, we argue that decentring human agency and focusing on the
material relationalities of drought constitutes a productive way to overcome the impasse of social
construction and production of nature. However, we also insist that a focus on materiality alone,
might prevent the apprehension of the agency of non-human elements and their social entangle-ments. Thus, in the following section, we engage with hydroclimatological understandings of
drought as a way to capture the co-productive capacity of non-human elements involved in the pro-
duction of droughts and socioecological crises.
Hydroclimatological understandings of drought
Many hydroclimatologists agree that droughts are events generated by the interaction of physicalprocesses that change over time and across space (AghaKouchak et al., 2021). To illustrate, Van
Loon et al. (2016a, 2016b), proposed a conceptualisation of drought propagation that accounts
for complex spatiotemporal processes and dimensions (Figure 1). A drought is usually set off byprolonged atmospheric conditions induced by climate variability (AghaKouchak et al., 2015;
Heim, 2002; Mishra and Singh, 2010). Thus, the ﬁrst manifestation of a drought in a given geo-
graphical area often consists of a meteorological drought , which encompasses a prolonged condi-
tion of e.g., below average precipitation. This can (or may not) evolve into a soil moisture (or
agricultural) drought , during which the soil becomes drier than normal for a prolonged amount
of time and in turn unable to maintain the water required by the surrounding ecosystem.Subsequently, the latter conditions can (or may not) unfold into a hydrological drought , manifest-
ing into reduced ﬂow of rivers, meagre in ﬂow into lakes or reservoirs, and limited groundwater
recharge. Atmospheric conditions –such as a persistent lack of precipitation –inﬂuence both hydro-
logical and agricultural processes. At the same time, hydrological and agricultural processes can also
affect atmospheric conditions via feedbacks between soil moisture, vegetation and evaporation.104 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
This complex web of interactio ns and feedbacks that characterises the propagation of
drought further intertwines with human ac tivities and their impacts. Van Loon et al.
(2016a, 2016b) argue that including anthropog enic pressures is crucial for preventing the
development of ineffective po licies and unintended conse quences. When the cascade of
meteorological, soil moisture and hydrological droughts affect a vulnerable environment,
the drought can produce socioecological impacts and engender a socioecological crisis
(Heim, 2002; Van Loon et al., 2016a, 2016b) –which we de ﬁne as disruption of pre-existing
socioecological dynamics.
One could argue that hydroclimatological understandings of drought hazard propagation are at
odds with political ecologies ’perspective on nature and society. Speci ﬁcally, hydroclimatological
studies often merge distinctive social processes into a limited number of variables and reduce major
social changes to mere population statistics or economic growth. These apolitical interpretations of
society perpetuate the nature-society divide, whilst also obscuring power relations embedded inevery socioecological transformation (Savelli et al., 2022). Such approach plausibly derives from
positivist theories and beliefs according to which the only valid knowledge is the one that can
be observed, measured or experimented. However, whilst interdisciplinary collaborations presentepistemological and ontological challenges (see the Methodology section below), they also offer
new ways of apprehending the agency of non-human processes coproducing drought. Engaging
with hydroclimatologists can open up new questions and possibilities for political ecology analysesto advance the materiality of water, in particular by attending to microclimatic conditions, soil,
vegetation and hydrological changes. Below, we propose an interdisciplinary methodological
approach to unravel the socioecological complexities of droughts and their resulting socioeco-logical crises. Next, we examine the theoretical implications of our framework by examining the
case study of Ladismith.
Methodology: An interdisciplinary approach to unravel the
socioecological complexity of drought
To study droughts and their socioecological implications, we employ an interdisciplinary approach
which integrates political ecology analyses with hydroclimatological studies. Political ecology is
Figure 1. Drought hazard propagation. The diagram shows that human activities in ﬂuence the way in which
droughts propagate from the atmosphere to the ground through land use, irrigation, dams and reservoirs, aswell as water abstraction. At the same time, droughts cause agricultural losses and negative socio-economic
effects, which can re-shape human response to drought. Source: Van Loon et al. (2016a).Savelli et al. 105
essential to critically investigate the processes through which unjust and destructive socioecological
relations are created and reproduced (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020). Yet, a politically con-
scious understanding of socioecological transformations must acknowledge symmetrically the bio-
physical agency of non-human processes, their social constitution, and the dynamic interactionsbetween human and non-human factors (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020; Lave et al., 2014;
Rusca, 2022, Turner, 2016). Thus, whilst pursuing a political ecology analysis, this paper also
engages with hydroclimatology and environmental data. Speci ﬁcally, we use hydroclimatology
to account for the agency of distinctive biophysical processes –soil, vegetation, hydrology and
microclimate –co-shaping the temporal and spatial patterning of drought hazard and, as such,
coproducing its socioecological unfolding. To seriously accounts for the coevolution of biophysicaland political transformations, we expand the temporal and spatial scales of analysis and consider
those social and ecological processes that over time have intersected and produced a speci ﬁc
droughtscape .
A productive interdisciplinary engagement is dif ﬁcult as it implies an engagement with different
ontologies and ways of knowing that are often perceived as not compatible. These differences
require ﬁrst of all, that each scholar possesses a basic understanding (and respect) of all the disci-
plines the research draws on. Next, an interdisciplinary effort needs to be based on common
research questions that can be understood and addressed by each discipline. Last, such an engage-
ment also requires social scientists to overcome stereotypical representations of physical and engin-eering science as ‘irreversibly ’positivistic (Rusca and Di Baldassarre, 2019). In our experience, the
ﬁeld of hydrology and climatology is more complex and characterised by a rich diversity of onto-
logical, epistemological and methodological positions. In fact, within the prevailing positivist trad-ition, some hydrologists have warned against essentialist categorisations and absolutist notions of
space and time. Among those, some recognise the ‘unavoidable subjectivity ’of modelling pro-
cesses, the uncertainty in the research process as well as the importance of context (Beven,2006, 2000; Pappenberger et al., 2007: 275). It is within this community, we contend, that possi-
bilities of collaborations and debate can be initiated.
This interdisciplinary research uses Ladismith as an instrumental case study (Stake, 1995) to
unravel the complexity of the socioecological processes that govern drought hazards.
Throughout this case, the research garners insight about the transformation of a drought hazard
from a severe hydroclimatological event into a far-reaching socioecological crisis. This ruralarea in the Western Cape is not only representative of a place that experienced severe and prolonged
meteorological drought, but also of one that suffered a harsher and more persistent crisis relative to
other areas affected by the same meteorological conditions.
To capture the socioecological transformation of the drought and its implications across the
Ladismith area, our interdisciplinary approach employs a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative
methods. Primary qualitative data were collected through 35 semi-structured interviews and ﬁeld
observations. We investigated diverse experiences of the drought as well as people ’s behaviours,
opinions and emotions, to extensively describe the crisis and expose its inequalities. The inclusion
of different social groups such as white commercial farmers, male and female farmworkers, andother Ladismith inhabitants, have revealed different perceptions and experiences of the same
crisis. Moreover, institutional actors disclosed the evolution of state-society relationships during
the crisis, both from the government as well as the residents ’perspective. Qualitative interviews
have been integrated with other primary data collected from an extended videography project.
Filming in Ladismith established a participatory dynamic with the interviewees, who were able
to share their stories more freely and take a lead in deciding what was relevant to visualise,where to ﬁlm and why. Thus, the video-material provided a more contextual account of the
drought and a more accurate representation of farmers ’along with farmworkers ’relation with
the surrounding dry environment and vice-versa (Fantini, 2017; Rusca, 2018, Thomsen, 2015).106 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
The primary data was complemented by and triangulated with secondary data retrieved from a
documentary analysis of major institutional documents, historical records and media articles rele-
vant to the case study. Altogether this data provided insights into meanings and rationales of
people ’s experiences to facilitate a more accurate historical investigation around the political
forces and powerful interests that have reshaped the materiality and diverse experiences of the
drought.
Quantitative data consists of rainfall data series, assessments of land degradation, the status of
river ecosystems, levels of water consumption and satellite images. This data was retrieved from
local institutions and through extensive documentary analysis. Quantitative data served to
examine and visualise the drought ’s biophysical processes and their socioecological alterations
throughout history. Rainfall timeseries characterise changes in meteorological conditions as well
as the intensity of the latest meteorological event relative to other anomalies that Ladismith has
experienced throughout the last century. Satellite images show the level of hydrological and soilmoisture drought. Last, assessments of land degradation and the status of river ecosystems
retrace changes of physical conditions of Ladismith ’s land and vegetation. Assessments of land
degradation derive from spatial analysis of remote sensing data, ﬁeld observations and data sam-
pling.
1The most used indicators for land and ecosystem status are soil nutrients and biomass var-
iations. These quantitative and visual transformations have been triangulated with literature on the
historical geographies of the region, through which we examine the major socioecological changesthat occurred over the last century.
The sensitivity of the case examined called for more re ﬂexivity on the way we collected the data.
During ﬁeldwork, the most dif ﬁcult aspect was to consider and cope with the power dynamics exist-
ing between the researcher (the lead author) and the diverse group of participants (i.e., Ladismith ’s
local authorities, white farmers, farm-workers and other inhabitants of the area). Neglecting those
dynamics would have been both counterproductive and unethical (Sultana, 2007). Whilst staying inLadismith, the researcher was aware of the power imbalance between her privileged position and
that of the research subjects, and the likely discomfort and ambivalence that this imbalance could
produce in her relationship with participants. One dimension was her white race and privilegedsocio-economic status relative to most of the interviewees. She was also acutely aware of her pos-
ition as an observer of the lived reality of poverty and despair experienced by the population of
Ladismith. To ‘blend in ’as much as possible whilst remaining conscious of the inherent power rela-
tions, the researcher undertook most of the ﬁeldwork following the guidance and advice of local
contacts.
Both local contacts and research subjects extended extraordinary hospitality to the researcher
despite the physical and psychological burden that this work required. Videography also proved
to be an effective tool to reduce power imbalances and ensure a more collaborative research
approach. With very few exceptions, most of the farmers and farmworkers who took part in thedocumentary opened their doors, offered their time, and shared their most distressing stories.
Many farmers and farmworkers were brought to tears in front of the researcher. Most of them
were feeling shame and humiliation over their failure, ﬁnancial struggles and inability to secure
their families ’future. Notwithstanding their embarrassment, research subjects accepted to be inter-
viewed, ﬁlmed and recorded. In some cases, this hospitality and generosity generated a sense of
discomfort in the researcher who could not express her anti-colonial and anti-capitalist positionin front of the people being interviewed, especially in presence of white farmers heavily affected
by the drought. Throughout the ﬁeldwork, re ﬂexivity emerged in different forms of (un)learning
the established research practices that would preserve biased and privileged understanding ofreality. In turn the new practices involved deeper ethical considerations, destabilised the research-
er’s epistemology, and gave space to other voices and perspectives such as the ones of desperate
white farmers trapped in conditions of poverty and struggle.Savelli et al. 107
The socioecological genesis of Ladismith ’s drought
To be able to account for the soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate transformations that
coproduced Ladismith ’s drought, this research alters the conventional spatiotemporal and empirical
foci of drought analyses. Rather than limiting our assessment to the ﬁve years of below average
rainfall and the resulting socioecological crisis, we retrace Ladismith ’s socioecological history
since colonial times. We ﬁrst describe Ladismith ’s socioecological characteristics. Then, we
explain the ways in which processes of colonisation, apartheid, capitalist and neoliberal transforma-
tions of South African economy have closely interwoven with soil, vegetation, hydrology andmicroclimatic processes. In doing so, this extended framework of analysis importantly reveals
that the recent drought also originated in deeply racial and gendered labour relations, processes
of land and water dispossession, along with economic injustice. Over time, such unjust and destruc-tive socioecological transformations have produced what Marx referred to as the metabolic rift
which implies a fundamental separation between nature and humans for the ultimate achievement
of pro ﬁt and capital accumulation (Aslamy, 2021).
Ladismith ’s socioecological features
Ladismith is a rural town situated within the Little or Klein Karoo valley, in the Western Cape prov-
ince (Figure 2(c) shows the geographical boundaries of the study area). The name of the townreveals its colonial legacy, for Ladismith ‘celebrates ’the wife of Sir Harry Smith, a commander
in the British Colonial Army which established the municipality in 1852. Ladismith counts approxi-
mately 7000 inhabitants of which about 80% are coloured, 7% black, and 11% white. Like otherregions in South Africa, the town is characterised by highly unequal development across society ’s
diverse racial groups (Statistics South Africa, 2019). Colonialism, apartheid legacies and neoliberal
policies in the post-apartheid government make South Africa one of the most racially segregatedand unequal countries in terms of land and income distribution (Hall 2004; O ’Laughlin et al.
2013). According to the IMF (2020), the richest 20% earns 68% of the total income, whilst the
poorest 40% earns just 7%. These statistics are marked by deep racial divides, with the blackand coloured communities overwhelmingly located in the poorest 70% and whites in the richest
10%. In addition, poverty is widespread, with almost 50% of the population living below the
poverty line of $2 per person a day (NPC, 2011). Poverty is geographically concentrated in ruralareas, even though it is growing also in urban settlements (Hall, 2004; O ’Laughlin et al., 2013).
In Ladismith, more than a quarter of the population has no basic livelihood and relies on limited
subsidies from the government (Kannaland Municipality, 2020; Western Cape Government,2017). Most of the land is owned and cultivated by privileged whites, whilst black and coloured
people usually endure higher levels of poverty, unemployment and deteriorating ﬁnancial
conditions.
Agriculture is one of the major economic sectors of the Klein Karoo valley and employs about
30% of the workforce (Kannaland Municipality, 2020). Agricultural practices shifted from subsist-
ence agriculture during colonial times to commercial farming in the late twentieth century, whenLadismith became one of the biggest exporters of apricots and stone fruits in South Africa.

Figure 2 shows the ecological features that have been key for the development of these agriculturalactivities. Particularly crucial for its development were the valleys beneath the Swarthberg moun-tains, which according to South African geological studies were deep and fertile at least until the
beginning of the twentieth century (Cupido, 2005; Le Maitre et al., 2007; O ’Farrell et al., 2008).
Moreover, the vegetation was rich and very diverse (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008). The water
sources of the areas have been equally important in enabling agricultural activities. Figure 2(a)

sustained most of the socioeconomic development of the area. Figure 2(b) and (c) show that much
of the cultivated land is concentrated along smaller water courses like the Groot, Touws and
Buffelskloof rivers which ﬂow within the Gouritz catchment. Le Maitre et al. (2007) argue that
in the earliest parts of the twentieth century these rivers had a perennial stream ﬂow that supported
fertile wetlands. Overall Figure 2 serves to highlight the importance that these biophysical factors
had for the agricultural prosperity of the area.
Whilst agriculture is practiced by a large part of Ladismith ’s population, the bene ﬁts are reaped
by the white commercial farmers. This is because Ladismith ’s racial divide is re ﬂected in the organ-
isation of its agricultural sector. Although most of the landowners are white farmers, farmworkers
are mostly coloured or black people deprived of landownership and used as cheap labour(Piotrowski, 2019). Usually, coloured and black men are permanent farmworkers, whereas col-
oured or black women are more likely to be employed as seasonal labourers. These conditions,
point out the intersection of racial and gender inequalities in Ladismith ’s agricultural labour
which place black and coloured women in more precarious situations than men. Generally, farm-
workers and their family members face substandard housing conditions with limited water and sani-
tation services (Cordes et al., 2011). The minimum wage, 7 Rands per hour, is one of the lowestacross South African employment sectors (Cordes et al., 2011). Furthermore, the farmworkers ’
status is often exacerbated by exploitative and abusive practices perpetrated to various degrees
by (white) farm owners or managers (Lilja, 2019).
The processes of land and water dispossession that have reshaped Ladismith ’s
vulnerabilities
A key step in the establishment and later expansion of white commercial agriculture has been the
process of dispossession of the native population from the lands and the available water sources.The process of land dispossession was set in motion in 1652, when Dutch merchants settled on
the lands formerly inhabited by the pastoralists Khoikhoi and the hunter-gatherers San. The
Dutch and, since the nineteenth century also the British colonisers, settled in the area and seizedthe most fertile lands to farm (Piotrowski, 2019). During these centuries Europeans dispossessed,
exterminated, or enslaved the Khoikhoi and San communities whose numbers drastically shrank
(Cousins, 2016; Magubane, 1979; Piotrowski, 2019). Together with other black slaves fromother Southern African regions, the native communities were segregated on inconvenient and
smaller sized pieces of land (Piotrowski, 2019).
Land dispossession and territorial segregation became formally institutionalised via the Natives
Land Act in 1913 and subsequently the Native Trust and Land Acts in 1936. Through these two
pieces of legislation the colonial government set aside 13% of the land in South Africa to establish
reserves for the native population. These acts also prevented natives from buying and/or owningland outside these reserves. Ultimately, by removing the indigenous population from their land,
these laws dispossessed them of their water resources and allowed for recruitment of cheap
labour for mines and farming activities (Cousins, 2016). Processes of dispossession and exploit-ation of black labour enabled the extraction of economic surplus from mining and agricultural activ-
ities, which entirely bene ﬁted (white) land and mine owners (Legassick, 1974). Through the
twentieth century this capitalist form of production persisted and propelled a process of accumula-tion by dispossession whereby the labour force was subjected to extreme forms of extra-economic
coercion.
Over time, a combination of violence and legal mechanisms allowed colonial and apartheid
regimes to disempower and strategically proletarianise most of the black and coloured population.
Consequently, the natives were deprived of most of their ability to acquire new skills and seriously110 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
constrained their capability to improve their socio-economic conditions (Du Toit, 2004; Moseley,
2007). Through the process of land dispossession, European settlers have engendered chronic vul-
nerabilities within indigenous populations (Piotrowski, 2019), which became disproportionally sus-
ceptible to droughts relative to other privileged social groups.
As of today, despite the process of land restitution and redistribution initiated in 1994, the
unequal structure of South African land tenure persists and the precarious situations of rural liveli-
hoods have not improved. Overall, only 9% of farmlands have been transferred to the dispossessedpopulation, but many of these transfers are not fully implemented (Hall, 2004; Karriem and
Hoskins, 2016; O ’Laughlin et al., 2013). After more than 25 years of the post-Apartheid land
reforms, the agricultural sector remains dominated by white commercial farming (Cousins, 2016;Moseley, 2007). The legacy of land dispossession is also visible in Ladismith where most of the
lands are still owned by white farmers and, as one of the white farmers stated ‘farming is in our
blood and if anyone wish to take our land, they must also take us with it ’.
3
Land dispossession in South Africa went hand in hand with processes of water grabbing
(Marcatelli, 2018). During the British mandate, water became a private commodity granted by a
riparian law that linked the right of access to water with the ownership of the land. Peoplewithout land titles could only access water through court litigations. When this was not possible,
mostly due to ﬁnancial reasons, some would remain without water access even for drinking pur-
poses (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008). In the long term, these riparian rights further increased
socio-economic disparities (Marcatelli, 2018). Amid Apartheid these inequalities were further exa-
cerbated, as the South African government attempted to control water resources to sustain the
(white) national interests. In 1956, the Water Act attributed to the government the right tocontrol the water sources that were deemed necessary for the economic development of the
country (Le Maitre and O Farrell, 2008). This also included a right to expropriate land, including
native ones, for the development of water works and infrastructure (Tempelhoff, 2017).
After the end of Apartheid, public authorities attempted to establish some equity in the manage-
ment and distribution of water resources. In 1998, the Parliament of the South African Republic
approved a National Water Act which kept the government as the main custodian of water resourcesand set both equity and ef ﬁciency as key policy objectives (Tempelhoff, 2017). However, despite
the policy ’s intentions, water access in Ladismith remains very much linked to land ownership and
skewed along racial lines (Kemerink et al., 2011). The local irrigation boards continue to allocatewater based on the extent of the farmers ’land. As the head of an irrigation board in Ladismith
explains: ‘Some people are higher up in the system because they inherited the farms or because
they got them from well-known people and they were told: -These are your water rights! So,even if it is not really allowed by the Department of Water Affairs, they bought that farm and
they say these are my water rights ’.
4
Depending on the extensions and location of the land, some farmers have access to more reliable
and generous water sources relative to other less privileged ones. In some cases, the most privileged
farmers have built illegal dams and/or boreholes along the main riverbeds, signi ﬁcantly altering
downstream water ﬂow and reducing the amount of water available for other farmers. ‘Farmers
here are used to get water from the canals and then, all of a sudden, there is one guy that put
an irrigation pump in the river, and it is not legal and he cannot do that unless …’, as one of
farmer admitted, ‘you got enough money and you can change a lot of things ’.5Thus, privileged
access to land and reliable water sources allowed certain farmers to further increase their capital
by boosting their agricultural production and cultivating more pro ﬁtable crops with higher water
dependence like stone fruits, wine or vegetable seeds. The next section describes how, throughthe appropriation and commodi ﬁcation of nature, the narrow pursuit of pro ﬁt has disrupted the
metabolic exchanges that govern life and has produced a fundamental alienation of those who
do not have any control over such socioecological degradation, and that suffer the most from it.Savelli et al. 111
The development of white commercial agriculture and its socioecological implications
Ladismith ’s ecological and hydrological characteristics, alongside the processes of land and water
dispossession, have set the grounds for transforming sedentary farming into commercial agriculture
and enabling trade of agricultural products within international markets. Throughout the twentieth
century, the development of commercial agriculture has produced a metabolic rift, thereby irrevers-ibly modifying Ladismith ’s soil, vegetation, hydrology, microclimate and society.
In the beginning of the nineteenth century, colonisers were mostly interested in the mining
industry whilst only a few farmers were essentially occupied with raising sheep and cattle orgrowing subsistence crops. Only towards the second half of the nineteenth century, did the coloni-
sers’interest shift from mining to commercial agriculture. When the British took over, they allowed
free trading of agricultural products and thus triggered both the expansion as well as the diversi ﬁ-
cation of agricultural activities. Approximately around the 1870s, Little Karoo ’s agriculture intro-
duced tobacco, wool, and lucerne (alfalfa), whilst discovering its potential for the ostrich industry
(Figure 3).
Thereafter the agricultural sector experienced decades of instability due to national as well as
global crises such as the Great Depression and World War Two. Only in the 1950s, amid the
National Party administration, did South African agriculture bene ﬁt from substantial state interven-
tions and regulations which further increased the white farmers privileged position. The govern-
ment provided them funding and grants to further invest in agriculture and improve their
socio-economic condition. As described by the Ladismith Agri Chairman: ‘I grew up in a
country (where) if there was (any) trouble in the farming community the government would

across space. Source: adapted from Le Maitre and O ’Farrell (2008).112 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
come and help you get through it. (In case of) ﬂood, diseases, or any disaster, [ …] the government
(would always) help ’.6Beside securing lands and natural resources for white farmers, the Apartheid
South African state invested in infrastructure such as railways, dams or irrigation canals, and pro-
vided ﬁnancial support to facilitate the expansion of agricultural production and the diversi ﬁcation
of agricultural products. Consequently, alongside the extreme racialisation of Ladismith ’s agricul-
tural sector, state intervention boosted livestock and crop production which severely degraded most
of Ladismith ’s lands in terms of nutrients as well as biodiversity (Cupido, 2005; Le Maitre et al.,
2007, 2009a, 2009b; Murray, 2015; O ’Farrell et al., 2008).
Various environmental studies have measured changes in the conditions of the soil through ﬁeld
assessment, data sampling and spatial analysis of satellite images (Smith-Adao et al., 2011). Thesestudies report that before the expansion of commercial agriculture (i.e., at the beginning of the twen-
tieth century) Ladismith ’s valleys were considered still fertile and covered with dense biological
soil crusts (Le Maitre et al., 2007). Biocrust is essential in stabilizing the conditions of the soilfor it can reduce wind and water erosion, in ﬂuence the balance between overland water ﬂow and
inﬁltration, and increase soil fertility (Belnap et al., 2004; Bowker, 2007; Le Maitre et al.,
2007). However, the unsustainable grazing practices and intensive crop cultivation, have graduallydamaged this biocrust, depleted the soil from its nutrients, increased its erosion and subsequently
reduced the groundwater and surface water ﬂows (Cupido, 2005; Hoffman, 2014; Murray, 2015;
O’Farrell et al., 2008). Once the soil reaches this level of degradation, the water that usually per-
colates through the soil and recharges groundwater sources, would instead runoff over the
surface and evaporate more easily. In the long term, an insuf ﬁcient recharge of groundwater
might reduce the amount of available water, whilst the socioecological transformations of thesoil could potentially reduce evapotranspiration and result in drier micro-climatic conditions
(Van Loon and Van Lanen, 2012).
In addition, the same environmental studies report that over the second half of the twentieth
century the expansion of commercial agriculture has also caused a considerable loss of vegetation
cover and a decrease in biodiversity relative to the ﬁrst half of the century (Cupido, 2005; Hoffman,
2014; Le Maitre et al., 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Murray, 2015; O ’Farrell et al., 2008). A spatial analysis
of satellite images (Smith-Adao et al., 2011) found that besides fynbos in the mountainous areas,
Ladismith vegetation has been almost entirely transformed in cultivated areas and/or used for live-
stock (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4, about 80 to 90% of the thicket and shrubland has beenseverely to moderately degraded by grazing activities, whilst another 10 to 20% has been trans-
formed for cultivation (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008).
The vegetation and soil degradation further intensi ﬁed throughout the latest political
regime, when the agricultural sector experien ced increasing deregulation and market liberal-
isation. In the 1980s, the governments embrace d a market-oriented ide ology, which was for-
malised with the 1995 White Paper on Agricultu re. On paper, this policy aimed at building a
strong economy and reducing inequalities by inc reasing income and employment opportunity
for the poor (Viljoen, 2005). In practice, the new law phased out the government ’s protective
measures and subsidies, deregulated the secto r, and liberalised the trade in agricultural
products.
Since then, neoliberal policies have prepared the sector for international markets to the point that
today ‘[i]t is all market oriented and lead by the market ’.
7As a South African researcher con ﬁrmed,
Ladismith ’s agriculture ‘is mostly about economic indicators, the strength of the currency, and the
trade agreement that we have with other countries ’.8Consequently, to reach the international
market and remain competitive, farmers had to convert their grain crops into cultivations thatwere more appealing to international markets. Yet international markets often preferred crops
which required more water, such as grapes and stone fruits, relative to other less appealing cultiva-
tions. However, the surplus derived from these exports was not equally spread amongst the farmers.Savelli et al. 113
Only those who could access more land and additional water were able to expand their production
to more water dependent crops, reach international markets, and keep their pro ﬁt margins. ‘Over
time’, con ﬁrms a successful farmer, ‘we have managed to build some dams and changed the
way we irrigate. By being more ef ﬁcient our production increased. Before we were cultivating
lucerne, now also grapes and stone fruits ’.9
Yet, whilst improving irrigation ef ﬁciencies and boosting agricultural production for some, these
neoliberal measures also induced a sharp rise in the input prices, more ﬁnancial pressure, and higher
competition amongst the farmers, who felt abandoned by the government. With the hollowing out
of the state, farmers lost an essential support for their agricultural activities. Some were signi ﬁcantly
affected by increased transport costs which inevitably reduced their pro ﬁt margins. Moreover,
Ladismith ’s farmers were also less productive and competitive relative to others across the
Western Cape. In fact, the semi-arid environment, together with the high rainfall variability, and
recurring droughts constrained the ability of Ladismith farmers to regularly achieve high yields.On several occasions, farmers had to rely on bank loans or, in the worst cases, they declared bank-
ruptcy and sold their land. Often these lands were acquired by the most ef ﬁcient and af ﬂuent
farmers of the area, who became more powerful by accumulating additional land and increasingtheir pro ﬁt margins. Thus, even though the number of farmers and farmworkers have been declin-
ing, the hectares cultivated remain fairly stable (Liebenberg et al., 2010; Murray, 2015). This means
that the bene ﬁts of white commercial agriculture have been largely accumulated by the most suc-
cessful farmers for which the pro ﬁts have doubled. In fact, as Murray (2015: 35) claims, in
Ladismith: ‘it’s a case of the strongest will survive ’.
Figure 4. Levels of land degradation in the Klein Karoo area within the Gouritz river Catchment including:
pristine, moderate and severely transformed landSource: adapted from Smith-Adao et al., 2011).114 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
Ultimately, the process that made Ladismith one of the biggest exporter of stone fruits in South
Africa, exerted an increasing pressure on Ladismith ’s land and soil, alongside exacerbating the vul-
nerability of the farmworkers and the less ‘successful ’farmers. Whilst attractive for international
markets, this highly-intensive and industrialised agriculture, became even less sustainable as thesoil became less fertile, the vegetation shrank, and the water resources dwindled, due to the shift
to water intensive crops. Figure 3 clearly points out the latest agricultural changes that have grad-
ually increased the water dependency of Ladismith ’s crops, especially in the last decade. Hence,
alongside degrading Ladismith ’s soil and vegetation, commercial agriculture also profoundly
altered Ladismith ’s hydrology.
Smith-Adao et al. (2011) reported that in 2000, the water demand in the entire Gouritz river
catchment surpassed the available yield
10by 10%. Since then, the level of water extraction
remained so high that almost no perennial ﬂow was left on the watercourses to ensure the life of
local ecosystems. Figure 5 indicates that the ecosystem of the Buffelskloof, Groot and Touwsrivers were moderately to severely endangered, and the rivers were at risk of completely or partially
drying up. The stream ﬂow that used to run through those rivers has been dammed, diverted into
irrigation channels, and over-exploited for agricultural purposes, mostly through ﬂood irrigation
methods that require a considerable amount of water (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008; Nel et al.,
2011; Nongwe, 2008; Petersen et al., 2017; Smith-Adao et al., 2011). Groundwater resources
have also been overexploited. Without accounting for illegal boreholes, registered users havebeen extracting more than 50% of the water recharge (Le Maitre et al., 2009a, 2009b).

Unsustainable farming also affected the water quality of the catchments which has been deterior-
ating throughout the years. In fact, the return ﬂow from irrigated areas in the Groot,
Buffelskloof, and Touws catchments has also increased the rivers ’natural salinity (Le Maitre
and O ’Farrell, 2008). As Figure 5 shows, most of the local rivers were already drying up in the
years around 2010. Thus, they became more vulnerable to rainfall variability, and therefore increas-
ingly prone to future droughts (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008; Smith-Adao et al., 2011).
The socioecological epilogue of Ladismith ’s drought
Droughts and water shortages have affected Ladismith since the beginning of the twentieth century
(Joubert, 1931) for the town is located in a semi-arid region (Figure 6) which experiences recurring
peaks of below-average yearly rainfall. Figure 7 displays the irregular rainfall timeseries with anaverage of 300 mm/year which shows the critically low levels of precipitation the town receives
throughout the year. However, Ladismith experiences both intense rainfall events and extremely
dry periods which often result in major destructive ﬂoods (i.e.,1981, 2003, and 2014) and droughts
(i.e., 1920, 1930, 1960s, 1970s, 1997 –2000, 2009 –2011), with signi ﬁcant negative impacts for both
the population and the agricultural sector (Le Maitre and O ’Farrell, 2008).
Despite the familiarity with extreme weather events, the 2015 –2019 meteorological drought
(Figure 7, grey bar) constituted an unprecedented shock for the local population. Most of the
farmers in the area describe this drought as the worst they have ever experienced
11. Media headlines
have depicted the study area as stricken orravaged by the latest drought (Charlers, 2019; Felem,
2018). However, hydroclimatological explanations of drought hazard indicate that a meteorological
drought does not always result in a socioecological crisis. As discussed in the section
Hydroclimatological understandings of drought , a meteorological drought will propagate into a
soil moisture drought, evolve into a hydrological drought and eventually produce a socioecological
Figure 6. The Primary Catchment of the study area showing the Köppen-Geiger climatic classi ﬁcations
(Beck et al., 2018). The catchment straddles the semi-desert region of the Great Karroo (the north portion)
and Little Karoo (the inter-mountain portion in where the town of Ladismith is found). The Köppen-Geiger
provides an indication of the environmental boundaries in terms of precipitation and heat, with the study areabeing dominated by low precipitation and mixture of hot and cold temperatures. As a result, there are fewperennial rivers and no naturally occurring surface water bodies. At present the catchment is dominated bycold desert conditions (pink shading).

crisis only when affecting a vulnerable environment. Thus, the propagation of a drought hazard
event into such a dire socioecological crisis can only be explained by considering the historical pro-cesses that have co-produced Ladismith ’s socioecological vulnerability.
Here, the meteorological drought which started in 2015 did evolve into a severe soil moisture
drought which shrivelled most of Ladismith ’s arable lands. The soil moisture drought was
indeed triggered by the reduction of precipitation, yet it manifested with that intensity because
Ladismith ’s land was already degraded by the agricultural transformations that had occurred
since the second half of the twentieth century. Over time, the intensive crop cultivation haddamaged the biocrust and in turn, increased the erosion alongside reducing the fertility of the
soil. In addition, cultivations and grazing activities had also considerably curtailed Ladismith ’s
vegetation cover thereby exposing the land to further degradation. To reveal stress and changesrelated to the soil moisture drought, Figure 8 uses the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) which
is derived through a spatial analysis of satellite images. The ﬁgure displays a general EVI reduction
across the study area especially after 2017. This analysis also highlights that the cultivated areas,with a lower EVI value, were much more affected by the soil moisture drought relative to the
other vegetation. With these harsher conditions, the soil was neither able to absorb or maintain
the water required for crops and vegetation to grow, nor was there suf ﬁcient water available to
recharge aquifers or surface water. The heavy and extensive modi ﬁcation of local vegetation
along with the degradation of the soil have very likely increased the severity of the soil moisture
drought. As a farmworker observed: ‘Everything (was) dying …Even the bush of the Karoo, that
is a tough plant, (could not) stand anymore, it (was) also dying …’
12
In turn, the soil moisture drought quickly unfolded into an extreme hydrological drought. The
once perennial stream ﬂow of Ladismith ’s surface water sources, the Touws, Groot, and
Buffelskloof rivers, dried up almost completely (Figure 6(d) and (e)). According to Ladismith ’s
population, rivers and wetlands were drier than ever. A farmer recounts that the Buffelskloof
river was never empty before, but since the last drought it dried up ‘just like sand ’13. Instead of
water, riverbeds were accumulating sand and the little amount of water left was not suf ﬁcient to
sustain the plants, animals and micro-organisms of the river ecosystem. Yet not long before the
drought, many Ladismith families could ﬁsh in those rivers or allow their cattle to eat green
reeds along the riverbeds. In addition, since 2016 farmers received only one, instead of twelve,
dam releases from the major regional reservoir, the Floriskraal Dam.14,15The Irrigation board

regulating and controlling water allocations, started rationing and later on suspended the water
releases as there was not enough water left in the Dam. Even the private dams used by farmers
drained completely and many boreholes stopped providing regular and continuous yields.
Consequently, farmers struggled to sustain their activities and labour force. Our analysis revealsthat this dire manifestation of hydrological drought cannot be attributed to the precipitation
alone, but must be seen in relation to the intensive agricultural development that has completely
altered the local hydrology through the construction of arti ﬁcial canals, dams, and boreholes,
along with unsustainable levels of water abstraction (Le Maitre et al. 2009a, 2009b, Le Maitre
and O ’Farrell 2008; Nel et al. 2011; Nongwe 2008; Petersen et al. 2017, Smith-Adao et al. 2011).
As a result, in 2018 after a few years of below average rainfall, Ladismith plunged into an
extreme socioecological crisis from which the population has not yet recovered (see Figure 9).
The crisis was so far-reaching as to require humanitarian interventions. International and local orga-
nisations like Gift of the Givers and South African Water Warriors supported the municipality or thefarmers most in need of water, food and fodder. Since 2018, the Western Cape Province also sup-
ported the affected communities with drought relief in the form of fodder for livestock.
Figure 8. Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of the Ladismith area (same extent as Figure 2(c) using MODIS
16-day product from 10/11 June of the respective year. Darker greens represent greater vegetation activity,open water and bare soil which have low EVI values. T wo pre-drought years (2013 and 2014) show little yearon year change. In 2015, the drought onset, some reduction in greenness is seen in the river channels only,however by 2017 there appears to be a general reduction in EVI across the region, including the areas of
natural vegetation. However, areas of natural vegetation display less decrease in Enhanced Vegetation Index
than human modi ﬁed and cultivated areas. Vegetation activity begins to increase in 2019 and continues in
2020. Of interest is the increased EVI of the Floriskraal dam between 2016 to 2018 and a decrease again in2019. As EVI is low for open water, this EVI increase suggested a decrease in the surface water extent, andsubsequent vegetation growth, in across these three years, with 2019 seeing the return to open water
conditions close to the dam walls. This decrease and then increase water supply are also displayed in the
farming areas to Calitzdorp along the Gamka River.Source: Modis, (2021).118 EPE: Nature and Space 8(1)
Institutions, the media, and the general public presented the farmers as the most affected com-
munity. The chairman of the Agri-Ladismith Board warned that more than half of the farmers were
inﬁnancial trouble. Many of them, including the biggest producers, declared bankruptcy and put
their farms up for auction. The agricultural board estimates that toward the end of 2019 farmers ’
annual unpaid loans amount to 300 Million Rands. From 2017 until 2019, lucerne producers lost
about 2300 hectares of harvest, equivalent to 250 Million Rands. Stone fruit cultivators experienced
up to 70% of harvest loss and many of their productive orchards have died off or had to be uprooted.Several vineyards have faced similar losses. The dairy industry has stopped milking and numerous
farmers decided to sell off their livestock to the meat industry (Ladismith Agri, 2019). For some
farmers it has been amongst ‘the most humiliating experience ’
16of their life, many others felt
powerless17and waited for a ‘miracle ’18that would bring them ‘the resources and the capital
needed to invest, and get labour going on again ’.19In some instances, newspapers have also
reported cases of suicide amongst farmers that lost hope and capacity to face such desperate con-ditions (Patrick, 2019).
At the same time, this discursive construction of the drought conceals the privileged conditions
of some farmers and the experiences of the most vulnerable and marginalised population. Indeed,although the drought has affected farmers like never before, as time progresses some are slowly
developing alternative strategies to survive. In fact, whilst few were prepared to leave the
country, others have improved their farming technology, switched to less water-intensive crops,invested into new boreholes or started a new business. For them, the crisis ultimately represented
an opportunity to reinvigorate their activities and eventually their surplus. Landless workers,
however, could not rely on the same resources and opportunities to mitigate the impacts of thedrought on their livelihood. Hence, over 1400 farmworkers (of which 800 were seasonal) lost
their job and their main source of income.
The impacts of the drought were even more severe for migrants coming from neighbouring
countries who have limited rights and receive less support from the local government.
20In
general, the living conditions of farmworkers in Ladismith, and South Africa, have always been
difﬁcult and at times inhumane, yet the drought has further exacerbated farmworkers ’vulnerabil-
ities. As a seasonal worker recounts ‘before [the drought] everything was ﬁne. I could support my
family here, send my children to school, support my family in Zimbabwe. But as I ’m speaking right
now I am stressed because I cannot do that anymore as I ’m not working. And I do not want that. So,
my hope is that one day everything is [going to be] normal and that we [will]start working again.
That is my wish ’.21
To survive the crisis, those farmworkers and their families that lived in the farms ended up
sharing a small shack (less than 25 m2) made of wood, aluminium or other salvaged material,
with other families. Many had to live on a state subsidy disbursed to the elderly or sick people
within the household (up to 1750 Rands/month). Others asked for support from other familymembers or were forced to accept working conditions that are signi ﬁcantly worse than before
the crisis (e.g., 44 Rands/day). Most of the farmworkers are forced to endure these very harsh con-
ditions which barely support their basic needs. ‘[Farmers] keep on saying that they don ’t have
money to pay us, but they expect us to do a full job. And look at the wages that I earn at the
end of the day …It’s not even what I ’m supposed to get. It ’s very bad ’.
22
When media and institutions framed the drought as a tragedy for Ladismith ’s farmers and their
agricultural activities, they indirectly contributed to make the suffering of farmworkers and their
families almost invisible, thereby aggravating their disadvantaged conditions. Thus, their vulner-
ability to drought was not just material but also a discursive process of Ladismith ’s socioecological
history. Overall, our exploration of the materiality of drought illustrated how the drought was both a
product of historical dispossession and discrimination and one of the material conditions of the soil,
vegetation, hydrology and microclimate. In Marx words, Ladismith ’s advances in agriculturalSavelli et al. 119

productivity not only ‘robbed the workers but also the soil ’, vegetation, hydrology and microcli-
mate of the area (Aslamy, 2021). Through violent expropriation, slavery and ecological destruction,
the narrow pursuit of pro ﬁt and capital accumulation in Ladismith caused a fundamental disruption
between nature and society which eventually transformed the drought into a socioecological crisis.
Conclusion: the materiality of drought
In this paper, we have re-conceptualised droughts as socioecological phenomena coproduced by the
recursive engagement of different human and non-human transformations. The interdisciplinary
integration of political ecology, geographies of materiality and hydroclimatology, has generatednew questions and forms of knowledge on the material and discursive worlds of droughts. We
note three signi ﬁcant contributions of this approach to advance understandings of the materiality
of drought.
First, an engagement with hydroclimatology served to further a critical geography of drought
that is more attuned to the biophysical processes that coproduce droughts and their resulting socio-
ecological crises. Our conceptual-methodological approach offers a novel way to broaden post-humanist perspectives in the ﬁeld of drought hazard and beyond. Advancing what we termed the
materiality of drought, we shed light on the way multiple, interwoven biophysical agents matter
in socioecological transformations and drought-related crises. By enabling and constraining dis-tinctive social processes, biophysical agents play an active role in reshaping uneven landscapes
of environmental and social vulnerability. As shown in Ladismith, non-human processes have
co-produced the drought hazard and transformed the reduction in rainfall of 2015 –2019 into a
severe socioecological crisis. At the same time, we show that the materiality of water, soil,
climate and vegetation is always more than physical and historically contingent. Drought material-
ity is co-produced by human practices, wider political processes, and uneven economic develop-ment. The ‘messy and porous interpenetration ’(Moore, 2017: 308) between human and
non-human natures re ﬂects a social power that does not act upon nature, but rather develops
through socioecological relations. Thus, based on our empirical account, we argue that our interdis-ciplinary approach reveals how non-humans matter in the way (uneven) social relations unfold
(Lima Costa et al., 2017; Whatmore, 2002).
Second, building on this point, our interdisciplinary approach also entailed a reconsideration and
reframe of the spatiotemporal and empirical focus of the analysis. This novel perspective enabled
the reconceptualisation of drought hazard as a complex and long-term process rather than a static
condition. Analytically, this engagement led us to broaden the focus beyond the time of water scar-city and transcend the manifestation of the event itself. By reconnecting nature and society through
a critical history of the coevolution of human and non-human processes, this work traced the
making of the metabolic rift at the origin of Ladismith ’s socioecological disruption. In this way,
the paper serves to demonstrate not just how ecology and society co-evolved to produce a speci ﬁc
droughtscape, but also how the making of the society-nature distinction itself formed part of this
political history.
This brings us to our last point, concerning our contribution to the social production of water
scarcity. Political ecology has mostly considered or de ﬁned droughts as the social construction
or production of water scarcity. In this paper, we have proposed a political ecology approachthat is more attentive to the materiality and the active role of biophysical processes in the production
of droughts and socioecological crises. We contend that without such speci ﬁc understanding, pol-
itical ecologists overlook the agency of non-human elements alongside their social entanglements.Our novel conceptualisation considers drought as co-produced by human and non-human processes
thereby showing that the social production of water scarcity alone cannot fully explain the politicsSavelli et al. 121
of drought and its injustice. Capturing the power dynamics and the political changes that intersect
with drought also requires retracing the agency of its non-human processes.
Highlights
Conceptualizing drought as socially constructed water scarcity may conceal the productive role
of the biophysical processes co-producing drought.
Hydro-climatology expands the focus of drought ’s analyses beyond the time of water scarcity
and transcends the manifestation of the event itself.
Through an historical perspective, the materiality of drought traces the making of the metabolic
rift at the origin of Ladismith ’s socioecological disruption.
Ladismith ’s soil, vegetation, hydrology and microclimate, have contributed to reshape an uneven
socionatural landscape.
Understanding the power dynamics that intersect with drought hazard requires retracing the
agency of its non-human processes.
