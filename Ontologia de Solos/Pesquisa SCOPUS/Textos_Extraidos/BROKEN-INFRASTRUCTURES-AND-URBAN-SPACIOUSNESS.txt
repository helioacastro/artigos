— BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURES AND URBAN 
SPACIOUSNESS (COMPASSION)
AbdoumAliq Simone
Abstract
Compassion in urban settings is manifested less as a definitive practice than as a 
panoply of spatial and temporal orientations that lend uncertainty to the dispositions of 
actions and events. This is an uncertainty that can be either generative or debilitating, and 
it is difficult to predict which in advance. Thus, apertures and opportunities can appear 
beyond the consideration of eligibility or preparedness, and there can be a refusal of the 
terms on offer. In this way, the intersections of bodies, materials, built environments and 
political structures can generate unanticipated opportunities amid what otherwise seem 
to be innumerable foreclosures.
Introduction
Naples in its stereotypical representations exudes chaos, a panoply of fragments 
and the predominance of the illicit. Although Gomorrah, one of Italy’s most popular 
television shows, does not stray far from these stereotypes, in its third season the 
consolidation of the illicit becomes a lens onto the ways in which built environments 
in their often ambiguous temporalities embody improbable possibilities and hopes. Its 
landscape of empty churches, abandoned factories and warehouses, dilapidated housing 
projects and seaside resorts, unused parking garages and jettisoned construction sites 
becomes a platform through which a supposedly vanquished Camorra don relaunches 
a career, repurposing these spatial products as an integrated urban economy, as places 
to hide the storage and transactions in narcotics, seed small enterprises to launder the 
illicit gains, conduct secret meetings among actors who are not supposed to get along, 
all as an extended fabric of surprise, of a city constantly moving on.
Not dissimilarly in the supposedly vanquished peripheries of Naples and 
Athens, Chinese factories producing garments, cheap handicrafts and electrical parts 
forge an autonomous industrial zone under the radar. Likewise, the Parisian suburbs 
reaching outwards from Gare du Nord become a parallel city with their improvised 
real estate systems that house the barely documented, that operate as the interfaces 
and intersections among various diasporic commercial activities, all under the pretense 
of being car washes, petrol stations, box stores, delivery services, auto parts markets, 
recycling centers and truck parts. These are the back doors into a larger world, of 
goods and services moving outside official channels, of ethnicities being sutured into 
provisional complicities. Here, a ‘strange’ urban geography emerges where it is not clear 
what things are, what they do or what form they take (Simone, 2022b). The apparent 
function of things, the ghostly specters of their past identities, shimmer into a blurred 
network of connections, both inviting and circumventing new modalities of urban 
control. But what might we make of such strangeness? What does it point to?
One possible response is to fold its consideration into the recent attention that 
has been placed on so-  called infrastructures of care (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015; Alam 
and Houston, 2020), all of those entanglements of social practice, material affordance 
and spatial design capable of sustaining a viable enunciation of life and liveliness. It also 
points to extensivity of the work performed to ensure both the direct maintenance of 
such liveliness and the platforms on which it takes place: all of the transformative work

required in order to convert specific material formations into affordances and to sustain 
that materiality over time in face of its potential depletion. The usual and familiar tropes 
of caring enroll metaphors of solidity, nurturance or compassion. It often seems obvious 
as to what caring looks and feels like. It is often considered the purview of or particularly 
exemplified by specific gendered practices and domains —that is, the caring mother of 
the hearth. Care is physically demonstrated by acts of holding as a physics of support and 
comfort; an act of physical intimacy that momentarily relieves the individual from having 
to stand all on their own, to bear the weight of the world. But like every extension of one 
to another, the holding bears its own risk, its own dangers of becoming acts that hold 
up, in the sense of interdict, forestall or interrupt a sense of motion (Berlant, 2016). The 
hold veers on becoming a baseline that defines specific trajectories of expected future 
behavior or attainment, that from which the value of an existence is to be measured, a 
starting point that assigns a value to that which has come before and which can only be 
redeemed, considered significant, if particular care is taken in how one proceeds.
Stiegler (2017) extends these considerations by reaffirming the need for thinking 
care-  fully, a thought that is directed towards what he calls the pharmacological 
dimensions of conventional modalities of taking care, of holding. He demonstrates the 
ways in which that which is purportedly ‘good for us’ is also a form of ‘poison’, and that 
these aspects are inextricable and must be navigated carefully to break open the hold that 
particular arrangements have on us. At the same time, we must mobilize that breakage, 
momentary though it may be, as an opening onto a new horizon of everyday thought and 
practices. For Stiegler, the future has been pre- programmed by digital calculation and 
thus is cancelled or pre-  empted as it is folded into the present as a specific outcome. He 
argues that the entropic forms of calculation circumscribe the capacity to extend into and 
through the world and thus disable the capacity to care (Bishop and Ross, 2021).
In this essay, I want to reflect on the compassion of brokenness, of imaginaries 
of care that do not rely on a sense of organic wholeness or encompassment. This is 
particularly important in supplementing the depiction of intensified precarity for a 
particularly youthful population with a series of implicit affordances embedded in that 
same condition. For in many Southern urban latitudes, a younger generation of residents 
is situated in the midst of nascent residential/commercial landscapes that are unlikely 
to consolidate into any substantive platform of accumulation or social reproduction —
former territories of belonging that are broken, leaving only remnants of materials and 
relations. Their lives mediate situations that will never be sufficient and those that are 
no longer sufficient. They occupy an interstitial positioning that exposes them to vast 
uncertainty and incessant and short- term opportunism.
At the same time, these landscapes of remnants and incompletion offer a 
generosity of possibility because in each disposition there is in actuality, as opposed 
to claims and ideological framing, an absence of integrity. These are settings where 
the likely foreclosure of either repair or completion means that there is little to defend 
and little specification as to how the materials and relations that ensue ought to be 
used. The very profusion of non-  subsumed details becomes materials of provisional 
rearrangement, where bits and pieces of family and other affinal ties, locations, 
infrastructures, institutional positions and income streams are interwoven into the 
making of mobile territories of operation.
Let me tell a small story from Jakarta to illustrate these points. Ridwan at 28 years 
of age already dreams of a retirement that will never come, as his life is ensconced in 
a multitude of temporary engagements across geographical circuits that become ever 
more extended. Every day he returns to his family’s original neighborhood of Mampang 
in Jakarta’s urban core with orders from neighbors in their present location in the 
distant periphery of Cileungsi for a variety of foods and artisanal goods. These will be 
momentarily stored on a friend’s balcony in a social housing project in nearby Tanah 
Tinggi, where Ridwan will pick up small packets of shabu shabu (methamphetamine)

that he will distribute to salespersons at an old shopping mall in Cempaka during their 
lunch breaks. On the way he will pick up his seven-  year-  old son from school and deliver 
him to his mother, who works in the mall, just in time for her cousin to pick him up 
and take him back to her parents’ house, where she now stays in order to be closer to 
work. Ridwan will then rush to yet another side of the city near the major market of 
Tanah Abang, where his brother tends a small clothing outlet. Ridwan will help him 
arrange deliveries of jeans that have been made in small cottage industries in Tanah 
Sereal outside of the official commodity circuits. The brothers have invested the drug 
profits in rehabilitating several old shophouses into dormitory rooms for young migrant 
workers employed in the hundreds of small clothing factories. A sister, Ami, manages 
the upkeep of these koskosans (rooming houses), but she is also often on the run from 
an abusive husband, hiding out in Mampang at the flat of a distant cousin, who now is 
working in another city. Often Ridwan must recruit short- term cleaners and security 
guards for these facilities, so he frequently scours the back lanes back in Tanah Tinggi 
for cheap labor. Thus, his days are a constant relay of picking things up and putting 
them down, of going here to there, destinations like puzzle pieces in a vast network of 
fragmented ties —family members spread out across different geographies and small-  
scale livelihoods, across a variety of dramas and exigencies. Ridwan mobilizes and 
maneuvers a large cast of characters, and where he is just a bit less precarious than them.
Instead of viewing these partial, loose ties among remnants and incompletions 
solely as signs of the unraveling of coherence, rights and sociality, they also accord a form 
of compassionate leave. By this I mean a way in which persons might take leave of their 
senses, take leave of the obligations to demonstrate rational or coherent trajectories of 
self-  development and take leave of the imperative to become something in particular. At 
the same time, they curate lives that are also specific in the sense of both ‘saying’ something 
about how urban conditions are read, assessed and hedged and being untranslatable into 
some overarching generalization or pattern. Here, specificity is the determination to 
convert that which has been dispossessed and broken into potential affordances, the 
refusal to ‘play by the rules’ and a concession to the provisional as a way of operating.
Without clear maps about how the shards and the incompletions of his 
itineraries and resources are to be used or repurposed, Ridwan exemplifies how the 
urban materializes a sense of compassion even as his vulnerability may be intensified. 
Yet, if specific libidinal attachments remain salient in relationships to family, household, 
community and state, what happens as particular roles and responsibilities are refused, 
even if not necessarily broken? What happens when detachment, rather than indicating 
social breakdown or disintegration, simply signals a tacit refusal to ‘tie up’ one’s desires 
into the expected formats? For example:
What happens to the desires for familial affection when fathers refuse to attach 
themselves to the purportedly normative behaviors that constitute fatherhood; 
what happens when women concretely manifest indifference to the presence of 
men as an integral aspect of household composition? What happens when the 
role of ‘worker’ no longer provides a valorized basis through which individuals 
identify themselves and their worth? What happens when localities refuse to 
reflect compliance to the prevailing standards of viability? How and to what 
extent are familiar obligations recalibrated in new terms or simply refused 
altogether? What kinds of arrangements mark a detachment from the normative 
tropes of socialization, and then seek to compensate for the implications of such 
detachment? Here, brokenness outlines a plane of other possible maneuvers 
that shift from compensations for difficult situations to their outright refusal 
(Simone, 2022a: 274).
What does this mean for urban politics?

BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURES AND URBAN SPACIOUSNESS (COMPASSION)978
The provisional reshaping of the dispossessed
Urban politics has largely been about mediating the oscillating needs to define 
the dispositions of the present and to relinquish that control in favour of the improbable 
(Farias and Blok, 2016). For the productivity of urban spatial expansion was viewed 
largely in terms of synergistic connections —country to city, local ecologies and resources 
to urban regions —and to set things in motion, to propel and distribute. Identifications 
and functions had to be unsettled to enable their availability and resettlement in new 
constellations of use. Thus, the consolidation of scale, the subsumption of things within 
a voluminous rubric, always required dispossession, dispossession of land, livelihoods, 
ways of living and potentiality. Here, the urban consolidates itself as determiner of 
proportionality, about who counts and in what way, who is eligible for specific 
designations of value. Such consolidation was not simply a formatting, an assignation 
of predefined roles and functions, but also had to allow the components to experiment 
with their relations with each other so as to minimize friction and the possibilities of 
dissipation (McNeill, 2020). The consolidation of scale and volume was something 
that could never be settled once and for all, so the appearance of such, the inclination 
to settle urban questions and populations, remained a ruse, a necessary deception  
(Billé, 2020).
This unsettlement is important to keep in mind, for although Cowen (2020) 
tells us that voluminous reproduction has long been predicated on theft, dispossession 
also has a specifically experimental quality. For what is uprooted, plundered and made 
available is not simply plugged into some new function as an intact entity. Rather, the 
processes of unsettling and dispossessing ‘plays with’ those that are dispossessed in 
order to figure out what the resultant instability could do in relation to emergent forms 
of value creation and economic development. Making things available constitutes a 
moment of indecision, where the ‘writing in’ of the dispossessed to new configurations 
of inhabitation could veer off into unanticipated futures. Here, an urban politics might 
emerge that is not directed towards either reversing dispossession or repossessing, but 
towards using the moment of dispossession to prefigure or predispose the available 
unbodying of the dispossessed to forms of gathering, sensing and living that do not 
fully complete the process of resocialization in the terms imposed by the hegemonic 
apparatuses of political rule, infrastructure, accumulation and territorial administration.
There are always dispositions which might be taking place that either don’t 
surface or for which we don’t have the words or cognition to recognize, to discern from 
complex patterns of power. As Jane Doe walks the heavily commercialized street full of 
neon lights and traffic near midnight crying inconsolably, there is no clear ontogenesis 
of these tears. To be sure, she may have just broken up with a lover whom she found 
had been cheating on her, but she also traverses the thick affects of the street exuding 
the struggles and tears of a myriad of actants. The tears might have been withheld if not 
for the heavy pollution in the air or the stress of roadside hawkers desperate to make 
a few bucks before the two- hour commute home. The tears might have been further 
precipitated by the digital news on a towering billboard announcing that the death toll 
in Gaza had just exceeded 40,000 or might be attenuated by fond memories when she 
sees in a bakery window a cake like the one her mother had bought her when she was 
little. There are interminable lines of implication too overwhelming for any cogitating 
body, all which curate atmospherics of existence that are neither good nor bad, that are 
beyond the exigencies of acting in the next moment, where decisions must be made 
about what to pay attention to and how those decisions are frequently made for one in 
ways that are incomprehensible in that moment.
Here, proportion, the relative weight of causes and effects, is an imposition on 
the city, a disciplinary effort to order it in ways that implicitly accord a specific value to 
the thoughts and feelings experienced. Here, compassion is the possibility of getting lost 
in a city thoroughly signposted, where digital maps guide the traveler to any location

through a plurality of possible itineraries, and where there is an implicit equivalence of 
all places but an unbodied equivalence constituted by graphemes rather than smells or 
sounds. This is an inhabitation disinterested in the reigning genre of our humanity, but 
rather impels an inclination towards a succession of passings- by where every moment is 
available for something to happen beyond the confines of its infrastructural signification. 
It is rather an inhuman enactment that exceeds discernment, for everything becomes 
unrecognizable yet meaningful in terms that are never yet to come but are somehow 
eminently familiar even as they have never transpired before. It is an eerie form of an 
aesthetic arithmetic which suggests that whatever appears in front of us is always ‘less 
than’ and ‘more than’ at the same time. This, in turn, is life’s priority.
The urban has always exhibited complex and contradictory moral economies as 
applied to defining collective goods and interest, as well as undertaking often onerous 
interventions in the name of such collective interest. Here, compassion is not an 
exclusive human phenomenon but is embedded within the intricate choreographies 
and architectures of the urban itself —as almost an infrastructural feature. While we 
might grasp such capacity exclusively within the itineraries and trajectories of residents 
who endure without measure or reason, who manage to circumvent the otherwise 
immanent disasters that await them, we might garner evidence of a compassion within 
how built, social, material and spectral environments concretize a sense of generosity 
and openness.
Far from being an outgrowth or implication, everything that transpires works 
from all that precedes or follows it. And these are not simply the identifiable categories of 
history, personality and contextual situation, but also a process that is always under way, 
with innumerable gestations, gestures and incipience that go undetectable yet respond 
to the entirety of the world in a present moment, and which perhaps make themselves 
present with unprecedented specificity. Here, whatever happens, laden with power 
though it may be, always occurs within the simultaneity of many other events. Each 
exerts impacts beyond the locales and boundaries that would structure their relevance 
and the ways in which they would be conventionally attended to (Simone, 2018). In 
many urban settings, particularly in the global South, inhabitants frequently assumed 
the risk that the unprogrammed and often unruly exchanges among them, and with their 
relationships with the materials at hand, might generate more virtuous dispensations, 
even if they were hard- pressed to prove it.
For the relations of contiguity among physically proximate territories are 
characterized by pronounced and shifting boundaries that are not easily describable 
through recourse to the familiar attributions of social composition and history. The 
complexion of terrain shifts easily and often dramatically as one moves in any line 
outward from a given context. What characterizes the specificity of any district, territory 
also shifts in a series of continuous rearrangements of elements that are often intensely 
personal and specific to a history of accommodations and negotiations, increasingly 
supplemented and complicated by infusions of new residents and operators, many 
of which end up being temporary inhabitants. The varying arrangements operative 
within specific districts manifest an intricate architecture of vulnerabilities and 
opportunities at any given time, with certain opportunistic inclinations rendering the 
district more vulnerable to unanticipated events, while those seemingly more protected 
may experience undo consequences for their ability to weather certain storms further 
down the line. The tenuous hold on stabilities and territorial consolidation, requiring 
as it does participation in a wide range of external articulations in order to cushion 
the negative ramifications of over-  entanglement, is increasingly operationalized in 
steering inhabitants to more individualized orientations to livelihood formation, but it 
is also a declension of a willingness to stay put, or rather to piece together territories of 
operations through ‘strange alliances’ among places, actors and materials that seemingly 
would not necessarily go together.

BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURES AND URBAN SPACIOUSNESS (COMPASSION)980
Without guarantees: the time of the maybe
Compassion has often been popularly construed as the certainty of care. Showing 
compassion does not depend on the recipient demonstrating their eligibility for it. While 
the recipient might be categorized as more or less worthy of compassion according 
to various standards, no matter what a person has done or faces, compassion can still 
be demonstrated as something that exceeds determinations of worthiness. Simply to 
be alive in this world, no matter how a person might live this life, is the grounds for 
compassion. We may despise what a person has done or even attribute to that person 
a certain measure of evil, yet there are always grounds on which compassion may be 
warranted. Certain doctrines may require confession or professions of faith on the part 
of the recipient, as well as requests for forgiveness or acts of contrition as the means to 
explicitly invite compassion to be demonstrated. Yet the human, in all of its frailty, in all 
of its final powerlessness in the face of death and in the face of an infinite cosmos, always 
struggles to make sense of their environs, and no matter the sense made, no matter the 
particular life curated, always fails in the midst of an uncertainty that consumes them.
Yet this certainty of the possibility of compassion, of compassion as the act that 
renders a degree of certainty to life in that love and kindness can be extended to any 
situation or act no matter how unforgivable, sets up a binary where compassion can 
be rejected. This rejection may entail recognizing compassion for what it is and then 
refusing it either in intensive feelings of self-  disgust, indifference or resistance to acting 
with compassion to the other’s performance of it. As reflected in the other contributions 
to this Interventions collection, this is why it is important to distinguish compassion 
from care.
For if compassion engenders spaciousness, in extending or dissipating the 
parameters of any act, unsettling a fixed connection between the person and the act or 
situation, then the refusal of compassion marks the collapse of space onto the primacy 
of a single signification. For compassion basically says, ‘Hey, wait a minute, despite all 
that is said and done, is there something else we are missing here; is there something at 
work, in either the person’s life or context that has led this individual down a particular 
route, that could have been different if only someone treated that person in a different 
way; if they had only taken them more or less seriously; if only they had gotten in the 
way of them doing evil?’
Here, the enactment of any life becomes a collective responsibility. Not in the 
sense that everyone bears a collective responsibility for everyone else, but rather in the 
sense that looking out for ourselves always means particular ways of looking out for 
others. Compassion accords spaciousness in terms of opening up the consideration of 
any life to a vast ensemble of meanings that decenter hardship or evil being precisely or 
singularly located within the territory of the self. The accordance of compassion is an 
accordance of spatiality, granting a surfeit of maneuverability that permits unanticipated 
courses of action, the provision of new witnesses and new collectives. As compassion is 
demonstrated for and to a particular person, the compassionate assumes a responsibility 
on behalf of the person to regard them as more than the evidence they embody, and in 
doing so accord that evidence an altered domain of consideration. The provision of this 
space is what the compassionate does to the victim, however persecuted, marginalized, 
deranged. But the mode of conveyance must also anticipate its prospect of refusal, a 
refusal that exceeds the specific encounter. So compassion may sometimes need not 
to be recognized as such, even as demonstrations of compassion are that which offers 
life its most spacious terrain. To disarm the refusal of compassion, it may be necessary 
that the potential recipient be compelled to take the risk of not knowing whether such 
compassion is present or not, that they co- produce that moment of compassion rather 
than just passively receive it.
Compassion is, as alluded to just now, a temporal matter as well: ‘wait a moment’.

take place, some other form of paying attention. This is a time of the ‘maybe’, where 
things could go many different ways, but despite the precision of calculated anticipation 
or the most careful planning, the prospects for making a specific disposition happen are 
no greater than a complete lack of preparation. Will one make it through a roadblock or 
checkpoint unimpeded; will one make it home safely during a tremendous storm? Maybe 
yes, maybe no. In such a temporal frame, it is impossible to weigh the variables, to assign 
a statistical probability one way or another.
Such temporality reflects the conjunction between inhabitant and environment 
where things could go many different ways:
It is a notion that resonates with Deleuze’s figuration of a ‘center of 
determinacy’ (1991) but which does not line up completely, as the maybe 
reflects the ellipsis in all performance. All of the traumas of the past, everything 
that has been tried so far, whether it works or not, all of the times where one 
has fallen down to pick oneself up again does not prepare a person for what 
will take place now. All of that suffering that won’t be redeemed, but which 
has thickened your skin, turned the surface of the body into a confusing map 
of contradictory itineraries. All this both comes to matter and won’t matter on 
whether the person passes through the roadblock, manages to mobilize a life’s 
savings into something tangible, manages to turn that corner just before the 
police or debt collectors arrive … This time of the maybe, more than simply a 
wager or speculation, is a continuous refusal against what is on offer, against 
how one is regarded. It is a situation where no matter what a person has doesn’t 
count, and where all that the person doesn’t have is also refused count. Given 
all of the ways larger numbers of inhabitants in our cities are on the move, often 
relinquishing things of value in order to better position themselves in relation to 
often opaque opportunities, as well as the stories they tell both themselves and 
others about how they assess and decide, this politics of the maybe becomes 
increasingly salient to intensified circulations of bodies and things (Akoth 
et al., 2024: 4).
It also becomes a concretization of compassion in that nothing counts for sure, that 
even the least deserving, prepared or eligible have a chance, as do those now seemingly 
thoroughly dispossessed of their hard work and integrity. While this does not sound 
fair nor just, an even unwelcome equilibration of significant differences for being in 
the world, such positionality shows compassion by turning every performance, every 
context into something more than what it is, even if only an impenetrable and cruel 
arbitrariness.
