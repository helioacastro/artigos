Ecological livelihoods ABSTRACT  
In the face of diverse socio-ecological crises, regenerative agriculture promises to enliven rural landscapes by 
positioning farmers as key actors in mitigating the ‘carbon problem ’ on the one hand, and adapting to it on the 
other. This article troubles ways of knowing regenerative agriculture through soil-and-carbon centered repre -
sentational knowledge practices. Conceptually, we build on relational scholarship and use the concept of (un) 
knowing landscapes to suggest that agricultural landscapes both become, and become (un)known in and through 
diverse more-than-human relations. Empirically, we draw from ethnographic fieldwork independently conducted 
at farms in Finland, Norway and Italy practicing diversified regenerative agriculture. By focusing specifically on 
the practices of composting and processes of decomposition, we show how farmers come to know and reciprocate 
the aliveness of their landscapes through both proximate and distant relational dynamics: balancing between 
control and cohabitation, caring for and taking care of, and attending to multiple rhythms of (re)production. We 
argue that placing a deeper focus on soils — even when representing them differently — not only risks making 
proximate relations in diversified regenerative agricultural landscapes unknown , but also permits these land-
scapes to become known primarily through relations of distance. This, in turn, enables the commensurability of 
regenerative agricultural landscapes into tradable units for carbon markets. We conclude that transformation 
towards ecological livelihoods requires a radical reevaluation of, and accounting for, diverse more-than-human 
landscape relations.   
1.Entry point 
Finland, November 2021 : “Oh, look at that lovely landscape of fields ”, 
exclaimed my mother-in-law as we were driving through a typical 
Finnish landscape, where [mildly sloped] agricultural fields extend for 
tens of hectares eventually stopping at woodland fences that we call 
forests. It was late fall and all of the crops had been harvested. As I gazed 
out from the driver ’s seat at the brown, bare landscape seeping into my 
consciousness, I privately returned to Ulrika ’s farm, standing barefoot in 
the middle of a transpiring forest garden that used to be a plain field. 
What I saw from the window went against everything that I had learned 
during the past two years — through walking barefoot, smelling flowers, 
touching soils, plants and animals, and listening to heartwarming and heartbreaking stories in diverse landscapes — making it appear anything 
but lovely. I began to imagine the extensive clear cuts and sustained, 
recurrent monocropping and use of chemicals that must have been un-
dertaken to produce this desertified landscape. I could hear tractors 
driving back and forth, plowing the soil and turning it into dirt.1 I could 
smell gasoline and dust. I sensed the wind beginning to spiral the dry 
dirt, and envisioned how rain packed into muddy pools, how sunlight 
dried the surface of the fields into stone hard chunks, forming ‘pictur -
esque ’ geometrical shapes. I saw excel-sheets confirming tons of harvest. 
Looking at the landscape passing by, I sensed survival, not life. (Kallio, 
field diary).

2recently been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The steep 
hill opened out into an expansive view of the valley. A river ran through 
the bottom, towns collected along it, small villages dotted the tops of the 
cascading hills above, and forested hilltops extended into the horizon. 
Andre, who had driven us this way specifically for the view, said with a 
sigh “I don’t understand why they give such a designation to a place 
filled with monocultures ”. Funny. I’m being taken to see this historic 
wine-making valley while Andre scoffs at its UNESCO designation 
because it’s filled with wine-grape monocultures. Most people would be 
in perfect admiration of this idyllic Italian countryside view, as I had 
been. Although the area was historically a wine making region, Andre 
told me, the visual presence of grape monocultures had significantly 
increased along with the global reputation of the region ’s wine. Small 
and diversified family farms had sold their land to large wine-making 
operations who grew only grape monocultures, slowly re-shaping the 
makeup of the countryside, ecologically, visually and more. By the time 
we finally arrived at the farm, I felt I could never really enjoy the 
monocultural countryside again. (LaFleur, field diary). 
The vignettes above reveal moments of interruption and change in 
our ways of knowing in and of rural landscapes. They suggest that close, 
sensuous attention to more-than-human relations can reveal how agri-
cultural landscapes are made, shaped and inhabited (Barua, 2014 ; Heley 
and Jones, 2012 ; Ingold, 2013 ; Tsing, 2005 ) — and ultimately become 
known. 
In this article, we draw on theoretical discussions of ‘landscape ’ and 
our ethnographic work to evoke a concept of ‘(un)knowing landscapes ’2 
that goes beyond the dominant scientific and art-historical visual rep-
resentation of landscape (Ingold, 2012 ; Olwig, 2008 ). This notion is 
made possible by thinking of knowledge not as an object, but as being 
composed of the ways of knowing that constitute processual knowledge 
that is always socioecological, economic, political and grounded in 
sensuous, practical and ongoing activity with/in landscapes (Harris, 
2007 ; Lounela et al., 2019 ; Vergunst et al., 2012 ). Bringing this work 
into conversation with our ethnographies, we aim to show how land-
scapes both become and become (un)known, in and through diverse 
more-than-human relations. This suggests that ‘knowing ’ is not merely a 
matter of producing representational knowledge of or about the con-
stituents of agricultural landscapes as isolated interacting objects (e.g. 
soils, microbes, plants, compost, insects, infrastructures, etc.), but that 
agricultural landscapes, including their “weather-world ” (Ingold 2011 : 
132), become known through multiplicities of ongoing relations, and 
correspondences that sustain or erode these relations. Through empir -
ical examination of the more-than-human relations that comprise the 
myriad ways of knowing in regenerative agriculture, we bring forth a 
relational understanding of agricultural landscapes as alive, transpiring 
through meshworks of lively and deadly relations that exceed their 
representational characterizations. From this approach, agricultural 
landscapes can be recognised as being at once socioecological, economic, and political sites for the making of “ecological livelihoods ”3 
(Miller and Gibson-Graham, 2020 ). In positing this, we situate the 
concept of ‘(un)knowing landscapes ’ alongside a growing number of 
scholars who have sought to trouble representational ways of knowing 
landscapes that prevail in entangled spheres of science, policy and in-
dustry (Baptista, 2018 ; Carolan, 2008 ; Plessis, 2022 ; Ingold, 2000 , 2011 ; 
Lyons, 2020 ; Marsden and Sonnino, 2008 ; Tsing, 2015 ; Kimmerer, 
2013 ). 
The article foregrounds a conception of knowledge not as something 
that is ‘objective ’, ‘complete ’ or can be ‘possessed ’, but as composed of 
ways of knowing that evolve in and through time, and manifest in ways of 
moving, sensing, doing, and practicing in the making of relations 
(Darnhofer et al., 2019 ; Grasseni, 2010 ; Harris, 2007 ; Maslen, 2015 ). 
Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in diverse landscapes of 
regenerative agriculture in Finland, Norway and Italy4 and on sensory 
and practice-based analysis (Gherardi, 2012 ; MacIntyre, 2007 ,; Pink, 
2015 ; Rasanen, 2009 ), we identify three kinds of dynamics that 
permeate more-than-human relations: i) balancing between control and 
cohabitation, ii) caring for and taking care of, and iii) attending to 
rhythms of (re)production. Through describing these intricate dynamics, 
the article joins a number of scholars in challenging the dominance of 
distant, decontextualized, and hi-tech mediated representational 
knowledge practices that inform policy, analysis and decision-making 
structures in rural areas (Marsden and Sonnino, 2008 ; Siebert et al., 
2008 ; Tsing, 2005 ), and that help maintain and reproduce power re-
lations through “representational relations of distance ” (Baptista, 2018 : 
401). We contribute empirical findings and insist, in line with Ingold 
(2011) Baptista (2018) , Barua (2014) , Kimmerer (2013) , Miller and 
Gibson-Graham (2020) and Tsing (2005 , 2015) , that such forms of 
representational knowledge of agricultural landscapes tend to disclose a 
world of static interacting objects that can — or must — be manipulated 
from the ‘outside ’ of agricultural landscapes (i.e. at a distance), while 
simultaneously being unable to account for the diverse 
more-than-human relations that ongoingly unfold in their making.5 It is 
critical, we argue, to account for the proximate, more-than-human 
relationalities and diverse ways of knowing in agricultural landscapes 
precisely because such relations are how landscapes ultimately transpire , 
and sustain rural ecological livelihoods. 
We conclude with two main points. First, we argue that landscape 
relations are not reducible to soil-relations or representations of soil 
health/aliveness. Doing so in the context of the ‘carbon problem ’ risks 
devaluing proximate relations of regeneration, and becoming unknown 
in ways that cede control of landscapes to technoscientific-backed 
corporate interests. Second, we argue that a relational approach to 
research and analysis is ideal for disclosing economic and political in-
cursions that might otherwise be invisible. This is because a relational 
approach can better account for the complexity of more-than-human 
2 The notion of ’(un)knowing landscapes ’ refers in part to a phenomenon 
understood by Indigenous peoples and peasant communities through antiquity, 
sometimes referred to by Western scholars as ‘animist ’, ‘spiritual ’ or ‘religious ’. 
Our specific use of the term is a synthesis of our ethnographic work with 
farmers, and Anderson ’s (2000) notion of ‘sentient ecology ’, which refers to 
ways of knowing “based in feeling, consisting in the skills, sensitivities and 
orientations that have developed through long experience of conducting one’s 
life in a particular environment ” (Ingold, 2000 : 25, citing Anderson). We add 
the “(un)- ” as a way to denote how representations of landscapes contribute to 
knowing them less through proximate, sensuous relations, and more through 
universalizing knowledge practices and technologies. See also the work of e.g. 
Cruikshank, 2005; Ingold and Simonetti (2022) ; Kimmerer (2013) ; LeVasseur 
et al., (2016) ; Tsing (2005) , 2015 . 3 Miller and Gibson-Graham describe ecological livelihoods as indicating “a 
diversity of activity, a variety of skills and knowledges, a plethora of possible 
sites of action, and multiple configurations of ever-changing relations and 
processes that cannot be captured by a generality ” (2020: 321).

different farms since 2019; Will conducted ethnographic fieldwork in Italy in 
2018 (3 months), and Finland in 2021 (4 months), including multiple follow-up 
visits.  
5 While we appreciate that scientific and policy experts that deal in relations 
of distance would surely acknowledge that the aliveness of more-than-human 
relational ecologies (e.g. landscapes, soils, insects, forests, etc.) are important 
aspects of understanding the polycrises we face, our critique is aimed rather at 
the objects of knowledge that such actors produce through modeling, mapping 
or quantification, and which necessarily cut out more-than-human relation -
alities in the process of their representation. As elite forms of power make 
decisions and take action according to such representational objects of 
knowledge, the fact that more-than-human relationalities are missing from 
them is highly consequential. G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

scapes and beyond (Heley and Jones, 2012; West et al., 2020). 
2.Background: the promise of regenerative agriculture 
Agriculture has been identified as a significant source of global 
warming and biodiversity loss (IPBES, 2019; IPCC, 2019). In the past 
few years the concept of regenerative agriculture, introduced by the 
6Rodale Institute (2020) in the 1980s, has emerged as a prominent so-
lution in mitigating climate change on the one hand, and adapting to it 
on the other (EASAC, 2022; EMAF, 2019; Rhodes, 2012, 2017). Rodale 
and similar organizations that advocate for regenerative agriculture 
emphasize a range of potential benefits: improved soil health, biodi -
versity and ecosystem resilience, lowered energy use, better nutrient 
cycling, reductions in pesticide and fertilizer applications, and carbon 
sequestration potential. From these ecological benefits would flow 
others, such as increased yield productivity, keeping more money in 
farmer’s hands, and creating more jobs, thereby enlivening rural areas 
and positioning farmers as key actors in remedying the most urgent 
global ills (WEF, 2020; RAA, 2022). According to a recent report, 
transnational agrifood companies have also become prominent advo-
cates, and the biggest investors, in regenerative agriculture (IDS and 
IPES-Food, 2022). These actors (e.g. General Mills, Coca-cola, Nestle, 
Unilever, Arla Foods) also emphasize ecological benefits, but notably, 
their interpretation of socio-ecological benefits tends to position farmers 
merely as carbon offsetting agents. 
Alongside these industry actors, scientists, policy-makers and non- 
governmental funders increasingly tout the potential of soils to act as 
carbon sinks (IDS and IPES-Food, 2022; Schreefel et al., 2020), singling 
out soils — which only partially constitute agricultural landscapes — as 
sites of experimentation for the application of technoscientific knowl -
edge (Gordon et al., 2021; Kearnes and Rickards, 2020).7 The knowledge 
produced about regenerative agricultural soils has, since the 1980’s, 
occurred primarily through Rodale Institute’s farming system trials (IDS 
and IPES-Food, 2022). Fueled by interest and speculation in industrial 
and policy spheres however, this knowledge has rather recently taken on 
new forms. It has come to be represented not through long-term 
experimental trials but predominantly through laboratory tests of soil 
samples, satellite images, microscopic observations, carbon measure -
ments, modeling exercises and balance sheets. 
These ways of knowing agricultural landscapes — which ultimately 
rely on vision for their apprehension (e.g. looking at maps, analyzing 
numbers and graphs of quantified things, peering through microscopes) 
— contrast sharply with the ways agricultural and other rural landscapes 
have historically become, and still are known i.e. by those who inhabit 
them. That is, through locally situated and multisensory practices: slash 
and burn, foraging of foods and medicines, plowing, sowing, and har-
vesting crops, hunting and fishing, practices of agroforestry, pastoralism 
and grazing animals, or even walking, hiking or other forms of recrea -
tion (Grasseni 2007; Ingold, 2004; Lee, 2007; Siebert et al., 2008; Suzman, 2020). In fact, only in the last two centuries have agricultural 
practices come to be defined by representational relationalities that 
proceed via globalized technoscience, focused in particular on soils and 
their market-oriented productive capacities (Baranski, 2022; Marchesi, 
2020; Stone, 2022). This phenomenon has helped to reduce relations of 
regeneration to various representations of knowledge about the sup-
posed discrete objects and subjects of landscapes (e.g. soils), and how 
they can better be made productive through, for example, synthetic 
fertilization, crop yields, nutrients, microbes or non-human labor 
(Lyons, 2020).8 
As the role of science-based ecological knowledge in transforming 
agricultural landscapes and their soils has become a critical concern in 
the midst of multiple ecological crises (IPCC, 2019; IPBES, 2019), there 
is a tendency to pursue ‘more’ and ‘better’ knowledge in the search for 
ecologically viable solutions (Stengers, 2016) — regenerative agricul -
ture being one key example. Yet pursuing ‘more’ and ‘better’ knowledge 
in particular ways (e.g. modeling carbon cycles, measuring productivity) 
shouldn’t automatically mean that such knowledges are universally 
‘appropriate’ or ‘good’. This is because the sorts of representational 
knowledges pursued by powerful actors are vulnerable to manipulation 
or control from a distance (Baptista, 2018; Tsing, 2005), and in turn run 
the risk of marginalizing the situated, sensuous and mor-
e-than-representational9 ways of knowing that unfold in the making of 
agricultural landscapes. This marginalization extends, of course, 
particularly to those who derive their livelihoods from these ways of 
knowing: small farmers and peasants, Indigenous peoples, and other 
groups with limited power relative to transnational corporations. 
Considering that (a particular notion of) regenerative agriculture is 
said to be an important key to the ‘carbon problem’, both the ways of 
knowing that are enacted and types of knowledges that are produced in 
pursuit of it warrant critical examination. There are some important 
considerations here. In practice, as we will show, those who practice 
what they termed ‘regenerative agriculture’ comprise far more diversity 
than the mainstream notion has come to stand for. Next, as a funda -
mental gaseous element that suffuses the atmosphere and earth, and all 
life in these domains, carbon requires ‘capturing’ in order to be 
accounted for — that is, it must be turned into a discrete, measurable 
object. While such a practice is relatively straightforward in terms of 
atmospheric measurement, measuring soil carbon presents certain 
problems. While it is well-known that soils can contain large amounts of 
carbon, it is a rather inconvenient (and yet under-discussed) fact that 
soil carbon is extremely volatile, especially in agricultural soils, and 
therefore appears increasingly impossible to consistently or accurately 
measure — even within the same field that is growing the same crop 
(Kallio and Houtbeckers, 2023; Powlson et al., 2011; Stanley et al., 
2023; Vekuri et al., 2023). Yet despite this fact, the push for regenerative 
agriculture — and the prospective carbon markets it could open — 
continues, led by some of the world’s biggest polluters and bolstered by 
recent legislative policy interventions in the U.S. and E.U.10 encouraging 
carbon trading for regenerative agriculture (IDS and IPES-Food, 2022; 
Kearnes and Rickards, 2020; Shiva 2022). 
As this state of affairs is currently unfolding, and because these 
6 Although the explicit concept of regenerative agriculture was launched by 
the Rodale Institute, many of the principles and practices of regeneration are 
not new per se, but have been practiced by Indigenous people and peasants 
around the world for millennia (Carlisle, 2022). Moreover, the ecological 
knowledges and ways of knowing entailed in Indigenous or peasant notions of 
regeneration differ, often significantly, from modernist and technoscientific 
ones (see, e.g., Dahlberg, 1994; King, 2004 [1911]; Suzman, 2020; Yunkaporta, 
2019).  
7 As the potentialities and importance of soil is a key foci for (but not only) 
regenerative agriculture, our usage of soil and landscape can at times appear to 
be interchangeable in this text. However, we stress that while soils are indeed a 
major constituent of landscapes when thinking of them in relation to regener -
ative agriculture, our point is rather that in regenerative agriculture discourses, 
soils tend become objects isolated from landscapes, instead of one thread in the 
meshwork of which landscapes are composed. 8Baptista (2018: 406) shows that in the (neo)colonial production of knowl -
edge, attending to and privileging knowledge about something — the referential 
instead of the actual referent — becomes inherently superior to the proximate 
and sensuous direct knowledge that comes from lived experience. 
9We prefer the term “more-than-representational” instead of “non-repre -
sentational” for the same reasons as Carolan (2008), Hayes-Conroy and 
Hayes-Conroy (2010) and Lorimer (2005).  
10 The U.S. signed the Growing Climate Solutions Act in law in 2021, while the 
E.U. is currently considering the Carbon Removal Certification Framework. 
Furthermore, the Executive Secretariat of the international “4 per 1000” 
Initiative was launched in 2015 during COP 21. While not exactly the same, 
these interventions have, or aim to, open agriculture to carbon trading schemes. G. Kallio and W.

4market dynamics began to become visible in our ethnographic work, 
there arose a need to take a closer look at landscape relations, and how 
they transpire at farms practicing regenerative agriculture in diverse 
ways. Next, we outline the literatures that have informed our critical 
approach to regenerative agricultural landscapes. 
3.Conceptualizing relational approaches to agricultural 
landscapes 
3.1. Landscapes as objects 
Landscapes in modernity (and coloniality) are typically represented 
as objects of thought and visual perception ‘out there’: painterly scenes 
and cartographic prospectus that can be viewed, admired or imagined, 
but are disconnected from the activity of everyday life (Ingold, 2022; 
Ranciere, 2022; Saito, 2017). Yet, knowing landscapes this way is the 
result of the development of a particular type of relation with them. 
Specifically, this relation is predicated on the emergence of ‘landscape’ 
as a “specific object of thought” which embedded, in modern Western 
thought, “the experience of a form of unity in sensible diversity capable 
of changing the configuration of modes of perception and objects of 
thought that had existed until then” (Ranciere, 2022: x). Prior to this, the 
word landscape referred to a more-than-representational relationality, 
indicated by the terms’ Old English etymological origins, in which 
landscape literally meant “a land shaped” (Ingold, 2012: 198) through 
one’s dwelling, or “doing” (Olwig, 2008). 
Nonetheless, the representational importance of landscapes that 
prevails across academic disciplines, industry, governance, and 
everyday life, is indebted to this legacy of 17th and 18th century elite 
male, European thought. This legacy projects landscapes as the static 
host for subjects and objects that might be controlled, manipulated and 
extracted based on their perceived socio-economic value — an effect of 
locating value in the (static) properties of an object rather than the ac-
tions/relations that give rise to them (Graeber, 2001). Soils, as implied 
objects of landscapes, are increasingly caught up in just such a 
conceptualization as they become key objects of both concern and op-
portunity for scientists, policy makers and investors. In these spheres, 
knowledge about soils — cut out from the wider landscapes relations 
that give rise to them — are reduced to essentialized, often visual, vir-
tual or numerical forms, becoming the static representational founda -
tions on which consequential political and economic decisions are made. 
Ingold (2012) describes this process succinctly: 
“[In] the optical ‘scapes’ generated by the scopic regimes of 
modernity … light, sound and feeling are reduced to vectors for the 
projection of final forms, cut out from the processes that give rise to 
them. These scapes can be viewed, studied, analyzed, interpreted. 
But they cannot be inhabited.” (207) 
The fact that representations cannot be ‘inhabited’ is critical. As 
Ingold shows elsewhere, the kind of aliveness implied in Western 
biology rests on the assumption — through the doctrine of genetic 
preformation — that every organisms has a prespecified nature “prior to 
its entry into the life process”. This assumption necessarily leads to an 
understanding of life “as the reaction of organisms, bound by their 
separate natures, to the given conditions of their environment” (2000: 
61–62, emphasis original). This is the key to understanding why modern 
science can recognize the aliveness of landscapes while at the same time 
reify them as mere representations to be occupied, manipulated, and 
extracted from. The projection of final forms (e.g. an agricultural land-
scape) simultaneously depoliticizes the making of landscapes (and thus 
aesthetic and scientific knowledge produced about them) as they are 
rendered universal, commensurable objects of thought that can be 
neatly represented. Thus, turning landscapes into objects obscures the 
historical, socio-ecological, economic, and political relationalities 
through which they ongoingly emerge. 
To reject the idea of reducing complex relationalities into static objects is to reject the dominant knowledge practices of modernity/ 
coloniality itself (Baptista 2018; Ingold 2000, 2011; Kimmerer, 2013). It 
requires nothing less than collapsing the world of subjects and objects, 
allowing them to disperse into ‘fluid space’ (Ingold 2011; see also Mol 
and Law, 1994). Yet if we reject the idea that landscapes and their 
co-constituents are made up of discrete objects (or subjects), how should 
agricultural landscapes be understood differently? 
3.2. Landscapes as relations 
As several scholars have shown, landscapes come into being through 
more-than-human relations (e.g. pastoralists with their herds, farmers 
with their plows), and diverse movement and activity such as digging, 
damming or building with the landscapes’ materials, and in accordance 
with the landscapes’ weather and terrain (Baptista 2018; Barua, 2014; 
Ingold, 2000, 2011; Lyons, 2020; Kimmerer 2013; Tsing, 2005, 2015; 
Suzman, 2020). But equally, and especially in the modern era, rural 
landscapes have been shaped through processes external to them 
(Baptista, 2018; Tsing, 2005), as a result of policy making and city 
planning, ‘capitalocentric’ market orders (Gibson-Graham, 2006) or 
unevenly distributed land ownership (Shiva, 2016; Suzman, 2020). 
Moving towards an understanding of landscapes as unfolding materi -
alizations of more-than-human relations then, as Tsing puts it, is a means 
to exploring how “[l]andscapes are simultaneously natural and social, 
and [they] shift and turn in the interplay of human and nonhuman 
practices.” (Tsing 2005, 29). 
One of the central features of a relational approach to landscapes is, 
as indicated above, the acknowledgement of their aliveness: that land-
scapes and the materials and species that inhabit them are ongoingly 
living and dying, birthing and decaying, exploiting and reciprocating 
(Ingold 2000; Kimmerer 2013; Lyons 2020; Tsing 2015). This aliveness 
becomes known to humans through various relational forms, for 
example, with glaciers (Cruikshank, 2005) or with soils, where the 
recognition of aliveness has emphasized human-soil relationalities. Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2012, 2015) has pointed out that seeing soils as an inert 
or passive object that can be manipulated for technoscientific futures has 
led to exploitative ways of knowing and treating soils. In arguing for 
“reanimating soils” she has sought to make visible “soil-as-living, a 
relational entity of which humans are part” (ibid. 2014, 1, emphasis 
original). Krzywoszynska (Krzywoszynska, 2016, 2019; Krzywoszynska 
and Marchesi, 2020) has argued that more attention to place-based 
knowledge might cultivate a more sustainable approach to soils. Both 
Puig de la Bellacasa and Krzywoszynska foreground care as a central 
concern in their work on soils, suggesting that the making of ethical, 
caring relationships depends on embodied and emplaced11 relations 
with soil (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020; Pink, 2011, 2015; Puig de 
la Bellacasa, 2012) and seeing such experience as a way of becoming 
attuned to the temporal rhythms of more-than-human worlds (Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2014). While we broadly agree with both authors and follow 
their leads, instead of reducing landscape relations to soils per se, we 
find it rather important to bring forth an understanding of soils that is 
not separate from landscapes, but are part of landscapes. 
Empirical ethnographic research has also been critical in showing 
and recognizing the aliveness of landscapes. Several authors have traced 
how local ways of knowing landscapes are entangled with global power 
structures — colonial, scientific, capitalist — that are ’external’ to them. 
For instance, more-than-human relationalities have been examined in 
the matsutake mushroom trade (Tsing, 2015), the struggles of Indone -
sian forest communities in the face of development policies (Tsing, 
2005), amongst animals, hunters and pastoralists (Ingold, 1994), with 
plant ecologies (Kimmerer, 2013), human-elephant relations in 
11 The concept of emplacement as developed by Pink (2011, 2015) brings a 
sense of place to the notion of embodiment such that embodiment is always 
inflected with the socio-ecological, economic and political. G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

5post-colonial India (Barua, 2014 ) and metabolic relationalities of 
earthworms, soils and scientists (Bertoni, 2013 ). Baptista (2018) has 
most explicitly addressed the issue that universalizing, colonial knowl -
edge works through relations of distance, while local knowledges are 
necessarily formed through relations of proximity. What all of these 
authors have in common is a commitment to landscapes as the ongoing 
“dwelt achievements ” (Barua, 2014 : 916) of people, animals, plants, 
materials, and weather. In approaching landscapes in this way, they 
have excelled in showing the entangled relationalities of how various 
groups procure their livelihoods amidst the ongoingness of life, while 
simultaneously attending to the global structures that set the trajectories 
and possibilities for doing so. 
A particularly important aspect of approaching landscapes this way 
is through Kimmerer ’s (2013) notion of reciprocity. Kimmerer depicts 
landscape relations through the storying of plant relations. In these ac-
counts, Kimmerer illustrates the notion of ‘knowing landscapes ’ by 
invoking the concept of reciprocity as a form of relating. She shows this 
through the practice of gifting, for example, with wild strawberries. 
Through close attention to the plant ’s behavior it appears, as she ex-
plains, as though the plant is offering up a gift, to which the only reply is 
to eat them: “No person taught us this — the strawberries showed us. 
Because they had given us a gift, an ongoing relationship opened be-
tween us” (Kimmerer, 2013 : 25). 
Combining the insights from the authors above with our own 
ethnographic work, we aim to show that the complexity and significance 
of relations that also sustain regenerative farms is reduced through the 
imposition of relations of distance, and that when it comes to relations of 
proximity — that is, everyday experiential, sensuous encounters with/in 
landscapes — the simplistic relationalities that are afforded by distance 
become far more complex. By tracing relations in agricultural land-
scapes, we wish to focus attention to the ways that landscapes materi -
alize, and become known from the ‘inside ’ of everyday practices with 
more-than-human others (Ingold 2017 , 2021 ; c. f. Grasseni, 2010 ), as 
well as how social, economic and political ‘outsides ’ are inflected 
through the power of representational practices (Baptista, 2018 ). As 
well as adding further empirical weight to the literature discussed 
above, the relational approach developed here also contributes to the 
development and articulation of the so-called “relational turn” (e.g. 
West et al., 2020 ) in humanities, social and sustainability sciences 
broadly, including rural studies (Darnhofer et al., 2016 ; Heley and 
Jones, 2012 ; Lee, 2007 ), and more-than-representational theor -
y-methodologies (Anderson and Harrison, 2012 ; Thrift, 2008 ; Vannini, 
2020 ) concerned with critically reassessing the ways of knowing 
implicated in the production of academic knowledge. 
4.Situating fieldwork: context, method and analysis 
We have explored a heterogeneous mix of agricultural practices that 
comprise what has been termed “regenerative agriculture ” (Newton 
et al., 2020 ; Schreefel et al., 2020 ). In our cases, regenerative agriculture 
appears as a far more diverse field than its mainstream notion has come 
to stand for. However, we preclude from our definition of regenerative 
agriculture conventional farms that are transitioning to or borrowing a 
selection of ‘regenerative ’ practices (c.f. Giller et al., 2021 ; Leitheiser 
et al., 2022 ). We refer rather to farms in which we have conducted 
fieldwork: those which have previously undergone transformation into 
applying primarily regenerative practices, as well as those which began 
in the first place from such practices. These included farming strategies 
variously labeled as diversified organic, biodynamic, agroecological, 
permaculture, market gardening, agroforestry and forest gardening, as 
well as farms acting as experimentation sites for carbon farming (see e.g. 
Carbon Action Network, 2022 ). 
Landscape configurations were reflected through the practices that 
the farmers undertook on the farms: composting, plowing, cultivating 
under or cover-crops, reducing or eliminating tillage, maintaining 
grazing animals, building permanent and temporary structures for human, animal or plant shelters, using and maintaining heavy and light 
farm equipment, and even labor coordination. Ostensibly, a farmer 
might seek out and learn (about) regenerative agriculture through 
YouTube videos, Instagram, books, from an online course (e.g. Elaine 
Ingham ’s Soil Food Web courses) or in-person course (e.g. Richard 
Perkins ’ 4-day Market Gardening) and selectively apply the learnings in 
their farming practice. But as we learned, farmers ’ practices ranged 
widely as they were picking and choosing from various farming alter-
natives, thus largely resisting homogeneity in their work on regenera -
tion. This heterogeneity is precisely what we wish to emphasize, as it 
stands out from the more homogenous conception promoted by corpo -
rate actors (IDS and IPES-Food, 2022 ). 
We situate our approach within a practice-based onto-epistemology 
(Gherardi, 2012 ) that attends to sensuous relations in 
more-than-representational ways (Caffyn, 2021 ; Ingold, 2000: 243-287; 
Howes, 1991 , 2005 ; Pink, 2015 ). This inductive approach means that 
our conceptualizations have derived from the ethnographic fieldwork 
we have undertaken, independently, at regenerative farms in Finland, 
Norway, and Italy. Since 2019, Galina has been a participant-observer in 
15 different farms practicing regenerative agriculture in Southern and 
Eastern Finland and in one regenerative farm in Norway located some 
100 km from Oslo. These have included periodic visits, field trips lasting 
for several days, as well as single-day observation trips. Will has un-
dertaken participant observation at two regenerative farms in Italy and 
Finland in 2018 and 2021 over continuous three and four month pe-
riods, respectively, and including multiple short-term follow up visits. In 
addition, one farm in Finland served as a field site for both authors, 
albeit at different times. Both researchers participated in and observed 
everyday work at the farms throughout different seasons and conducted 
interviews with farmers and farm volunteer workers. 
In seeking to understand more-than-human relations we have 
focused on analyzing how they occur in everyday work practices 
(Gherardi, 2012 ) amidst the fluxes and flows of movement and growth 
in and with landscapes. Building on the framework of practical activity 
(FPA) (Rasanen, 2009 , Kallio and Houtbeckers, 2020 ), the first stage of 
the analysis included producing a ‘thick description ’ (Geertz, 1973 ) with 
a particular focus on identifying working practices at different farms 
(tactical/operational aspects); practitioners ’ aims and aspirations (po-
litical aspects); conceptions of “good ” farming (moral aspects); and roles 
of different subjects/actors (identity aspects) (Kallio, 2022). 
In the second stage we used dialogue as a method of bringing two 
ethnographies together (Kallio and Houtbeckers, 2020) in order to share 
the practices and stories from the fields. These discussions consisted of 
an analysis in which we (re)examined fieldwork material — notes, 
photos, videos, interview transcripts — and reflected explicitly on our 
own sensuous experiences through storytelling dialogs (Pink, 2015 ; 
Howes and Classen, 1991 ). These discussions provided insights into the 
‘ways of knowing ’ we observed of others and underwent ourselves, and 
the nature of the relations that unfolded from them. This process helped 
us to further become knowledgeable of the diversity of ‘regenerative 
landscapes ’, and provided insights about the deep convergences in 
practices, even when farming styles (biodynamic, permaculture, etc.) 
indicated differences. The sensuous analysis constituted, in itself, “a way 
of knowing engaged in by the researcher(s) during the research ” (Pink 
2015 : 143), helping us to “imagine and feel [our] way back into the 
research encounter ” (146). For example, the vignettes that opened this 
article arose from this process, and we produced them specifically 
because they show key moments in the acquisition of “skilled visions ”12 
(Grasseni 2010) (as well as other sensuous enskilment) that aided our 
12 Though focused on the sense of vision, Grasseni ’s concept emphasizes the 
fact that ways of sensing are never isolated from each other (i.e. always 
multisensory) and are not given apriori, but are “situated, contested, politically 
fraught ” and ongoingly made in “complex relation with the sociotechnical 
network ” (Grasseni, 2010 : 1–2). See also Ingold, 2000: 243-287. G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

6“arts of noticing” (Tsing, 2012) in attending to landscapes and living 
beings that inhabit them. Although we do not analyze our own processes 
of sensory enskilment per se, it is these instances of learning and expe-
rience that led us to engage in analyzing landscape relations in regen -
erative agriculture. 
We placed particular attention on human-soil relations, relationships 
between humans, animals and other living beings (fungi, insects, plants, 
etc.), and relations with and amongst farm workers. Through this iter-
ative process we identified certain dynamics that cut across the everyday 
work practices at farms, namely dynamics of ‘control’, ‘care’, and 
‘rhythms’. We made use of extensive material including visual (photos, 
video recordings), audio (recording of sounds), field notes and interview 
transcripts, together with social media data generated by the farmers 
themselves (Instagram, Facebook). This material was independently 
analyzed and served as the fodder for our storytelling dialogs, and hel-
ped crystallize our analytical categories focused on the relational dy-
namics of control, care and rhythms. 
We weave our stories here together into a ‘collage-tale’, which we 
term vignette. The vignette works to both specify both individual au-
thor’s experiences, while also showing the extensive overlaps in our 
fieldwork experiences despite working independently from one another 
and in different countries. At the same time, the vignette showcases the 
diversity of regenerative practices that exist beyond what the main -
stream term has come to refer to. In the narrative, we forgo the use of “I” 
and adopt third-person and plurals (Galina, Will, she, he, they, we) to 
indicate difference, repetition, and convergence in our experiences. 
Overall, the vignette is an attempt to evocatively bring the reader closer 
to the landscapes that changed us even as we participated in changing 
them. 
5.Regenerating landscapes: tales from the fields 
In the process of telling our stories it became clear that we shared a 
variety of resonant experiences. While all the farms that we visited 
identified themselves at least partly within the framework of regenera -
tive agriculture, their landscapes differed greatly from each other. Yet it 
was not the diversity of the agricultural landscapes which surprised us, 
but rather the range and complexity of relations through which the 
landscapes came into being. The ways we came to know and experience 
landscapes was decidedly not as visual objects for the gaze, but as lively, 
multisensory ecologies of movement, growth and contingency. The 
impossibility of representing all aspects of these experiences led us to 
compare our experiences, collate our tales from the fields and focus on 
producing one overarching vignette that could trace, specifically, the 
practices of composting and processes of decomposing. 
Compost, as we came to observe, held an essential role as a fertilizer 
of the soils at all but three farms that we visited. Composting practices, 
then, were critical for augmenting soil health — a ‘matter of care’ in 
regenerative agriculture (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019) that unfolded 
through relations that emerged in the making, procurement, processing 
and distribution of compost. These relations cut across the whole spec-
trum of everyday work at regenerative farms, deeply shaping the ways of 
sensing and knowing that farmers and workers experienced in their 
everyday practices (with) their regenerative landscapes. With this ’col-
lage-tale’ vignette, we aim to show the instances of sensory enskilment 
and ways of knowing that comprise the meshwork of more-than-human 
relations that composting practices entail, highlighting moments of 
insight, disruption and change in how we began to relate with regen -
erative work and agricultural landscapes. 
5.1. Composting and decomposing life and death 
Galina is only 15 minutes late but her sense of urgency is high. She 
promised to be at the farm at nine to feed the cows. Ahti, the farmer, 
calls and inquires about their arrival: “The cows are getting loud”, he 
says. Galina arrives, and hastens to the cow house through a snowy path. She takes a pile of hay and before she manages to find her way to the 
crib, the eastern Finncattle start ripping the hay out of her hands. “They 
produce valuable stuff”, Ahti asserts. At Ahti’s farm, typical of biody -
namic farms generally, the number of cows kept accorded with the 
number of cultivated hectares. This is done in order to form a closed 
loop: allocating sufficient pasture land and winter fodder for the cows, 
who, in their turn, generate enough manure for making compost for 
farming purposes. During winter, cows, oftentimes together with other 
animals such as chicken and sheep, live in the old stone and wood cow 
houses, ranging outdoors only a few times. In the summer the farmers 
manage the animals by rotating them through the different pastures, 
which the farmers periodically monitor. Galina stands in the chilly 
farmhouse and observes how warm air evaporates through the rhythmic 
‘crunch’ of the hungry cows, as Ahti breaks the ‘silence’: “unlike pro-
duction cows, these [cows] live long. The oldest was 23 when she died of 
old age. There’s a lot of work, but doing otherwise would be impossible”. 
It can indeed be a lot of work to make the compost. It’s mid-July and 
four volunteers work with Jesus at a northern Italian farm. Some wear 
cotton towels over their face to subdue the strong odor of manure that is 
getting pushed into a pile by a very old tractor. Will, together with other 
volunteers, rakes out the manure which cakes around their shoes and 
boots, making foot movement heavy and clumsy. Jesus tosses out bits of 
this and that onto the manure: grain husks, ground stone, straw, a sweet 
but funky smelling fermented liquid. They rake the muck out and make 
sure it’s evenly mixed into the cow dung. “Tomorrow it might rain and 
this compost must be created while it’s dry”, Jesus explains. At midnight 
they cover the long, dense mound with a sheet of plastic to protect it 
from the coming rain and to create ideal conditions for the start of the 
microbial work to begin — anaerobic fermentation. After five days, the 
plastic cover is removed and the long mound gets covered with dried 
straw clippings from the wheat field. Jesus encourages everyone to stick 
their hand into an opening he’s made. “Oooh! It’s burning hot!” yells 
Will. 
Not everyone, though, were sticking their hands periodically into 
compost to follow the process of decomposition. At another farm, back 
in Finland, we both observe how the anaerobic fermentation is 
constantly monitored by a long thermometer sticking out of the pile and 
the farmer making quick visual checks when passing by the compost pile 
to make sure the microbes are at the right temperature for doing their 
work. Will considers the absence of any theremometer in the compost at 
the Italian farm. 
Alongside cow manure farmers might also use animal manure from 
sheep, horses, pigs and chickens to make a compost. Jesus explains to 
Will that each animal’s manure has different properties, and can be used 
to address certain imbalances in soils. In addition to manure-based 
composts we come to observe how farmers fertilize the soils with 
plant-based compost made from weeds, grass clippings and rotten veg-
etables, putrid-smelling earthworm ‘vermicompost’, ‘green-manure’, 
and add chicken egg shells directly to soils and composts. 
At some farms we walk on wood chip paths that have been hauled by 
volunteers to line garden walkways, both guiding walkers and pre-
venting soil compression. While walking along them, fruiting mush -
rooms and white tufts of fungal mycelia can be glimpsed here and there, 
and blasts of earthy aroma might envelop you unexpectedly, especially 
after a good rain. “Decomposition is so fascinating, but an incredibly 
complex and understudied phenomenon”, states the permaculture 
farmer as they walk with Galina on wood chip paths to observe the 
compost pile. At this same farm, and contrary to what Galina had 
encountered before, Will observes later in the summer how vegetables 
that seemed perfectly fine end up in a compost: three large and perfectly 
edible zucchini he had harvested the day before; several kilos of garlic, 
apparently deemed unfit for sale, dumped onto the pile becoming a 
vegetative compost. After finding the large majority of this garlic to be in 
perfectly edible condition — but showing signs of a relatively short 
shelf-life — Will salvages nearly four kilos of it, taking it home to 
ferment in a salt brine for long-term storage. G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

7For many farmers, we learn, an essential aspect of their work is to 
follow the processes of decomposition closely. While walking through 
the fields, Iris was explaining to Galina how “cows process the grass 
which humans can’t and turn it into this black gold that we then use to 
grow food for the local community”. Galina and Iris stop at the compost 
pile, which, deposited with a tractor the previous autumn, lay in the 
middle of the fields extending some 20 meters in length and nearly 1 
meter high. Iris stuffs her hand deep inside it, pulling out a handful of 
dark soil-like matter right to her nose: “Ahh, just smell it”. Iris invites a 
group of school kids visiting and volunteering at the farm to gather 
around and start inhaling. It smells sweet, warm, and soil-like, and the 
farmer begins making remarks to describe its ‘sweetness’ and ‘earthi -
ness’. With the dark and moist composted manure in their hands they 
start laughing and joking how the situation reminds them vividly of 
wine tastings. 
Both of us find ourselves digging into the soils at several farms. Will 
is taken into a production field to dig a hole and pull out a chunk of earth 
to observe the processes of decomposition: are roots penetrating the 
annual layers of compost and finding their way into the soils below? 
Galina is directed to stick her hand in the soil at a farm in Norway and 
pick up a chunk of it: “Can you see these tiny white grains, that’s carbon 
that the roots have stored”, explains Nate, a soil expert visiting the farm. 
At yet another farm in Finland, Galina is transplanting celery into beds 
covered with compost. They sink smoothly into the soil. “Based on the 
soil analysis we shouldn’t be getting any harvest out of these fields”, 
exclaims the farmer, and continues: “but the harvest is of amazing 
quality, and more and more abundant each year — even with these 
extreme weather conditions for the last three years that we’ve experi -
enced! It truly shows that as this compost has been used here for decades 
now, the soils are in an amazing condition.” 
Following and participating in the yearly cycles of making composts 
allows us also to observe the birth of new animals in the spring. The turn 
of the winter can be deceitful, though. Galina enters the chicken house to 
change the water that was frozen during the night. Joonas, the farmer, 
guides her to check for eggs, as “chickens are very good at hiding them. 
But I don’t want to allow them to hatch quite yet as its still so cold for the 
newborns”. Birth also means that someone has to make space for the 
newcomers. Standing at Ahti’s farmyard together with other farm 
workers, Galina shivers when she hears the gunshot she knew to expect. 
A cow called Blacknose falls down immediately, making a red pond in 
the snow. She is reminded of another farmer, engaged in egg production, 
whose words echo in her head: “They have one great life and one bad 
day”. 
At yet another farm in southern Finland, where composts of various 
sorts are being made, volunteer worker Jordan says that for him the 
ideal would be to make vegan compost. This makes us think of what 
we’ve learned about a compost being, as several farmers often stated, a 
living organism: all those worms and insects that live in and literally 
make the compost by ‘shitting’ the vegetative material out in the form of 
compost. If made, how would one then end up defining a vegan 
compost? Borders are not so clear, yet borders are nonetheless being 
made by compost regulations. As Iris says, their compost can no longer 
be brought into the field to be put in contact with the soil. The regulation 
requires that a concrete platform be built, and that the compost be 
deposited onto the platform so that it is not in direct contact with the 
soil. Iris and her husband overcome this by applying for ‘a temporary 
transition permit’ for the compost, allowing them to deposit it into the 
field for ‘temporary storage’. “Contact with the soil is so important, and 
now with this new regulation they’re requiring us to put this living or-
ganism on a concrete barrier, separating it from the soil”, laments Iris. 
6.Becoming known: analysis of landscape relations in 
regenerative agriculture 
The practices of composting made visible not only the nature of 
landscape relations at farms that we worked at, but also the ways in which farm workers both came to know, and became knowledgeable of 
their landscapes. Working on and with the land required farmers, mar-
ket and forest gardeners and other soil workers to design their fields in 
ways that enabled them to produce food for themselves and for the 
surrounding (more-than-human) communities. In practice this meant 
that farmers were altering and shaping their landscapes — altering and 
shaping their landscape relations — in various ways: when preparing the 
soils for growth; when sowing seeds in soil-compost; nurturing the 
growth of seedlings and farm animals; when building fences, green -
houses, sheds, or biotope pastures. Following practices of making and 
using compost revealed interesting dynamics in how farmers lived in 
continuous negotiation about how to live in, use and regenerate the 
landscapes. 
Drawing from more-than-human relations emerging through prac-
tices of composting and the processes of decomposition shown in the 
vignette, we next move to an analysis of how different ways of knowing 
are (re)produced in and through regenerative farming practices. In what 
follows, we analyze how farmers and farm workers come to know their 
landscapes — soils, animals, plants, (other) living organisms and ma-
terials — through the dynamics of balancing between control and 
cohabitation, of caring for and taking care of, and of attending to mul-
tiple, entwined and conflicting rhythms of (re)production. While we 
describe these dynamics separately here for analytical purposes, it is 
critical to point out that they are of course indissolubly entangled in 
practice. As Krzywoszynska (2016: 295) notes, “[t]emporality emerges 
as an important element for understanding how to care [for plants]”, 
suggesting the interweaving of care and rhythmicity (see also Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2015). But equally, in everyday life care tends to converge 
with forms of trust and cohabiting, control and domination (Ingold, 
1994; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019). Below, we attempt to show how these 
dynamics are interwoven throughout the myriad practices undertaken 
with composting and decomposing. 
6.1. Balancing between control and cohabitation 
Transitioning to techno-industrial agriculture has been an attempt at 
taking agricultural landscapes and their constituent relations under 
exclusively human control (Shiva, 2016; Suzman, 2020; see also Tsing, 
2012). This is true to the extent that certain practices such as patenting 
seeds (Shiva, 2016) and regulations like subsidizing centralized mono -
cultural production (Kallio and Joona, 2021) have been undertaken in 
attempts to ensure controllable landscapes. Practices of composting and 
decomposing provide an insightful route to examining the complex and 
often ambiguous landscape relations that suffused regenerative prac-
tices: how farmers sought to foster cohabitation with their landscapes; 
how they were sometimes forced to yield control, or else sought to place 
aspects of their landscapes under control. 
Composting was one of the key sites of cohabitation.13 As we 
depicted in the vignette, a significant amount of human labor and or-
ganization went into making compost at the farm. This ranged from the 
preparation of compost from farm-based biomass, to living with and 
caring for diverse animals and regulating the number of manure- 
producing animals relative to field size. Such practices and processes, 
we suggest, are rooted in the openness of cohabitation, while simulta -
neously enrolled in forms of control that came from the inside of the 
13 Site of cohabitation refers both to compost as a living organism, a term 
commonly used by the farmers, as well as being analytical, derived from non- 
verbal experiences working in different farms and with farmers, as well as 
connecting with Ingold’s various discussions, following Heidegger’s ‘dwelling’, 
on the difference between ‘occupying’ and ‘inhabiting’ — or what he has lately 
come to term ‘Correspondence’ (Ingold 2021) — where the landscape is not

8regenerative practices themselves. 
For example, the size of a cow herd that would produce manure 
could be increased or reduced in accordance with dynamics of pasture 
size, pasture health (which relates also to the weather), the health or 
(unwanted) behavior of individual cattle, the number and labor capacity 
of able-bodied people to participate with pasturing, feeding, and other 
factors. Such decisions were undertaken through pragmatic, purposeful 
and sensuous everyday engagement within the relationalities of the 
particular farming landscapes in which they occurred. These landscape 
relations, moreover, were a fluid composition of attempts at controlling 
(e.g. when and where animals go to pasture, what and when animals eat 
during the winter time, how many can afford to live) that which is wont 
to cohabit: bringing animals into the pasture (re)enables a cohabitation 
that both maintains pasture biodiversity and reduces unwanted ‘pests ’, 
and enables the eventual production of manure that will be transformed 
into a microbially alive compost that ‘cohabits ’ with soils and seeds. 
Decisions arising from within the practical everyday activity of 
farming and sensuously proximate landscape relationalities inhered 
ways of knowing that were radically different from those that occurred 
at distance, imposed from the ‘outside ’ — through the employment of 
agricultural policies, hi-tech mediation devices and their representations 
in legal dictates — as a form of control (Baptista 2018 ). Decisions 
regarding life and death were an extreme example of this tension. At 
farms that we worked at, decisions to kill animals, or to allow them to 
reproduce — both primarily under human control — were founded in 
questions of livelihoods, health and wellbeing of humans, non-human 
animals and soils, value(s) (Kallio, 2020 ), and nutritional consider -
ations. At the same time, farmers needed to balance with the existing 
organic, biodynamic and food safety regulations, as well as with agri-
cultural subsidies, which imposed allowances and restrictions on the 
number of animals, and ways of caretaking, breeding, killing, and pro-
cessing them. Oftentimes these were at odds with the needs and 
know-how of the farmers. 
Indeed, it is instructive to examine legal regulations like the one that 
required the installation of a concrete slab on which to deposit manure. 
This particular regulation was written to prevent the placement of raw 
manure directly onto the ground, where it will eventually leach phos-
phorous and nitrogen. Not yet being decomposed enough for the soil to 
incorporate, the leaching of these nutrients runs-off into waterways and 
causes eutrophication. What the regulation does not accommodate, 
however, is the possibility to put composted manure directly onto the 
ground field. Allowing manure to decompose and transform into a state 
in which soils can readily incorporate the nutrients without fear of run- 
off required farmers to draw on their situated knowledge. Hence, for 
farmers with the time, space, and know-how, this regulation simply 
imposed a bureaucratic hurdle that sapped time and energy from their 
practice of farming, and potentially money if they had succumbed and 
had a concrete slab installed. 
It highlights an instance of attempting to control landscapes from the 
outside of the farming practice. That is, the concrete barrier was a legal- 
material intervention that required the farmer to act to control their 
landscape in accord with a particular way of world-making that was at 
odds with the farmers ’. The logic of the regulation falls in line with the 
world-making projects of modernity such as “hard-surfacing ”, in which 
the world is build to contain life and the cohabitation of organisms by 
blocking “the very intermingling of substances with the medium that is 
essential to life, growth and habitation ” (Ingold, 2011 :124). The con-
crete — a structure that might contain — was a material manifestation of 
a particular conception of how non-human relations should be 
patterned. It manifests a mode of control which, ironically, does in fact 
appear to recognize the aliveness of soils and landscapes, but in this 
recognition, assumes that life, death and cohabitation can be controlled 
and contained (Kallio, 2020). In navigating a way around the regulation, 
the farmer was able to avoid a landscape manifestation that would have 
prevented the lives of microbes, worms, insects, and other beings from 
entering into relations with the soiled landscape. While concrete was one way of attempting to control unruly life- 
forms — microbes, insects, fungi, non-human animals — from cohab -
iting, we found a similar but contrasting landscape intervention in the 
wood chips. Whereas wood chips also created a kind of barrier — to stop 
weed growth, to protect against soil compaction, to structure where 
people could and could not walk — their permeability was revealed in 
their allowance of fungal mycelia to decompose it, of birds to alter its 
intended boundary-making, and the particular aromas that it absorbed 
or else gave off when wet or harboring mycelia (concrete also has a 
‘smell ’ when wet, but one that is rather different than wood and fungal 
mycelia). Wood chips, perhaps due to their permeability, do not of 
course figure into the legal regulation (yet), but they are used by farmers 
as a way of managing or controlling how cohabitation unfolds. And 
crucially, they are a common intervention in regenerative agricultural 
landscapes like the ones we worked in, having arisen precisely from 
proximate ways of knowing landscapes. 
6.2. Caring for and taking care of 
We came to learn that care unfolded through complex, intimate re-
lations of ‘caring for’ and ‘taking care of’ myriad “matters of care” (Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2019 ). ‘Taking care of’ in our research contexts implied 
action referring to matters that need to be “dealt with ” or solved as part 
of the farming work. This was, however, an activity characterized not 
merely as making rational choices, but rather accorded to the pragmatic 
orientation (Rasanen, 2009 ) of farmers who, in the course of producing 
food needed to resolve and “make do” ( de Certeau, 2013 ) with different 
matters they faced in their everyday farming lives. In understanding care 
as a form of relating rather than as an emotion (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2019 ; Krzywoszynska, 2016 ) we found that forms of ‘caring for’ was 
revealed most strongly in the “metabolic relations ” (Bertoni, 2013 ) of 
(multispecies) feeding — feeding the compost with organic matter, 
feeding earthworms organic matter in the (making of) compost, feeding 
screaming cows and other animals whose manure was essential for the 
compost, feeding the soils with compost which fed the plants, which 
ultimately would feed people. Even in cases such as the composted 
zucchini and the salvaged garlic — in which a clash of expectations and 
rhythms between markets, plant growth, and shelf life resounded — for 
farmers, ‘feeding ’ the compost was simply the next best thing to do. 
Through these kinds of metabolic processes of decomposition, 
farmers came to know their soils in particular ways, generating 
materially-bound and embedded relations. Allowing organic matter to 
decompose and feeding soils with farm-made compost,14 preparing 
fermented liquid sprays, carefully calculating nutrient fertilizers, and 
piling organic matter into raised beds illuminated how allowing for and 
encouraging processes of decomposition were ways of caring for soils. 
Yet these feeding processes pointed to the complexity that ‘caring for’ 
entailed in the agricultural context —a complexity which, in the Western 
worldview, is reduced to uniquely human pursuits by making use of 
natural resources (Suzman, 2020 ). 
The complex dimensions of care became particularly visible in farms 
that kept animals. The prevailing practice in most agriculture is to keep 
animals for turning them into a product that can be sold and consumed. 
14 Only three of the farms that we visited used compost or fertilizers sourced 
from outside the farm, these being made from residue of municipal sewage 
waste, side-streams of the forestry industry, or household biowaste. In these 
cases as well, farmers familiarized themselves with the processes of decompo -
sition and gained knowledge about the quality of the composts through their 
usage. While not having a chance to follow decomposition, they nontheless 
came to know compost in the ways it worked in the fields. What its constistency 
was, if it contained plastic bits, or if it burned the plants, as one farmer 
described. Such information was unattainable from searching webpages, 
watching youtube videos, or reading scientific articles, but could be shared on 
peer-to-peer encouters. G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

9In the farms we visited, animals could indeed supply meat for con-
sumption by humans, but not only humans; wool for textiles, but also for 
insulative mulch to care for plants; eggs for consumption, and their 
shells for compost to care for soils and plants. Thus, while the practices 
and processes of rearing animals are ostensibly dominated by market- 
oriented relations of production, a closer inspection shows that far 
more complex relations of care were being continuously cultivated — 
and for reasons that far exceed their direct market value. 
Yet, when associated with market-oriented relations of production, 
all other kinds of relations tend to be subjugated. This can be challenged: 
while the cow whose death Galina witnessed was subsequently trans -
formed into meat for consumption, this relation (killing an animal) was 
merely one, and at this particular farm, a relatively rare one amongst 
others. The other relations — balancing the number of animals so as to 
be able to manage pastures sustainably, make compost, properly care for 
newborns, cultivate biodiversity and act as companions — were far more 
important than meat within that farming context. Focusing not only on 
this multiplicity of relations, but also on those relations which were 
primarily implicated in the life of organisms and materials, helps to 
clarify how these relations were “foregrounded in order to achieve 
something” (Bertoni, 2013: 81). That is, by attending to the relations 
that are considered most important or prominent in the life of 
some-thing, it becomes possible to ask “for whom are they important, 
and to what ends?". In doing so, we not only found various relations of 
care being practiced, but this also allowed us to understand the kinds of 
“external goods” (MacIntyre 2007) — institutional expectations and 
requirements — that continuously shape and influence the “internal 
goods” (ibid.), that is, relations that occur ‘within’ the practices of 
regeneration, and intend to affect the non-market-oriented ways of 
knowing landscapes. 
Considering the statement by one farmer, Iris, allows us to take a step 
further into considering relations of care. Iris asserted that “cows process 
the grass which humans can’t and turn it into this black gold that we then 
use to grow food for the local community”. Here, Iris foregrounds a set of 
relations that are put in motion to achieve some-thing (and not another 
thing) in particular: the ability of animals to pasture, eat and digest 
grass. Foregrounding these relations allows us to see animals as care-
takers of the soils, turning meadows into traditional biotopes, feeding 
the soils with valuable nutrients, and ‘cleaning’ beds from unwanted 
pests. Ultimately, we came to understand that for the farmers, re-
lationships of care with animals were not merely instrumental, but — as 
Kimmerer (2013) has shown with plants — reciprocal: animals also 
provided care for their caretakers. 
Essentially, composting was both an embodiment and a reflection of 
love and care: what the animals ate ended up directly in the compost, in 
the soils, in the plants that were grown in those soils, and in the beings 
who ate the plants. Knowing both soils and plants through composting 
included not only knowing — and caring about — what went into the 
compost, but also the ability to identify its quality through making and 
using the compost, and following the processes of decomposition and 
plant growth. As an act of care, compost that was added to soils was 
intended to feed the soils with nutrients to augment robust soils. For the 
farmers with whom we worked, healthy soils meant a high content of 
bacterial life and penetrable soil structure that could be observed when 
sowing, transplanting, digging and ‘opening up’ the soils, but also, and 
equally when eating the food. Earthworms, spiders, and other insects, 
colors of different layers as well as long and strong roots were signs of 
good soils; feeding this ‘invisible’ food web (Ingham and Slaughter 
2004) enabled building organic matter, which, for some farmers, as we 
came to learn, increasingly meant that carbon was being sequestered. 
Finally, care, as we experienced it ethnographically, was not easy: it 
was demanding, laborious, tiresome, and exhausting (see also Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2019). Having animals meant being tied to their caretaking 
every single day, year-round; using self-made compost for the plants 
meant a lot of work and dedication, it meant budgeting to pay others to 
help with that work, or else finding volunteers who wanted to help, which in turn required yet more care work. 
6.3. Attending to rhythms of (re)production 
Agricultural landscapes are places of myriad temporalities that can 
materialize in short, medium, and long term (Ingold, 1993). Regener -
ating and maintaining healthy soils, planting trees, tending to animal, 
plant and human needs, and responding to both market demands and 
legal regulations brought together multiple rhythms that were in con-
stant tension, and often not aligned (Kallio and Houtbeckers, 2020). 
These discordant meshworks facilitated possibilities of knowing that 
were both generated from within the agricultural landscapes and by 
external forces such as market demands and legal requirements. Our 
fieldwork with/in regenerative agricultural landscapes revealed how, in 
the words of Puig de la Bellacasa (2015: 691) “the dominant drive to 
understand soils has been the pacing of their fertility with intensified 
rhythms of production”. We observed that the pacing of soil fertility was 
more often than not in friction with seasonalities and reproductive 
rhythms of more-than-human beings, and these frictions came to define 
temporalities of the landscapes. 
The practice of composting allowed us to see how multiple different 
rhythms — those of the animals, soils, plants, weather, farm workers, 
hygiene and safety regulations, the markets — came together in agri-
cultural landscapes to form a foundational cycle. For example, the 
salvaged garlic gives a sense of this clash of multiple rhythms in tension. 
The garlic had been harvested the previous year, saved for seed, planted 
with compost, weeded and watered, grown and harvested. In the end, 
some garlic was considered unfit for sale, usually because some bulbs or 
cloves had begun showing rot, meaning it couldn’t be stored for the 
longer term. It was thus diverted from its path as a commodity to a new 
path as fodder for microbial decomposition in the compost, which would 
support the growth of new crops in the following year. This example 
shows a complex interplay of rhythms and relations: the shelflife of 
vegetables in their raw and processed forms and the process of growing 
vegetables over a season, as well as what is considered ‘edible’ and by 
whom. The farmer’s notion of edible differed from Will’s notion, both of 
which differed in relation to hygiene and food safety regulations that 
required (processed) goods to come with expiration dates. On one hand, 
handling garlic in the farm was a thoroughly sensuous process, while on 
the other hand expiration dates that are determined by regulations can 
often seem to be at odds with sensory analysis of a product, or knowl -
edge of a products shelf life after processing in a certain way. 
The making of the compost was one cycle of rhythms patterning 
work at farms. It took one year to make a good compost with animal 
manure. During winter time, animals produced manure, which, mixed 
with litter, was emptied in the spring time into a big pile to decompose 
until the next year. Thus, compost that had been made the previous year 
was spread into the fields in the spring. It was here, through engaging in 
the making of compost, where the reproductive cycles of animals — 
cycles of life and death — became sensible to us, engendering particular 
ways of knowing: smelling the pungency of decomposition in the air, or 
the sweet earthy scent of compost ready for the fields; developing re-
lations with the animals sent to butcher houses in the spring, while 
shoveling their manure for fertilizer in the fields the next year. 
Although there was continuous attention to both plants and animals, 
attending to the needs of the plants and animals differed, at times 
radically, especially between those farmers who focused primarily on 
production for the markets and those focusing on enhancing the repro -
ductive capacities of their multispecies community. For instance, we 
learned that in Finland, chickens don’t lay eggs during the winter time 
due to the lack of daylight and nutrients that they usually receive from 
the pastures. In order to accommodate the expectations that market 
rhythms have generated, farmers used artificial lights and added protein 
to the fodder of the chickens to encourage egg production and maintain 
it through the winter time. Such rhythms of production for the markets 
don’t typically make space for chickens or other animals to go through G. Kallio and W. LaFleur

10with their biologically reproductive cycles. 
Similarly with plants, reproductive cycles are rarely reached in 
conventional farms as farmers growing vegetables typically purchase 
brand new seed each year, often from subsidiaries of global seed com-
panies. In our experiences however, we observed that the production of 
annual crops (as well as perennials) was paced to the yearly cycles of 
farmers ’ (re)productive processes, which included the making of 
compost. Farmers needed to save, select, process, and store the seeds to 
use and acclimatize them year after year, or else find seeds from various 
networks of growers and community seed banks. If using multiple types 
of animal manure, they would need to understand which kinds of 
compost would suit certain types of plants. In these processes, the 
farmers developed a sense and an understanding not only of the repro -
ductive capacities of the plants but also of their characters — in ways 
quite similar to how Kimmerer (2013) described her reciprocity with 
wild strawberries. This extended also to soils over time, for instance, the 
farmer who observed his soils to produce abundant harvests despite the 
increasingly extreme weather (one cold and wet year, followed by two 
hot and dry years) and the results of the soil nutrient analysis. The 
farmer whose crop growth appeared anomalous with the extreme 
weather and the soil analyses had been farming his land for 10 years. But 
prior to this the farm had operated as the first biodynamic farm in 
Finland for 30 years, using, as the farmer expressed “the same compost ” 
to feed the soils with. 
One of the most fascinating temporalities present in the farms was 
related to the emergent focus on regenerative farms working as carbon 
sequestering landscapes. While Puig de la Bellacasa (2014) reminds us 
that the pace of soil care is a long-term game, the pressure of becoming 
the so-called carbon farmer was palpable in that some farmers appeared 
eager to ‘know ’ how carbon was becoming sensible in their soils. 
Although carbon was not immediately available for sense perception, 
farmers were keen to look for traces or signs in the soil that carbon might 
be present. For farmers it was critically important to know the quality of 
their soils, but knowing carbon was a brand-new relationality, influ-
enced by scientific and policy discourses external to the farm, that was 
guiding regenerative farmers ’ attention and thus starting to influence 
their relations and ways of knowing their landscapes. 
7.Landscape relations: becoming (un)known 
This article has been motivated by an understanding that landscape, 
in both its practical and metaphorical uses, is an important analytical 
and political concept. Regenerative agriculture, as something being 
pursued by both global corporate empires and small farmers hoping to 
radically transform food systems, is an ideal context to understand how 
different relationalities emerge, for whom, and toward what ends. 
Recognizing the significance of regenerative agricultural landscapes in 
rural planning, policymaking and everyday life, we have sought to 
better understand multiple ways of knowing landscapes by following 
three relational dynamics that we came to “notice ’’ (see Tsing 2015 : 
17–26) in the course of fieldwork, and which led us to analyze the 
multiplicity of relations that constitute regenerative agricultural land-
scapes. In what follows we wish to discuss 1) representations as a 
particular form of relating and the implications of (un)knowing regen -
erative agricultural landscapes through representations 2) the multi -
plicity of relations that proximate and emplaced ways of knowing 
generate and why these matter, and 3) acknowledging reciprocal rela-
tionalities (ˇa la Kimmerer, 2013 ) as a way of reorienting the practices, 
policies and science of regenerative agriculture. In doing so, we situate 
our analysis in a way that aims to trouble techno-scientific representa -
tional knowledges in the context of regenerative agricultural landscapes, 
and how they become (un)known in relation to the most prescient 
question in the scientific and intergovernmental spheres, namely, the 
‘carbon problem ’. 
An implicit assumption embedded in the knowledge practices of 
Science, as Baptista (2018) points out in the case of ecology, is the idea that “[i]n order to achieve legitimacy, knowledge has to represent ” 
(Baptista, 2018 : 399, see also Latour, 2004 ; Stengers, 2016 ). At the same 
time, Baptista reminds, “representing and representations are a form of 
relating ” (Baptista, p. 399, our emphasis). Indeed, our ethnographic 
work led us to be concerned that even when placing a deeper focus on 
soils — even when representing them differently (Kearnes and Rickards, 
2020 ; Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019 ) 
— there is a danger of (re)producing ways of knowing that are detached 
from farmers ’ proximate, emplaced relationalities, and thus threaten to 
marginalize and endanger the particular sensuous ways of knowing that 
unfold in the practices of regenerative agriculture in which we 
participated. 
This point is illustrated through our focus on composting practices. 
While the procurement, making, and use of compost is ostensibly only 
one aspect of a farms ’ operations, our vignette and analysis reveals the 
relational extent to which composting practices and processes of 
decomposition figure into nearly every aspect of regenerative farming. 
As soon as any of these practices are cut out from the relations that give 
rise to them and turned into ‘data ’, that which is inhabited becomes 
reduced to static “optical scapes ” (Ingold 2012 : 207) rendering the 
multiplicity of landscape relations invisible. As Puig Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2012 , 2) states, “the very category of data exposes that something [else] 
is ‘not data ’“, such that other, non-datafied relations become a mere 
‘residue ’ which is excluded from knowledge and made invisible. This 
erasure of relations appears to be the case with the carbon farming push, 
and especially the imposition of carbon markets upon the practices of 
regenerative agriculture. 
From the understandings we have generated through tracing more- 
than-human relations in regenerative agriculture there is an essential 
point to be raised. At its core, the corporate-backed promotion of carbon 
farming is primarily focused on transitioning conventional agriculture 
towards regenerative, carbon capturing agriculture (IDS and IPES-Food, 
2022 ). Rather than any radical transformation of the food system to-
wards food sovereignty, self-reliant and post-capitalist food econo -
mies,15 this proposed transition toward regenerative carbon farming not 
only enables the maintenance of the existing and increasingly extractive 
power-dynamics in the industrial agri-food complex (Chagnon et al., 
2022 ; Shiva 2016 , 2022 ; Ye et al., 2020 ), but also — and not unrelatedly 
— threatens to radically reshape the relations that many regenerative 
farmers currently orient themselves towards: polycropping, seed-saving, 
making one’s own compost fertilizers, investing in community building, 
organizing direct sales and community supported agriculture (CSA), and 
keeping diverse animals or tending to plants for reasons that exceed 
their market value. 
Interestingly, though not surprisingly, when looking into the rela-
tional dynamics of control and cohabitation, of caring for and taking 
care of, and of attending to multiple rhythms of (re)production, we 
found that the measurement of soil carbon — or closely following soil 
nutrient analyses, or generating satellite images that could indicate 
photosynthesis of the crops — was not intrinsic, or even relevant for 
skillfully accomplishing the everyday work in regenerative farming. 
Rather, instances in which farmers mentioned carbon sequestration or 
looked for signs of carbon in their soils invariably justified their actions 
as being related to the (geo)political ‘carbon problem ’. Such modes of 
emplaced practice encouraged farmers to ‘gaze ’ at their own practice by 
taking a view from above — from the outside of their own practice — as 
an “ex-habitant ” of a landscape occupied by soils rather than as “in-
habitants ” of the weather-world where “there is no distinct surface 
separating earth and sky” (Ingold 2008 : 1804). Indeed, just as we have 
made visible with compost “[l]ife is rather lived in a zone in which 
substance and medium are brought together in the constitution of beings

11which, in their activity, participate in weaving the textures of the land ” 
(Ingold 2008 : 1804; see also Latour 2018 ). 
At a time when countless scholars16 have argued that modern 
humanity ’s extractivist relation to the world prevents the sustainability 
of anything, it merits asking: what becomes (un)known — in sensory 
experience, in ways of ecological knowing and relating — by encour -
aging farmers to primarily attend to carbon in their soil? What becomes 
(un)known when farmers are encouraged to farm via representations of 
farming, to rely on ‘the data ’ instead of long emplaced experience in the 
field? If we consider that it is only the reproduction of practices that 
enables them to continue, which ways of knowing or relating might 
become unpracticed ? We argue that the devaluation — through reducing 
landscapes to soils, and soils to carbon — of emplaced, sentient 
ecological knowledge practices allows regenerative agricultural land-
scapes to become unknown in these critically important ways. 
Having argued this, our aim is not to suggest that ‘proximate ’ 
knowing is by definition better (or worse) than ‘knowing at a distance ’, 
but rather to argue that the nature of the relations through which knowing 
emerges matters . Our conceptualization of landscapes as materializations 
of more-than-human relations has been to acknowledge their aliveness, 
but while differentiating it from especially technoscientific approaches 
to aliveness that require the stasis and reduction of landscapes to cate-
gorized representations. Instead, we have sought to evoke a form of 
aliveness that is embedded in a sentient ecology that requires reciprocal 
relations which, as Kimmerer (2013) elegantly urges, recognize the 
ability of living beings to reciprocate. If reciprocity is assumed to 
operate on the basis of working ‘with nature ’ rather than against it, it 
merits to ask: what, in the context of regenerative agriculture, is being 
reciprocated and how? As we came to realize, composting suggests one 
form of reciprocity, as does feeding and attending to the reproductive 
cycles of plants and animals. Thus, when thinking of landscape relations 
in terms of reciprocity one faces questions of how to engage with plants, 
animals, soils and other materials and living beings: whose needs are 
being reciprocated and how? On whose terms, and for the benefit of 
whom? These are questions that we have attempted to address in this 
article. 
Lastly, the critique and arguments we have brought forth would be 
remiss without indicating what alternative pathways might lie beyond 
the realms of representation. Fortunately many authors have already 
begun blazing a trail. While there is not space to pursue this further here, 
we do wish to point readers to some academic work that has attempted 
to address the more-than-human beyond standard scientific represen -
tational practices, and has begun working to legitimate forms of 
knowledge production that have long been excluded from the scope of 
Western scientific theories of knowledge — particularly the kinds of 
knowing generated through arts-based practices (Heinrichs, 2019 ; 
Heinrichs and Kagan, 2019 ). A more-than-human approach to agricul -
tural landscapes would attempt moving beyond (though not abandon -
ing) language and articulation (Barad, 2007 ; Krzywoszynska, 2019 ), 
attending to the politics of visceral experience17 (Hayes-Conroy and 
Hayes-Conroy, 2008 , 2010 ) and inquiring, as we have done here, after 
practices of correspondence (Ingold, 2021 ) with more-than-human 
landscapes in the process of their generation. Alternative representa -
tions might include radical images of soil life (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2019 ), video, sound and other multisensory installations (Pink, 2015 ), 
ethnographic fiction (Jacobson and Larsen 2014 ), storying landscape 
relations (LaFleur, 2023), seed mandalas, or poetry (Williams, 2022 ). At 
the very least, it is clear that representations derived from distant ways of knowing, and which command the lion’s share of scientific authority 
and legitimacy, do not deserve to go unquestioned. 
Author contributions 
This article builds on the work of Galina Kallio on landscape aes-
thetics in regenerative agriculture published in Finnish (Kallio 2022 ). In 
this article, the conceptualizations, data sets, methodologies, and anal-
ysis are new and, as well as the writing and administration for this 
article, were undertaken equally by both authors.

17Hayes-Conroy and Hayes-Conrory describe visceral politics as “a move to-
wards a radically relational view of the world, in which structural modes of 
critique are brought together with an appreciation of chaotic, unstructured 
ways in which bodily intensities unfold in the production of everyday life”. G. Kallio and W.
