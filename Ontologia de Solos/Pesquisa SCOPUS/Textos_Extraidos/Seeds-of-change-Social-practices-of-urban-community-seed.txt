ABSTRACT
The sharing of seeds is a practice with ancient roots. However, the
structures of global agri-food trade in late modernity have drasticallyreconﬁgured practices of exchange and reshaped matters of legal
ownership, resulting in constrained access to seeds for many. Scholarsand activists are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts
these changes are having from a justice and sustainability perspective.
To date, seed sharing research has predominantly occurred as oneelement of wider seed sovereignty debates, and particularly in relation
to farmers in low- and middle-income countries. Seed sharing beyond
these contexts has received limited attention. To broadenunderstanding of seed sharing and its diverse practices, this paper
provides a foundational landscape level analysis of urban community
seed sharing initiatives from 100 urban locations globally. It outlines the
rules, tools, skills and understandings that shape seed sharing practices
and teases out commonalities with, and di ﬀerences between, these
urban activities and those that currently dominate the landscape of
seed sharing research. In conclusion, further research is proposed to
build on these foundations and establish the contributions, actual and
potential, that urban seed sharing provides for just transitions to more
sustainable urban food systems .ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
A plethora of reports have outlined the unsustainability of the global food system (IPBES 2019 ;
Benton et al. 2021 ; SAPEA 2020 ). These reports identify the negative impacts currently created
from food production right through to its disposal, highlighting the need for radical transformation
in order to reorient practices towards sustainability. Seeds –and the ways they are acquired, stored,
used and exchanged –form a fundamental element of the food system and concerns about how
global agri-food trade and its associated rules and regulations regarding the patenting, ownershipand transfer of seeds are widespread (O ’Grady Walshe 2019 ). A coalition of concerned voices has led
to the emergence of an expanding seed sovereignty movement calling for attention to matters ofsocial justice, agrobiodiversity and community resilience in relation to seeds (Kloppenburg 2010 ).
Although often loosely de ﬁned, seed sovereignty is generally taken to mean the right to save,
replant, breed as well as share seed and to participate in shaping seed policies (Kloppenburg

2014 ). Within seed sovereignty movements, seed sharing is seen as a practice of exchange that can
help achieve social justice and sustainability (La Via Campesina and GRAIN 2015 ; PBS Food 2014 ).
Although there is no common de ﬁnition of seed sharing in existing academic literature, for the
purposes of this paper we modify a de ﬁnition of food sharing established by Davies ( 2019 )a s
follows: seed sharing involves the process of collecting, saving and exchanging seeds (and other
generative material such as cuttings, pseudostems or tubers) with others in a non-commercial
(but not necessarily non-monetary) manner. Under this de ﬁnition we include di ﬀerent modes of
exchange, including seed swapping, bartering, collecting, and selling (on a not-for-pro ﬁt basis).
These practices may involve reciprocal and non-reciprocal transactions, reﬂ ecting a wide conception
of sharing that can be both economic/transactional and social/relational (Davies and Evans 2018 ).
As there has been limited speciﬁ c examination of seed sharing as a collective practice, this paper
provides foundational work by examining ﬁrst how existing research engages with seed sharing and
then by conducting empirical analysis of an emergent arena of activity, urban seed sharing. While
studies of food (and by association seed) sovereignty movements have predominantly focused onrural areas of low- or middle-income countries, such activities are also occurring within urban
locations (Davies 2019 ). This is unsurprising given that more than half of the world ’s population is
already urban (FAO 2018 ). While urban areas are major sites of food consumption, they often also
incorporate some degree of food production. The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated increasedinterest in expanding the productive capacity of urban areas to ensure less reliance on imported
food with long food chains, which have been shown to be fragile in the face of global shocks.There is also increasing consideration of the role that emerging technologies, such as information
and communication technologies (ICT), might play in enhancing food resilience amongst commu-
nities through greater transparency, connectivity and traceability, particularly in urban locations(Lang 2020 ). Despite this, deliberation on urban seed sharing of any kind is, to date, limited. In
response, the aim of this paper is to expand consideration of seed sharing into the urban realm.Speciﬁcally, the landscape of urban seed sharing which utilises some form of ICT, such as websites,
apps, platforms and social media to mediate its sharing, will be interrogated and the place of justice
and sustainability within those practices delineated. This sub-sample of urban seed sharing activity is
selected for practical and empirical reasons. Practically, such activities leave a digital trace for empiri-cal analysis across multiple locations internationally, allowing for interrogation of whether such
mediation provides novel characteristics to seed sharing practices. Speci ﬁcally, two questions are
addressed: (a) What are the social practices of ICT-mediated urban seed sharing? And (b) What do
these practices mean for justice and sustainability?
In this paper, we ﬁrst examine the existing landscape of research interrogating seed sharing inter-
nationally. We consider this research through the lens of social practice theory in order to delineateﬁrst what it means to share seeds for those involved and the skills and knowledge needed to meet
their sharing goals, and second how those goals and performances are in turn shaped by the toolsand technologies employed and by social and political rules and regulations. We then outline ourmethodological approach for identifying and analysing ICT-mediated urban seed sharing initiatives
and the results of applying that approach within a sample of 100 urban areas internationally. Find-
ings from this empirical study are then compared to existing research, with conclusions drawn aboutcommonalities and di ﬀerences in practices and the potential of urban seed sharing in achieving just
transitions to sustainable urban food systems. Finally, a prospective agenda for deeper considerationof urban seed sharing and its role in transforming the food system are outlined.
Seed sharing in practice
Existing literature in which mention of seed sharing appears was initially identi ﬁed through
advanced keyword searches of the Web of Science database using the terms: “seed sharing ”;“com-
munity seed bank* ”;“sharing seed* ”;“seed exchange” ;“seed sav* ”;“seed swap* ”;“seed librar*” ,
where the asterisk is used in the Boolean search in order to capture all relevant terms (e.g. librar*LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 785
= library, libraries; sav* = savers, saving etc.). The review process revealed that multiple terms related
to seed sharing are often used in papers –including seed exchange, seed transfer, seed circulation,
seed saving, and seed swapping –sometimes interchangeably, often loosely, and without de ﬁnition.
We considered papers that utilise all these terms to ensure coverage of the landscape of seed sharingresearch.
The broad term exchange is used widely in the literature when referring to seed networks (Pau-
tasso et al. 2013 ) and is de ﬁned by Chambers and Brush ( 2010 , 306) as “the movement of plant repro-
ductive materials, including seeds and cuttings, from farmer to farmer and between and acrosslandscapes ”. Abizaid, Coomes, and Perrault-archambault ( 2016 ) and Bertacchini ( 2008 ) both make
a distinction between seed exchange as an explicitly reciprocal practice, and broader terms ofseed sharing or seed transfer that are not restricted to reciprocal relations. Additionally, the termseed saving, de ﬁned as “the practice of selecting, collecting, drying and storing seed for subsequent
generations of plants ”(Pottinger 2017 , 217), appears frequently in the literature alongside mention
of seed sharing (e.g. Bohn et al. 2016 ; Pottinger 2018 ; Curry 2019 ).
The term seed swapping also appears in the literature, generally referring to organised events
where gardeners gather to exchange seeds and knowledge (Pottinger 2017 ; Campbell 2012 ),
although it is not always the case that the means of exchange are explicitly prescribed, allowingfor variable practices in this regard. Seed saver groups often encourage people to save, harvest
and share their own seeds in order to build a stronger and more secure food system (Seed Savers
Exchange 2021 ). In a study of Californian seed libraries (institutions that o ﬀer seeds to people as “bor-
rowers ”, following the model of book lending), Soleri ( 2018 ) found that developing a culture of
sharing without commercial pro ﬁt was a primary goal. Sharing saved seed allows growers to diversify
the range of plants cultivated and adapt to changing conditions, as well as to share knowledge andgrowing tips (Campbell 2012 ).
In the analysis of academic literature on seed sharing, we found papers discussing seed sharing
practices on all continents except Antarctica. The majority of these focus on low- and middle- incomecountries, with a notable focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and on rural areas, generally
among smallholder farming communities. These papers primarily examine farmer-to-farmer seed
exchanges or exchanges via community seed banks, seed libraries or seed swaps, as opposed tocommercial seed systems involving the seed industry and national seed distribution programmes.
Non-commercial seed exchange remains vital for seed supply; it is the source for over 80% of
farmers ’seed for key crops in many areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America (Bertacchini 2008 ;
Bonnave et al. 2016 ; Mcguire and Sperling 2016 ; Rodier and Struik 2018 ). Studies of seed systems
in smallholder communities reveal a diversity of seed sources and modes of exchange (collecting,gifting, bartering and selling) and the co-existence of local landraces and commercial seed (Almekin-ders, Ronner, and Van Heerwaarden 2020 ; Bohn et al. 2016 ; Dedeurwaerdere and Hannachi 2019 ).
Two studies conducted in semi-rural communities, one within Argentina (Eyssartier, Ladio, and
Lozada 2013 ) and another in Bangladesh (Oakley and Momsen 2007 )
both found that seed
sharing was more prominent in communities with less access to an urban centre and market
economy, where there was a higher dependence on agriculture and greater preservation of tra-
ditional customs. However, a few studies have examined seed sharing among urban and peri-urban dwellers in high-income countries, such as suburban gardeners in the UK (Pottinger 2018 )
and seed libraries and seed saving networks in the US, where seed sharing represents a centralpart of their activities (Campbell and Veteto 2015 ; Soleri 2018 ).
Across the literature, seed sharing is generally a localised activity, more prevalent among small-
scale and geographically proximal networks. This is unsurprising as sharing has tended to take placeamongst those with existing social relationships and involving indigenous seed varieties that areadapted to local conditions (Pautasso et al. 2013 ). Nonetheless, there is also evidence of the
exchange of seeds between di ﬀerent communities and across longer distances, through translocal
seed banks, and seed swaps as well as through distribution by NGOs and development institutions(Chambers and Brush 2010 ; Bohn et al. 2016 ; Zimmerer 2003 ). This translocalisation of seed sharing,786 A. R. DAVIES ET AL.
while potentially important for agrobiodiversity, can lead to an increased risk of spreading disease
and may erode local varieties if not properly managed (Pautasso et al. 2013 ). Certainly, seed
sharing is not necessarily a just and sustainable practice; there may be unequal access to seed
within communities and a scarcity of high quality seeds. The time and workload involved in seed
sharing may also be prohibitive for some, pushing growers back into mainstream commercialseed markets (Calvet-Mir et al. 2012 ; Rodier and Struik 2018 ; Coomes et al. 2015 ). Despite these chal-
lenges, seed sharing initiatives are operating in many locations around the globe and more researchis required to identify what kinds of seed sharing o ﬀer the most potential for assisting just transitions
towards more sustainable food systems. As a ﬁrst step in this direction, we use a social practice lens
in the following section to delve more deeply into existing literature to identify the motivationsdriving, and the mechanisms adopted by, seed sharing initiatives.
Social practices of seed sharing
The speciﬁ c practice theory lens used in this paper is derived from recent work exploring social
change for sustainability (Davies, Fahy, and Rau 2014 ) and, more speciﬁ cally, the social practices
of food sharing (Davies and Evans 2018 ; Davies et al. 2020 ). It builds on Schatzki ’s seminal work
(1996 ), in which practices are conceived as “open-ended spatial –temporal manifolds of actions”
(Schatzki 2005 , 471), or structures of knowledge that enable a socially shared way of ascribing
meaning to the world (Città et al. 2019 ). Social practices, in this reading, represent a routinised
type of behaviour typically performed and shared by people (Reckwitz 2002 ). In relation to food
sharing (see Davies et al. 2020 ), Reckwitz ’s categories of practice are presented as having four
core elements: (1) Rules –“explicit formulations, principles, precepts, and instructions that enjoin,
direct or remonstrate people to perform speciﬁ c actions ”(Reckwitz 2002 , 79); (2) Tools, which are
the mechanisms through which sharing goals are realised, including but not restricted to the tech-nologies that mediate sharing. (3) Skills –“a range of normativized and hierarchically ordered ends,
projects and tasks, to varying degrees allied with normativized emotions and even mood ”(idem, 80);
and (4) Understandings –“knowing how to X, knowing how to identify X-ings, and knowing how to
prompt as well as respond to X-ings ”(idem, 77). For brevity, these are referred to as rules, tools, skills
and understandings in the remainder of this paper.
In the following section, skills and understandings are considered, which outline the meanings
and mechanisms of, including motives and drivers for, seed sharing. Then the social and politicalrules and tools that shape and mediate seed sharing are distilled from the literature. Finally, the
analysis outlines the scope and reach of existing research in seed sharing and identi ﬁes a gap in
studies relating to ICT-mediated seed sharing in urban contexts.
Seed sharing: skills and understandings
Seed sharing builds skills and understandings in relation to, but also far beyond, the seed itself. Exist-ing research identi ﬁes numerous drivers and motives for exchanging seed, which collectively outline
the meanings of seed sharing practices. These include the desire to improve crop yields, to obtain
particular plant characteristics, to experiment with new crops and varieties, or to replace lost or
failed seeds (Chambers and Brush 2010 ). In turn, this strengthens economic and social sustainability
and socio-ecological resilience, helping cultivators to adapt to changing climate, market and regu-
latory conditions (Coomes et al. 2015 ). In this way, seed sharing can contribute to achieving
enhanced social-ecological sustainability and intergenerational justice (Sievers-Glotzbach et al.2020 ). Studies have shown that seed sharing is crucial to agrobiodiversity conservation, by facilitat-
ing access to seeds and maintaining crop genetic diversity (Calvet-Mir et al. 2012 ; Chambers and
Brush 2010 ; Pautasso et al. 2013 ). Seed sharing practices, such as the exchange of seeds between
neighbours, relatives and strangers, represent a deliberate form of human seed dispersal that distri-butes genetic material across geographical spaces (Van Heerwaarden et al. 2012 ). Aside fromLOCAL ENVIRONMENT 787
acquiring physical seeds, another factor that motivates people to engage in seed sharing is the pro-
spect of gaining agricultural knowledge and skills from donors and recipients (Campbell 2012 ; Rodier
and Struik 2018 ).
Research indicates that seed sharing practices are also driven and reshaped by the interplay of
social and cultural factors. In some cultures, seeds are gifted at special events like weddings(Dennis et al. 2007 ) or local festivals, with seed sharing interlinked with spiritual beliefs
(Chapman 2018 ; Saxena 2020 ). The gifting and sharing of seed builds socio-cultural capital
between neighbours, relations or friends, where seeds (and knowledge about them) are sharedout of a sense of moral duty, love, to build a good reputation or sometimes in exchange for
labour (Chapman 2018 ; Rodier and Struik 2018 ; Saxena 2020 ). Some authors have identi ﬁed a
reduction in seed sharing among family members, and in its place, the rise of organised peer-
to-peer seed exchange networks (Aistara 2011 ). In Odisha, India, traditional community seed festi-
vals have been revived as a result of grassroots self-organisation, with an aim of strengthening indi-genous food systems threatened by industrial agriculture (Saxena 2020 ). Research has also
identiﬁed how certain social, cultural and gender norms can in ﬂuence the way seed sharing is prac-
ticed (Almekinders, Ronner, and Van Heerwaarden 2020 ; Oakley and Momsen 2007 ; Tadesse et al.
2017 ).
Seed sharing: tools and rules
The tools used to facilitate seed sharing are manifold, ranging from the materials for storing, packa-
ging and transporting seeds, to the various forms of ICT employed to display seeds for sharing,
exchange skills about using shared seeds and facilitate exchanges between sharers. While thereare many tools involved in seed sharing, existing literature has tended to focus on the role of emer-
ging technologies.
Since the Green Revolution in the mid-twentieth century, the application of technological tools to
agriculture has seen the development of so-called “improved ”seeds, hybrids and genetically
modiﬁed organisms (GMOs), along with the use of agrochemicals and chemical fertilisers. While
these developments have brought opportunities to produce disease-resistant crops and improve
yields, they have also led to the expansion of monocultures, undermining ecosystems and locally-
based food production systems (IPBES 2019 ). While such biotechnology has been promoted as a sol-
ution to poverty and food insecurity (AGRA 2021 ; Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology 2004 ;
Wall Street Journal 2016 ), critics see it as a pro ﬁt-driven enterprise that restricts autonomy and
appropriates knowledge and genetic material while failing to address the issue of food access;
with activist groups terming it biopiracy (La Via Campesina and GRAIN 2015 ; Moseley 2017 ).
Indeed, research has found that seed sharing is sometimes seen as a form of resistance against
their commodi ﬁcation, such as Zapatista corn distributed in Mexico and to solidarity growers
around the world (Brandt 2014 ).
Key to all forms of seed sharing is the transmission of knowledge, skills and access to tools for
good seed management. However, research has found that seed is more easily shared than tech-
nical know-how (Kiptot et al. 2006 ). Some authors argue that, in contrast to other digital sharing
economies, seed sharing represents a more analogue sharing economy that involves everyday
forms of hands-on engagement with material artefacts and is often o ﬄine (Pottinger 2018 ; Pee-
khaus 2018 ). However, others (Havinga et al. 2016 ) suggest that digital technologies are playing
an increasingly important role in seed sharing activities. This includes collecting data fromfarmers and providing information on weather forecasts, crop management and seed suppliers,
as explored by Vernooy et al. ( 2017 ,2020 ) in India and Uganda. In research among seed saver
groups in the United States, Campbell ( 2012 ) cites online seed exchanges, gardening websites
and blogs that link participants and allow them to trade seeds, whilst also revealing a preferencefor face-to-face swapping to obtain locally adapted varieties and discuss techniques and conditionswith locally experienced growers. Online and o ﬄine seed exchanges are then not mutually788 A. R. DAVIES ET AL.
exclusive, with examples combining traditional face-to-face exchanges of material objects with
new technologies and digital channels to facilitate seed sharing.
Seed sharing practices are governed by a complex regulatory landscape of seed laws, including
intellectual property laws (patents and plant variety protection), free trade and investment agree-ments, as well as regulations relating to seed certi ﬁcation, marketing and biosafety (see, e.g. La
Vía Campesina and GRAIN 2015 ). Key among these is the International Union for the Protection of
New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), which is shaping global rules by restricting or prohibiting thesaving or sharing of privatised seeds (Alianza Biodiversidad and GRAIN 2021 ). In response, civil
society and activist groups have been mobilising against the enclosure and commodi ﬁcation of
seeds through laws that they argue result in the infringement of people ’s rights to access and use
seed, forming a movement for seed sovereignty, or seed activism (Peschard and Randeria 2019 ).
Complicated legal frameworks plus the diversity of informal seed sharing groups have meant that
public policy often excludes smallholder farmers and other seed sharing initiatives such as commu-
nity seed banks (Aguilar-Stoen, Moe, and Camargo-Ricalde 2009 ; Vernooy et al. 2020 ) or holds them
accountable to the standards designed for commercial seed practices, making it increasingly challen-
ging for such initiatives to operate (Davies 2019 ).
Community groups and advocacy organisations play a vital role in disseminating information and
driving policy change to protect non-commercial seed sharing. Initiatives include the publication ofresources and information on seed laws around the world (Center for Food Safety 2021 ; EJ Atlas
2015 ; Sustainable Economies Law Center 2021 ) and directories of bioregional companies that do
not use patented seeds (Rocky Mountain Seed Alliance 2021 ). Seed sharing initiatives can then be
a form of vocal resistance against the industrialisation of the food system and the commodi ﬁcation
of seeds in some contexts, but in others they are a form of quiet activism carried out by gardeners
through simple acts of growing and sharing (Pottinger 2017 ).
In summary, existing research establishes seed sharing as a social practice that involves not only
the sharing of seeds but also the sharing of practical information about how to manage, save, andgrow them, enhancing skills and know-how. Existing research also ﬁnds that socio-ecological sus-
tainability and intergenerational justice are key drivers of seed sharing. However, the majority ofresearch on seed sharing to date has focused on low- and middle-income countries, on ruralareas and on farmers in agrarian communities. There is a knowledge gap in relation to understanding
where, how and why practices of seed sharing are occurring beyond these locations. In response, the
following section outlines the methods that were used as a means to provide a novel landscapeanalysis of urban seed sharing, with a focus on those initiatives which use ICT to mediate their
sharing practices and which as a result leave digital traces for analysis.
Methods
This paper draws its empirical data from the SHARECITY100 database, which explored a spectrum of
ICT-mediated urban food sharing activities (Davies et al. 2017a ; Davies et al. 2017b ; Davies and Legg
2018 ),1including seed sharing in 100 urban areas internationally. The database is not representative
of the distribution of urban areas globally, so it does not provide an analysis of the global geographi-cal distribution of ICT-mediated urban seed sharing, but it does show that urban seed sharing takes
place on every continent (see Table 1).
The methodological approach to identify, select, and analyse relevant seed sharing initiatives was
two-fold. First, an initial screening of the initiatives in the SHARECITY100 Database was undertaken toidentify urban seed sharing initiatives. Then, content analysis of the information provided by the
initiatives was conducted to gain deeper understanding of the practices associated with ICT-mediated seed sharing across diverse geographical locations.
Out of a total of 4,003 initiatives, 187 were found to include seed sharing in their activities. Further
analysis of the database revealed that 33 of these had a primary focus on seed sharing practices in theirmission statement or name (e.g. seed bank, seed library). The sample included initiatives that shareLOCAL ENVIRONMENT 789
seeds and use one or more forms of ICT-mediation e.g. a website, a Facebook page, and Twitter. Once
these initiatives had been identi ﬁed, their online pro ﬁles were examined systematically exploring the
“About ”,“Who We Are ”, and “What We Do ”sections where they existed. A set of codes were developed
to identify how seeds were shared and the motivations, drivers and goals of the initiatives for sharing.The collated information was used to establish the meanings, skills and understandings of seed
sharing practices in these initiatives. Following this, reference to the material mechanisms forsharing seeds (tools for brevity) were identi ﬁed and considered and ﬁnally reference to internal or
external regulations (rules) were highlighted. Nearly two-thirds of initiatives (64%) in the samplewere found to have no formal organisational structure or were associations. While some seedsharing initiatives adopted multiple forms of exchange, including sharing seeds for free and via mon-
etary transactions, 22 were sharing seeds mainly by gifting, 15 predominantly by bartering, 3 by col-
lecting and 1 by selling. The actors participating in these exchanges were not always consistently orextensively speci ﬁed in online pro ﬁles, but generally included community members such as garden-
ers, homesteaders, urban cultivators, activists, academics, and Indigenous peoples. In the majority ofcases no actors were excluded from participating in urban seed sharing initiatives, although therewere often clear rules around how, when and for what purpose sharing was permitted.
Social practices of urban ICT-mediated seed sharing
As discussed earlier in this paper, seed sharing practices comprise particular skills, understandings,tools and rules, which vary depending on the social and geographical context in which they take
place. In this section we use the same analytical lens of social practice theory to explore these dimen-
sions with respect to urban ICT-mediated seed sharing.
Skills and understandings
Analysis of seed sharing initiatives ’online mission statements provides important insights into the
skills and understandings generated by seed sharing activities. The key goal identi ﬁed amongstTable 1. Number and location of seeds sharing initiatives in the SHARECITY 100 Database (Davies et al. 2017b ).

the sample of 33 urban seed sharing initiatives relates to protecting and enhancing agrobiodiversity
in urban settings through safeguarding seed variety types. This is allied strongly with a commitmentto the right to protect, reproduce, multiply, store and preserve seeds. In particular, the preservation
of local seed diversity even in urban settings is a major motivating factor; a process that often
involves borrowing, sowing, and returning seeds after harvest. This is demonstrated by the Rich-mond Grows Seed Lending Library, as well as the Cleveland Seed Bank, both in the U.S.A., that
seek to enhance capacity building for small-scale urban agricultural communities through delivery
of information about locally adapted seeds as well as “cultivating the skills required for sustainable
food production ”(Cleveland Seed Bank 2021 ). Elsewhere in the sample, there are mission-driven
initiatives such as the non-governmental organisations Grupo Semillas (Seeds Group –semillas is
Spanish for seeds) based in Bogotá whose explicit goal is to build regional coalitions against corpor-ate GMO-focused models of seed supply. The initiative is a form of collective action against such seed
trade while promoting diversi ﬁed local food economies.
For some seed sharing initiatives, the commitment to protect native varieties of seeds from trans-
genic contamination is a form of cultural practice, where seed sharing motivates participants to seethemselves as guardians of biocultural heritage, carriers of Indigenous knowledge and as activists for
seeds without borders. This is demonstrated by La Red de Guardianes de Semillas (The Seed Guar-dians Network), an NGO based in Quito that celebrates seed sharing as an ancestral practice in
Ecuador. In European urban metropolises such as London and Berlin where ethnic diversity is
high, seed sharing initiatives such as the London Freedom Seed Bank also bring a cultural aspectto sharing through the co-production of knowledge about urban heritage, as participants celebrate
cultural diversity by sharing seeds that are native to their cultures. In Wellington, New Zealand, the
Heritage Seed Collective organises seed saver exchanges aimed at preserving the longevity of heri-tage seeds that are in danger of genetic extinction. Regardless of geographic location, the majority of
initiatives examined share a common sense of purpose related to building a more holistic view of the
food system where seeds represent the transformation of society, as exempli ﬁed in Vandana Shiva ’s
Manifestos on the Future of Food and Seed (2007 ). Indeed, this work has deeply inspired and united
seed sharing practitioners worldwide in the movement for food and democracy (Kloppenburg 2014 ).
The seed sharing initiatives ’mission statements and motivations are also linked to sustainability
actions as the majority (94%) of seed sharing initiatives in our sample seek to achieve positive
environmental impacts from their activities, more than half (61%) claim social and economic
impact and just over a third (33%) of initiatives explicitly seek to achieve all three. Social impactsare discussed in terms of new relations that are created when seeds are shared, as illustrated by
Social Seeds in Berlin and Ann Arbor Area Plant and Seed Exchange. Economic impacts are often
framed as gaining ﬁnancial autonomy for food producers to own and sell seeds that enable econ-
omic resilience in local food systems. This is demonstrated by initiatives that are aligned with
food sovereignty movements such as Red de Guardianes de Semillas in Ecuador and Mexico,
Peliti (which means “oak tree ”in Pontic/ Black Sea Greek) in Greece and the Bu ğday (Wheat) Associ-
ation in Turkey. Environmental goals include responding to biodiversity loss that threatens food and
nutrition security. For example, Grupo Semillas ( 2020 ) in their mission statement states that they
support peasant, Indigenous and Afro organisations in Colombia to preserve biodiversity and
defend their autonomy, their resources and productive systems for sustainable livelihoods. The Bota-
nical Seed Bank in Berlin and Southern Seed Exchange in Christchurch prioritise preserving wild
urban plants and heritage cultivars (e.g. seeds that are not available commercially), many ofwhich have become endangered by rapid urban growth and invasive plant species.
Translocal collaborations that comprise skills and knowledge exchange lie at the heart of all 33
urban initiatives in the sample examined. For example, Xarxa Catalana de Graners (CatalonianSeed Network), a seed sharing group in Barcelona that operates as a network of eleven sub-
groups, has been working with the National Program for the Conservation and Utilization of Plant
Genetic Resources to preserve over 400 traditional agricultural varieties and support food sover-eignty movements in Spain. Furthermore, established seed sharing initiatives whose origins are toLOCAL ENVIRONMENT 791
be found in socio-political movements against GMOs are more likely to engage in some form of
transnational collaboration. For example, Athens-based Peliti collaborates with many seed sharingorganisations in other countries, including the U.S.A., Bulgaria, Austria and Turkey, sharing knowl-
edge as well carrying out advocacy actions for sustainable rural policies. Furthermore, the Seed
Savers Network, whose activities are spread across Australia, has been delivering community seedbank training programmes and helping organisations in low- and middle-income locations to estab-
lish seed sharing networks and expertise.
Some initiatives, particularly those located in low-income and southern European countries, are
critical of the marginalisation of native knowledges and practices that they blame, as Shiva ( 2016 )
does, on commercial seed systems, and focus on the right to seeds as a motivational force for
their activities. This is exempli ﬁed by the Bu ğday Association based in Istanbul that started as a
socio-ecological movement in 1990 and since then has been involved in monitoring seed practices
and contributing to the development of national policies in Turkey, seeking to improve both seed
and community food resilience. Like the Bu ğday Association, Peliti states that “rights should be
kept by locals [farmers, peasant, communities] and not corporations” (Peliti 2021 ). Indeed, most
urban seed sharing initiatives examined aim to disrupt global corporate seed supply chains byencouraging sharing and growing from native seeds in which pollination occurs naturally (viabirds, insects, and wind) and leads to greater genetic food diversity. Sharing open-pollinated
seeds is then a political process in which initiatives co-produce democratic place-based seed
systems, where diverse actors (humans and otherwise) collectively participate in the ownership(and protection) of seeds; an act of sovereignty. The aspect of sovereignty has been articulated
by seed sharing initiatives based in Central and South America and in Southern Europe, through
their a ﬃliation with La Via Campesina movement that recognises seeds as an “irreplaceable pillar
of food production and the basis of productive, social and cultural reproduction ”(La Via Campesina
2021 ).
Tools and rules
This section focuses on the types of tools (e.g. technologies) and the rules (e.g. internal and externalgovernance rules) that guide the performance of ICT-mediated seed sharing practices in urban con-
texts. Initiatives can use multiple forms of ICT, but the vast majority (79%) of initiatives in our sample
are using a dedicated website to mediate their seed sharing (as well as sharing knowledge aboutseeds and plants), while 51% have a Facebook page and 18% have a Twitter account. ICT is
mainly utilised for (1) organising seed sharing practices (e.g. online seed sharing databases), (2)
achieving transparency within seed sharing networks (e.g. seed group membership), and (3) capacitybuilding and networking initiatives at national and global scales.
In some cases, ICT oﬀ ers an online organisational structure to allow for sound seed sharing man-
agement practices. For example, the London Freedom Seed Bank has been using their website totrack and record how seed passed from one grower to the next; how many of the seeds coming
into the bank were from London originally; and how many generations had they been grown for.
The seed database created by the initiative is interactive, with members participating in the co-pro-duction of knowledge by uploading photos and sharing information about seeds, such as cultivation
methods, that promote transparency around seed sharing practices. Similarly, initiatives such as the
Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library (U.S.A.) and the Southern Seed Exchange in Christchurch(New Zealand) use websites to create membership forms that require participants to share personal
information such as addresses. These ICT-mediated membership systems enhance transparent seed
sharing management which includes registration, labelling and background information on seedhandling (e.g. where and how to grow from seeds) and a positive seed sharing ethos as participants
are encouraged to take responsibility and become guardians of seeds.
Networking within and between seed sharing initiatives is also mediated by ICT, for example
Google Maps is frequently used by initiatives to increase their translocal and international reach792 A. R. DAVIES ET AL.
by connecting people, spaces, and organisational practices across communities and countries. Such
mapping tools have been used by the London Freedom Seed Bank, Graines de Troc (Barter Seeds,which has seed sharing hubs in France and Switzerland), and the Local Seed Network (that operates
in urban and peri-urban areas across Australia), to track interactions between seed varieties, growers
and guardians. It is also clear that ICT can play a key role in encouraging greater civic education andengagement in seed systems by strengthening skills and understandings about seed sharing prac-
tices. ICT has been used by initiatives to disseminate calls for volunteers, promote sustainable behav-
iour and educate the wider public, as many initiatives provide publications and some o ﬀer online
access to educational resources including videos and manuals. An example of this is Madre
Semilla (Mother Seed), a dedicated education platform of the Red de Guardianes de Semillas del
Ecuador that helps to raise awareness of socio-ecological issues.
Despite the diversity of urban seed sharing, all initiatives in our sample set out their rules for par-
ticipation. These internal rules are guided by collective commitment to preserve and disseminatetraditional seed varieties mentioned in the previous section. This involves a commitment from par-ticipants not to acquire, share, or support conventional seeds, seed industries or practices of genetic
seed engineering and it is visibly communicated in the mission statements of most initiatives. Fur-
thermore, some initiatives such as Red de Guardianes de Semillas del Ecuador and Bu ğday Associ-
ation go a step further by developing a participatory guarantee system, a local quality assurance
scheme for ensuring the quality, promotion and distribution of agricultural seeds based on a “foun-
dation of trust, social networks and knowledge exchange ”(IFOAM –Organics International 2019 , 3).
A number of seed sharing initiatives including Xarxa Catalana de Graners, Peliti, and Red de Guar-dianes de Semillas del Ecuador, whose work involves advocating for food sovereignty, also
support agroecological principles in seed sharing (García López et al. 2019 ).
Seed sharing initiatives are inevitably a ﬀected by external governing rules such as national and
international regulations that shape the performance of seed sharing (O ’Grady Walshe 2019 ).
Some of the most established initiatives in urban seed sharing whose mission is directed at protect-ing the autonomy of peasant communities and Indigenous peoples critically engage in the evalu-
ation of external governing rules around seed sharing. In the European context, initiatives such as
Peliti demonstrate high involvement in international seed governance debates. This is communi-cated on the initiative ’s website and a signi ﬁcant number of online publications have been published
to inﬂuence the European Commission and European Union, with recommendations for revision of
seed sharing legislation. A recent example includes a letter opposing the European legislation on theproduction and marketing of plant reproductive material including seeds (Council Decision [EU]
2019/1905) which, according to the Peliti, is limited to commercial activities, aimed at professional
seed users and does not prioritise freedom of choice for cultivators, both in terms of seeds(species, varieties, populations) and production patterns (Peliti 2021 ). Similarly, urban seed sharing
initiative Semillas de Vida (Seeds of Life) in Mexico City regularly engages in policy dialogues onseeds and food sovereignty via press releases and publications published on the initiative ’s
website, stating for example: “we urge the Government of Mexico to jointly build a new agrifood
and nutritional system-model …to remain vigilant to support the frontal warning labelling and
the prohibition of glyphosate and transgenic corn, and to continue defending national and foodsovereignty and our sacred plant: corn ”(Semillas de Vida 2021 ). In this way, urban seed sharing
initiatives are looking to shape the governance of seeds so that no law, public policy, market strategyor private appropriation may infringe the basic right to create, save, multiply, share, exchange, selland freely distribute seeds (Red de Guardianes de Semillas 2019 ).
Discussion
In this section, the results outlined above are considered in the light of the papers ’initial questions:
(a) What are the social practices of ICT-mediated urban seed sharing? and (b) What do these practicesmean for justice and sustainability?LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 793
Social practices of ICT-mediated urban seed sharing
The existing literature on seed sharing focuses largely on farmer-to-farmer seed exchange in rural
environments and it is in these rural locations that the majority of seed sharing activities take
place, since family farms produce roughly 80% of the world ’s food and occupy around 70– 80% of
farmland globally (Lowder, Sánchez, and Bertini 2021 ). However, as the previous section shows,
urban seed sharing also exists, creating possibilities for collective seed provisioning systems in
urban environments. In our sample, these urban seed sharing initiatives have predominantly beenestablished to support and preserve more sustainable livelihoods and lifestyles in which the right
to safe nutrition, the maintenance of natural diversity in urban spaces and an appreciation of
farmers ’eﬀorts to protect seeds, is key. The latter in particular is an important motivational driver
for the emergence of ICT-mediated urban based seed sharing networks (e.g. seed banks, libraries
and swaps, as well as NGOs); as a form of solidarity with rural farmers resisting corporate agribusiness
and global food supply chains that commodify food. In these seed networks, ICT plays a key role inconnecting people with seeds, with other seed sharers and with biodiverse foodscapes through new
socio-material relations.
In this paper, we show that ICT plays an important role in mediating seed sharing practices within
and beyond the initiative itself. ICT acts as a channel for communication and mobilisation, toexchange information and build expertise and resources between diﬀ erent participants. In the
process of knowledge sharing, ICT enables translocal and international seed sharing institutions
to emerge and operate. In particular, social media is a tool often used by initiatives to build aware-
ness and advocacy globally whilst also acting as place-based, capacity-building hubs that enhance
understanding of food biodiversity through social learning. On the other hand, with ICT potentiallyconnecting seed sharers in di ﬀerent locations, there are risks that need to be considered, such as the
legal and environmental implications of sharing seeds across jurisdictions and geographic scales.Further in-depth research examining online seed sharing networks could o ﬀer insights into the
opportunities and risks posed by digital seed sharing economies and solutions to overcome barriers.
Additionally, there is an opportunity to examine the extent to which the integration of online and
oﬄine interactions, combining traditional practices and new technologies, may build resilience (Eys-
sartier, Ladio, and Lozada 2013 ).
The role of seed sharing in just transitions to sustainability
Using a social practice lens, it is possible to identify the relational agency of seeds as necessaryactants in the process of co-producing more just urban food systems across multiple-scales andlevels of participation. Seeds, with their symbolic and material agency, have the potential to cross
disciplinary boundaries of knowledge (e.g. agriculture, biodiversity conservation) as they circulate
between farming communities, urban spaces, homes, and research institutions, and as such theycontribute to a collective agency for more just urban food systems through a network of inter-
relationships that come into existence when seeds and seed related knowledge and skills are
shared. Translocal and transnational reach of urban seed sharing initiatives as well as growingfood from shared seeds at urban and peri-urban levels demonstrates this. Also, as indicated by
the sample of seed sharing initiatives analysed, urban seed sharing incorporates a multitude of
issues, from addressing power inequalities and sustaining traditional techniques, to biodiversity con-servation approaches for sustainable food systems and seed activism (Peschard and Randeria 2019 ).
Although, as shown elsewhere, community seed sharing networks contain their own social and pol-itical norms, structures and inequalities (Coomes et al. 2015 ).
In opposing technocratic discourses around food security that criminalise ancestral seed sharing
practices, urban seed sharing initiatives also emphasise more-than-human solidarities throughnotions of seed stewardship, thus placing justice at the centre of sustainable food transitions (Tor-naghi and Dehaene 2020 ). In fact, acknowledging that the processes of urbanisation are destructive794 A. R. DAVIES ET AL.
to biodiversity, seed sharing initiatives create a form of bio-cultural refugia; places that shelter bio-
diversity and where rituals and cultural memories are stored, revived and “carried forward between
people and across cohorts ”(Barthel, Crumley, and Svedin 2013 , 1142). Previous research has already
found that such places play an important role in resilience building in times of shocks (idem, 1144).
The majority of the urban initiatives we examined are committed to enhancing transparency and
trust of and around seeds through a process of commoning (Bollier and Helfrich 2015 ); a joint action
of creating things together and cooperating to meet shared goals of justice and sustainability inrelation to seeds speciﬁ cally, but also food more generally. While practical aspects of transparency
and trust in seed commoning are re ﬂected in how seeds are exchanged, documented, stored,
and rejuvenated to preserve their biological diversity, there is also an intangible value embeddedwithin the processes of sharing. While imperfect, and often fragile, sharing seeds between strangersin these urban initiatives creates complex, holistic interacting systems of meanings and relationships
in which care is elevated (Puig De La Bellacasa 2015 ) and built into seed sharing relations. In particu-
lar, protection of open pollinators through seed sharing has become a pre ﬁgurative practice, a
“matter of concern” (Latour 2005 , 6) for demonstrating the possibilities for just and sustainable
food transitions. Linked to this is a collective commitment to recon ﬁguring the rules governing
access to genetic resources that seeds represent to place justice at the forefront; justice for
people, plants and the planet.
Conclusion
In the midst of an unsustainable global food system dominated by commercial and corporate actors,practices of non-commercial seed sharing initiatives, both urban and otherwise, provide actuallyexisting demonstrations of doing things di ﬀerently. While research attention to date has been pre-
dominantly focused on rural manifestations of seed sharing as alternative practice, this paper setsout an emerging landscape of urban-based ICT-mediated seed sharing initiatives. ICT mediationallows for alternative means of connecting and communicating about seed sharing (e.g. sharing
skills and understandings), providing new “tools ”which can reach far greater audiences at unparal-
leled speeds compared to analogue means of communication. Given the focus of the initiatives on
sustainability and justice it can be inferred that ICT, therefore, speeds up organising about, and advo-
cating for, appropriate governance of seeds and their exchange, but only for those who have access
to ICT mechanisms themselves. Careful attention to persistent digital divides in populations isneeded when conducting the further empirical and ethnographic research that is required to under-
stand on a more granular level both the nature of the individual actors who participate in urban seed
sharing and why, and the impacts that seed sharing using ICT creates for them and for justice andsustainability. Additional research that explicitly interrogates the role of ICT-mediation in rural seed
sharing would also facilitate comparative analysis between urban and rural seed sharing initiatives.
Using a social practice lens, we have been able to consider and outline the rules, tools, skills and
understandings that are shaping seed sharing initiatives and compare them to their non-urbancounterparts. Seed sharing practices, whether urban or rural, are seeking to preserve genetic diver-
sity of seeds while at the same time addressing challenges that cut across a multitude of issues andscales of action, including that of power and representation in sustaining longevity of community
seed sharing systems, traditions and resources. It is found that urban seed sharing initiatives demon-
strate broad similarities to their non-urban counterparts with concerns about justice and biodiversityprotection, but place more emphasis on enhancing bio-cultural diversity in urban food systems and
practices of urban commoning.
The social practice lens adopted was particularly useful in illuminating multifaceted elements and
linkages underlying seed sharing, identifying the intersection of on- and o ﬀ-line activities within
urban contexts and their links to similar activities beyond the urban. However, as yet there has
been limited analysis of the extent to which these urban seed sharing activities are achievingtheir goals, in part because of the lack of impact reporting by these initiatives. In this regard,LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 795
recent developments in sustainability impact assessment speci ﬁcally designed with food sharing in
mind (see Mackenzie and Davies 2019 ) could be productively employed to explore successes and
failures, as well as challenges and opportunities for urban ICT-mediated seed sharing for more
just transitions to sustainable urban food systems.

remove inactive initiatives up until 2020, and to identify changes in ICT proﬁ les, no new searches have been
added to the database. It therefore represents only a snapshot of the current seed sharing landscape.
