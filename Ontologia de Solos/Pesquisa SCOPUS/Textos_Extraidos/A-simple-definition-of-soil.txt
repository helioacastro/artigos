Soil ABSTRACT  
This paper presents a simpler definition of soil that reflects three aspects: ontology (what), epistemology (how), 
and axiology (value), which are related to the construction of the definition. Soil is the loose mineral or organic 
material comprising three phases solid, liquid, and, gaseous, found on the surface of the earth (ontology), 
resulting from weathering processes through interactions of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and 
biosphere (epistemology) serving as a habitat for micro and macro-organisms, plants, and animals, and ulti-
mately supporting human life and civilization (axiology). This simple definition brings more attention to human 
soil interactions and build sustainable solutions for soil and civilization in the future.   
A short article, ‘Define soil’ by McBratney and Hartemink published 
in the Soil Security Journal in March 2024 has offered a new paradigm in 
soil science. This article seemed to be the culmination of discourse about 
the future of soil science in papers entitled ’The future of soil science ’ 
and ’A soil science renaissance ’ (Hartemink, 2006 ; Hartemink and 
McBratney, 2008 ). For decades, soil science has primarily served the 
field of agriculture, as evidenced by the myriad definitions of soil since 
the early 1800s and expressed in two modern soil classification systems 
(van Es, 2017 ; Hartemink, 2016 ; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2022 ; Soil 
Survey Staff, 2022 ), even though many soil scientists realized that soil 
science served a broader scientific discipline. 
The soil science community holds wide views on soils. They have 
been defined as: a three phase system by soil physicists; reactors of 
chemical properties and composition by soil chemists; stores and 
transformers of plant nutrients by soil fertility specialists; buffers and 
filters of water by hydropedologists; a natural resource that degrades 
and under threat by environmental soil scientists; a medium for small 
fauna by micriobiologists and soil biologists; a storage tank and trans -
former for organics and inorganics by biogeochemists; a functional 
element in ecosystem services by ecological soil scientists; an element of 
the landscape by soil geomorphologists; objects of individual study by 
most pedologists; soil as a natural capital by ecological economists; soil 
as a building material by engineers; soil as an forgotten, unseen and 
underfoot element (by pedo pessimists) (Hartemink, 2016 ). 
In an anthropogenic era marked by ecological destruction and linked 
societal crises, soil has emerged as the hidden foundation for resolving 
these crises. Soil, often overlooked, has become recognized as a crucial issue, evolving into soil security, which underpins five vital aspects of 
human civilization: food security, water security, climate change miti-
gation, biodiversity protection, ecosystem service delivery, and energy 
sustainability (Koch et al., 2013 ). Soil scientists may bring more atten -
tion to human-soil interactions and build sustainable solutions for soil in 
the future (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020 ). 
McBratney and Hartemink proposed two definitions of soil one 
shorter and one longer single-sentence definitions. Soil, in the shorter 
definition, is ‘the layered material at the earth ’s surface, which has 
resulted from chemical and biological processes and physical organisa -
tion of minerals and organic matter, and which supports terrestrial 
ecosystems and humanity. Meanwhile, soil in the longer definition is 
’the horizonated mixed solid, liquid and gaseous material at the earth ’s 
surface, resulting from chemical and biological processes and physical 
organisation of minerals and organic matter which interacts with the 
atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere, and which operates within, 
and supports, terrestrial ecosystems including biodiversity, plants, ani-
mals, and humanity. The authors also requested that others create and 
share concise definitions also in a single sentence in order to achieve 
ultimately general consensus, acceptance, understanding and use 
(McBratney and Hartemink, 2024 ). 
The definitions of soil can be framed in different ways, and an 
attempt is made to unravel the basis of these definitions based on what 
soils are, how they are formed, and how the definitions differ for 
different groups of soil scientists. There are approximately six aspects of 
soil that determines its definition: 1) material (organic, inorganic, clay, 
sand, etc.); 2) composition (threephase system: solid, liquid, gas); 3)

2origin (broken-down rocks, geology, diluvium, alluvium, etc.); 4) 
behaviour (dynamics, changes over time); 5) medium for properties and 
processes (carbon storage, water filtration); 6) functions (biomass pro-
duction, carbon pool, building material) (Hartemink, 2016). However, 
creating a simple definition with detailed information on six aspects in a 
single sentence is complicated and difficult to understand, especially for 
the public. 
Here we present a simpler definition of soil which reflects three as-
pects: ontology (what), epistemology (how), and axiology (value), and 
which are related to the construction of the definition. Science, both 
natural science and social science, has three components as pillars 
supporting the body of knowledge, namely ontology, epistemology and 
axiology. In short, ontology is about the what question (Smith, 2022), 
epistemology is about the how question (Wenning, 2009), and axiology 
is about the value question (Hart, 1971). A simple definition should be 
capable of summarizing a wide range of perspectives from soil scientists, 
and it should be able to explain at least three aspects of the pillars of 
knowledge as outlined in this paper. The sentence structure of the 
definition may vary, but it should still encompass ontology, episte -
mology, and axiology, either sequentially or non-sequentially. 
Based on three above pillars, soil is the loose mineral or organic 
material comprising three phases solid, liquid, and, gaseous, found on 
the surface of the earth (ontology), resulting from weathering processes 
through interactions of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and 
biosphere (epistemology) serving as a habitat for micro and macro- 
organisms, plants, and animals, and ultimately supporting human life 
and civilization (axiology). 
Therefore, the definition of soil is ‘the loose mineral or organic ma-
terial comprising three phases solid, liquid, and gaseous, found on the 
surface of the earth, resulting from weathering processes through in-
teractions of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere 
serving as a habitat for micro and macro-organisms, plants, and animals, 
and ultimately supporting human life and civilization.’ 
In the author’s opinion, the phrase ‘…resulting from weathering 
processes through interactions of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydro -
sphere, and biosphere…’ implicit describes the soil formation process, 
which is the basis of the soil science discipline according to Dokuchaev 
and Jenny. The term ’processes’ implies the time factor (t) during 
weathering by climate (cl), organisms (o), and relief (r). Meanwhile, the 
distinction between mineral and organic refers to the parent material (p) 
as well as the final form, whether mineral soil or organic soil. This 
definition also emphasizes the value of soil, which not only medium for 
growth of plants but also serves as a habitat for micro and macro- 
organisms, plants and animals, and supports human life and civilization. 
Certainly, the simple definition above can be expanded into three 
definitions of soils based on three aspects, providing more detailed in-
formation. In this paper,the authors have attempted to offer some op-
tions about it. First, the definition of soil in being or ontology is a natural 
body of loose mineral and organic materials comprising three pha-
ses—solid, liquid, and gaseous—found on the surface of the earth, 
differentiated into horizons of variable depth, differing from the mate-
rial below in morphology, physical, chemical, and biological 
characteristics. 
Secondly, the definition of soil in process or epistemology is product 
of weathering and reorganization of the earth’s surface material such as 
rock, plant and animal residue, through interactions of the lithosphere, 
atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere with unique physical, chemi -
cal, and biological process. Thirdly, the definition of soil in value or axiology is the skin of the 
earth, serving as a habitat for micro and macro-organisms within its 
layers, plants and animals above its surface, and ultimately supporting 
human life and civilization. 
We have attempted to create this simple definition to support soil 
security for better soil policy in the future (Koch et al., 2013) and to be 
adequate for bringing more attention to human-soil interactions and 
building sustainable solutions for soil in the future. However, improved 
definitions may continue to evolve dynamically, keeping pace with ad-
vancements in soil science and the evolving needs of society concerning 
soil.
