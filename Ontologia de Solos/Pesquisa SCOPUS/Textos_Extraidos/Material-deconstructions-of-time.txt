The topic of time and how it can be unpacked, deconstructed and designed with is fundamental to HCI, but
it is also extensively engaged within artistic practice. By analysing a selection of ten media artworks, all
in different ways concerned with time and temporality, we explore how artists approach these matters as
culturally and politically loaded. The selected projects align with the ongoing scholarly interest in alternatives
to common perceptions on time, unmaking the normative clock time and the posthuman discourse. Following
an analysis of the theoretical and material expressions of these artworks, we conceptualised four themes
through which unmaking was represented: dissecting temporality ,the unmaking of the singular ,unmaking
as messing up andunmaking the other . We close with a discussion on how these themes intersect with the
current discourse on unmaking in HCI and reflect on challenges and opportunities for design and theory.

1 Introduction
Withinhuman–computer interaction (HCI) , time is an implicit component of how interaction
is experienced and materially played out [Wiberg and Stolterman, 2021], as well as how it is
continuously reconfigured, unmade and abandoned. Vallgårda [ 2014] highlighted temporal form as
one of three key dimensions of interaction design. Similarly, Fuchsberger et al. [ 2015] presented
seven sensitivities that address the effect of time in interaction design. As stated by Odom et al.
[2022], “[t]ime is the medium through which an interactive dialog between a human and computer
begins, unfolds, and resolves ”. Time is also a defining component in today’s digitally mediated
societies. These societies are immediate and quick, with multiple changes occurring that we become
accustomed to or resist, which is currently determined by the transition on social media from
displaying chronological content towards displaying content sorted by personalised algorithms.

Temporality is further amplified by technologies that demand always-on, always-connected and
always-available living.
Nonetheless, time within HCI has exhibited a shift from a focus on clock time, which is knotted
with the time of the machine, to investigating dimensions of time as an existential concern, as
socially constructed and as a cultural phenomenon [Rapp et al., 2022]. We have also seen recent
developments that involve investigating time as a multifaceted phenomenon [Rapp et al., 2022],
entangledwithininteractionsbetweenhumanandnonhumantimescales,i.e.,cultural,technological
and interpersonal timescales on the one hand, and astronomical, geological and environmental
scales on the other [Ciobanu and Juhlin, 2022, Ikeya and Barati, 2023, Lee et al., 2019]. These
works may be regarded as posthumanist interventions, as they cultivate an understanding of time
and, by association, an understanding of the world from a heterogeneous and plural perspective.
Moving from focusing on efficiency and progress to understanding time as collective, entangled
and more-than-human is also a question that concerns sustainability. Temporality and our impact
on, e.g., future generations, is fundamental in aspects related to the environmental crisis, which is
a major concern within sustainableHCI(SHCI) [Hansson et al., 2021]. Time is also central in
shifting the question of sustainability from one of compromise and “ personal morality ” [Dourish,
2010] to “asking what regenerative and respectful co-living looks like ” [Light, 2022]. Within this area,
nonanthropocentric HCI works to unpack further the complex entanglements that form between
species [Liu, 2020]. In this paper, we regard the above concerns as fundamentally engaging with a
cultureintheprocessofunmakingconventionalnotionsofhowtimeisrepresentedandunderstood.
The role of unmaking is not only seen in conceptions of time but is also diversely present in
sustainable design agendas that are often theoretically grounded in feminist new materialism
[Barad,2007, Hayles, 1999]. The discourse on unmaking is also central to what is sometimes called
multispeciesjustice [Celermajeretal., 2021],e.g.,in unmasking anthropocentricnarrativesthatapply
practices based on oversight, such as in de-extinction experiments [Ibbotson, 2017]. Nevertheless,
considered creative processes as of recently, processes of breakdown allow for other things to
“add value, character, function, aesthetics, and sustainability into design ” [Liu et al., 2019]. Design
researchers have engaged with unmaking in various ways [Lindström and Ståhl, 2020; Sabie et al.,
2022a,b; Song and Paulos, 2021; Tonkinwise, 2013], further proposing concepts such as un-crafting
[Murer et al., 2015], unfabricating [Wu and Devendorf, 2020], design away [Tonkinwise, 2013],
forgetting as unknowing in data work practices [Muller and Strohmayer, 2022], unravelling and
mending as embodied thinking practices constructed by care [Pérez-Bustos, 2017], undesigning
[Pierce, 2012] and unmaking as emancipation for social justice issues [Sabie et al., 2023]. As it lacks
a normative definition, we follow Sabie et al.’s [ 2023] understanding of unmaking as “ modes of
thinking, articulation, and action that take on an issue primarily by taking away, taking apart, and/or
taking down (including to the point of intelligibility) what currently exists ”.
Factoring the role of unmaking into the entanglements between environmental disruptions,
time and HCI and considering how HCI has fairly recently begun to investigate posthumanist
perspectives on time [Ciobanu and Juhlin, 2022; Ikeya and Barati, 2023;Bell et al., 2024], we turn
to works in new media art for our investigation. Artists have progressively engaged with the
interdisciplinary field of feminist new materialism [Mondloch, 2018a] and employ a variety of
creative approaches that can address challenges of posthuman and temporal natures. We thus take
as a case study a selection of ten artistic projects that vary in terms of scale and representation (see
Figure1) and were conducted by different artists or collectives. We explore these artworks with
unmaking as the analytical framework to unpack the theoretical underpinnings and intellectual
concerns they engage with through their material manifestations. Through this work, we make the
following contributions to calls within HCI concerning unmaking and posthumanist outlooks on
time.First,toconceptualisewhatweinterpretasmaterialattemptsatdeconstructinghuman-centred

notions of time, we start by surveying the potential of investigating artistic practice from within
HCI research. Second, we present an exploration of the knowledge produced by the ten selected
artworks, unpacking these in terms of unmaking through four distinct themes. The works present a
deconstruction of established notions of time, making space for new worldviews and emphasising
entanglements and ways of cultivating relations. In this article, we use the notion of material
deconstructions to relay how the conceptual deconstruction of time can be physically expressed. We
understand deconstruction as the “ taking apart of what has been made—disassembling assemblages,
unbuilding constructions, and dissecting structures ” [Sjoberg, 2024]. Through deconstruction, we
consciously investigate the parts that form a whole without taking anything away, though some
parts might get broken during the process. Namely, while deconstructing the conventional idea
of human clock time, the artworks still include this temporal form among its other temporalities,
thus keeping this aspect of time rather than removing it. While unmaking and deconstruction
are synonymous and can be similarly understood, both standing as opposites to making and

constructing, respectively, we acknowledge that subtle differences exist. We acknowledge the
discussion on how unmaking is discussed, understood and applied in HCI and what terms are
related [see Song et al., 2024]. In this article, however, we disengage from discussing the semantic
differences between these notions and other related concepts that we use, including dissecting, to
instead focus on the various material and conceptual ways the artworks are presented and how
diversely they engage with the discourse on unmaking.
2 Background
In the following section, we will present background information on approaches and bodies of
work on unmaking in HCI and its connection to sustainability, and we will describe the connections
between art and HCI, how HCI has engaged with posthumanism, and the ties between media art
and these various topics.
The concept of unmaking has gained increased interest in HCI, as highlighted, for instance, by
theUnmaking@CHI workshop in April 2022 [Sabie et al., 2022b]. Sabie et al. divide the approaches
to unmaking in HCI into five categories. First, unmaking as an inevitable occurrence includes
works that deal with immanent processes of the breakdown, obsolescence and decay of designed
things, specifically infrastructures [Jackson, 2016] and buildings [Cairns and Jacobs, 2014]. Second,
unmaking as a sustainment agent showcases the often unrecognised key role of unmaking in design
and in sustaining life [Fry, 2003]. Third, unmaking as elimination for good is based on the idea
ofelimination design , which critically investigates the complex harmful effects of the multitude
of artefacts [Fry, 2008], with strategies being proposed for the disposal of things [Tonkinwise,
2013], orundesigning as a series of negotiation strategies for HCI [Pierce, 2012]. Fourth, unmaking
as resistance is represented by works in HCI that, for example, engage with critical unmaking,
which can unravel tensions in an intergenerational urban context that normative design strategies
cannot [Sabie et al., 2022a], or a call to action for designers to create friction, through an example
concerning designing infrastructures of civic engagement [Korn and Voida, 2015]. Lastly, the
category of unmaking as material innovation presents material exploratory works that investigate
unmaking within digital fabrication [Song and Paulos, 2021] or un-crafting computational things
and the insights gained from the process [Murer et al., 2015].
Unmaking is also tied to sustainability through the degrowth movement, making space for
alternativesthatare“ incompatiblewithmoderncapitalistsocioecologicalconfigurations ”[Feola, 2019],
sinceitraisesconcernsrelatedtoanoverabundanceofthingsandapushtowardsinnovation,which
consequently implies more artefacts, waste and pollution. Some works, such as Liu et al. [ 2019], put
forthdecompositionasacreativeapproachtowardsdesignstrategies.Similarly,LindströmandStåhl
[2020]dealwithunmakingmattersinthe aftermath ofdesignbycompostingplasticwasteandusing
plants for phytoremediation, i.e. using plants to clean polluted environments. Furthermore, they
explore un/making through design as a response to critical environmental challenges by considering
the case of the plastic straw and concerns about its disposal [Lindström and Ståhl, 2023]. Others
propose unfabricating , which addresses concerns regarding sustainability and waste in future smart
textile development [Wu and Devendorf, 2020]. An unmaking of products is depicted by Song et al.
[2022], who present the design of an interactive system made of entirely decomposable materials,
and dissolving as a design opportunity is presented in Lazaro Vasquez et al. [ 2022]. Fernaeus and
Lindegren [ 2023] conceptualise the above in terms of “ post-industrial aesthetics ” of interaction,
captured as an ongoing unmaking, or breakdown, of the modern design ideals.
Art is one of the main modalities through which human culture is mediated, and by engaging
with the arts, we “ question human behavior and create awareness of the world around us ” [Oxman,
2016]. HCI and art share the practice of making things, and many art forms are either made from or
expressedthroughinteractivetechnology[Jacobsetal., 2016;Lewisetal., 2023].Inparticular, media

artsare constantly engaging with new technologies that pervade our contemporary life [Peppler,
2010], as exemplified by the artworks chosen for this study, e.g., the use of AI in Allochronic Cycles ,
AR inPranatamangsa AR , or the ubiquitous smartphone in Deep Time Walk . However, while HCI
research implies established procedures, formalisation and generalisation, artistic work typically
opposes these particularities, and artistic projects studied within HCI have been criticised for
instrumentalising the art practice as either “ an object of analysis or as a tool for other ends ” [Britton
et al.,2019]. Meanwhile, artistic practice can be argued to hold a unique position for engaging
critically with complex concepts in ways that might not be welcome or possible through more
conventional research approaches. An example is Jacobsson et al.’s [ 2013] analysis of the works and
concerns of Artbot artists, highlighting fundamental criticism of much relevance to the broader
field of human–robot interaction. We also see the conceptual influence of art in HCI through the
evolution of the field’s focus, which evolved from first-wave HCI research on tasks, usability, and
productivity to investigations of experience and engagement, the so-called third wave of HCI
[Bødker, 2006; Harrison et al., 2007]. There is thus a move from a focus on the interface to a focus
on the “ human experience and how the design of the behaviour of the system influences it ” [Edmonds,
2018, p. 55]. The current interest in posthuman theory in HCI, sometimes referred to as fourth-wave
HCI [Ashby et al., 2019; Bardzell et al., 2021; Frauenberger, 2019; Homewood et al., 2021], also has
its reflection in topics explored in the art scene.
Posthuman theory is a result of the transdisciplinary discourse between posthumanism, which
is concerned with deconstructing normative representations of ‘the human’, and post-
anthropocentrism, which opposes the hierarchical organisation of our ecosystem that has
humans at the centre [Braidotti and Hlavajova, 2018]. As a concept that stems from the posthuman,
the more-than-human is concerned with human conditions entangled with other living beings,
materiality, technology and the environment. In HCI, investigating such entanglements has come
into focus [e.g., Frauenberger, 2019; Wakkary, 2021], and this has been proposed as constituting
a ‘fourth wave’ of HCI. These theories build upon previous works such as animal–computer interac-
tion[Mancini et al., 2017],multispecies interaction design [Gatto and McCardle, 2019; Mancini and
Lehtonen, 2018; Metcalfe, 2015],posthuman interaction design [Liu,2020],more-than-human-centred
design[Poikolainen Rosén, 2022], orplant–computer interaction [Aspling et al., 2016]. These align
with nonanthropocentric HCI research [Forlano, 2016; Smith et al., 2017], applying theories such as
natureculture [Liu et al., 2018] or the arts of noticing [Rosén et al., 2022]. Likewise, HCI fundamen-
tally also involves nonhuman things like technology [Coulton and Lindley, 2019; Giaccardi and
Redström, 2020]. The increase in these perspectives over the last decade has culminated in discus-
sions on how HCI can turn towards more-than-human perspectives [Yoo et al., 2023], suggesting
a paradigm shift within HCI and the human-centred design approach [Coskun et al., 2022].
Within art, Patricia Piccinini’s artwork We Are Family , exhibited at the 2003 Venice Biennale, is
an example of breaking away from ideas of human exceptionalism by acknowledging nonhuman
transgenic creatures [Mondloch, 2018b]. Contemporary art typically engages conceptually with
topics of interest in its surrounding culture, creating “ works that challenge our assumptions and,
in doing so, ask fundamental questions of us as human beings ” [Edmonds, 2018, p. 63]. Following
Sabie et al.’s [ 2022b] five categorisations of unmaking, the category of unmaking as resistance is
described by the works of various artists that challenge or bring attention to specific issues, such
asAuto-Destructive Art , which brings into public discourse issues of nuclear power, pollution and
capitalist systems [Wilson, 2008], orBeautiful Trouble , a collection of creative engagements from
grassroots groups, artists and activists [Boyd and Mitchell, 2012]. Artists are also increasingly
engaging with environmental questions [Galafassi et al., 2018]. According to Giannachi [ 2012],
one common strategy in these works is interventions , which aspire to encourage reflection or
behavioural change by challenging dominant ways of living. Other strategies outlined include

representations , with a focus on visualisations and communication and performance environments ,
with a focus on performance and experience. This shows a shift in the field from works that attest
to climate change [Bloom and Glasberg, 2012] to works that encourage action, finding ways to
present “ the rendering of something occurring over time, often in remote environments, to diverse and
distributed audiences ” [Giannachi, 2012]. Temporality is invaluable in understanding the scientific
data related to environmental disruptions, but most importantly, it is critical to finding patterns
that unfold over time. In this regard, investigating the changes in a situated context requires a
range of practices that artists have developed to look “ at a particular phenomenon both in the here
and now and over time ” [Giannachi, 2012].
3 Time as a Concern for HCI
HCI has a rich history of exhibiting the multiplicity of time through investigations such as the
Printer Clock ,TimeBots ,Family Clock and the Long Living Chair , all by Larissa Pschetz and her col-
leagues[Pschetz, 2015;PschetzandBanks, 2013;PschetzandBastian, 2018].Otherexamplesinclude
theworkofWillOdomandhiscolleaguesonlonger-termtemporality,asexpressedin OllyandSlow
Game[Odom et al., 2018], thePhotobox [Odom et al., 2014] andCapra[Odom et al., 2024]. Among
more utilitarian concerns are bodies of work that investigate uncertainty in digital scheduling tools
through HAZE[Bowler et al., 2022] and combine time and space through the Whereabouts Clock
[Brown et al., 2007]. A continuously reoccurring concept within HCI is clock time , or time as a mea-
surableentity,definedasaseriesoflineareventsthatarequantifiable,measurableandrational.This
understanding of time has developed alongside various timekeeping technologies [Lindley, 2015]
and is commonly symbolised by a clock. It has thus been used simultaneously as a design material,
methodologicalapproachandtheoreticallensforadvancingresearch[WibergandStolterman, 2021].
Artefacts presenting clock time, such as clocks and calendars, help structure and organise human
lifeandexperience.Researchers,however,havebeenchallengingtheseperspectivesbyexposingthe
temporal inequities and exclusion of certain communities assisted by clock time technologies [Maz-
manian and Erickson, 2014; Taylor et al., 2017], focusing instead on the subjective felt experience
of time [Pschetz and Bastian, 2018] and slow designs to counteract digitally mediated fast-paced
interactions [Hallnäs and Redström, 2001; Odom et al., 2012,2022; Strauss and Fuad-Luke, 2008].
Another characteristic of time is that it is subjectively felt, shaped by the perception that not all
changes are equally experienced [Bastian, 2012]. Similar to how significant events like a global
pandemic can distort our sense of time, affecting our sense of rhythm, digital technologies can
fabricatethesubjectiveexperienceoftimethroughtheirdesignandusagepatterns.Thisisillustrated
by concepts such as plastic time presented by Rattenbury et al. [ 2008]. The concept refers to “ empty
time spaces ” that occur when using certain types of technology, e.g., the mindless social media
scrolling [Yildiz and Coşkun, 2020].Digital time is another such concept explored by Tomlinson
[2007] and Rushkoff [ 2014] that emphasises constant connectivity and the demand for immediacy
in our interactions with digital technologies [Lindley, 2015]. In opposition to this, researchers
have presented work in the realm of slow technologies [Odom et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019], with
alternative ways of representing [Yildiz and Coşkun, 2020] and perceiving [Loup et al., 2017] time.
Other examples include the interactive artefacts designed from the perspective of Wabi-Sabi, which
enfolds the realities of nothing lasts ,nothing is finished andnothing is perfect , challenging the
expectations of timeless perfection, longevity and endurance embraced by physical interaction
design [Tsaknaki and Fernaeus, 2016].
Time has also been explored as a fundamental aspect in social relations. Thus, “ it is not that
we have or do not have time, but that we make it through practices ” [Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015].
In this sense, methods of measuring time should focus on the aspect of change rather than
the passing of time, also considering the agency flow between human and nonhuman actors
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:7
[Bastian, 2009; Greenhouse, 1996]. Various temporal aspects within social dynamics, i.e., right time
andcollective time [Yildiz and Coşkun, 2020], have been proposed within design research. Taylor
et al. [2017] present the right time or the situational when as situations that occur under certain
“converging circumstances ”, while Lindley [ 2015] examine collective time as a play in which various
actors coordinate and operate in entangled relations.
Each of the developed perspectives on time is valuable and deserves space for consideration
within different scales, both temporal and contextual. However, a perspective that remains a
challenge in HCI and calls for more investigation is the posthumanist outlook on time. The recent
interest in HCI on this topic [Oktay et al., 2023; Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022] indicates the need
for more engagement with creative practices to address this challenge. In this paper, we explore a
family of contemporary media artworks recently exhibited in different settings by different artists
or artist collectives, which all, in different ways, present a posthumanist intervention of time. We
aim to bring to light the intellectual concerns these works engage with, how these concerns are
materially manifested, and what these explorations might bring back to the academic discourse of
unmaking in HCI.
4 Research Approach
With the emergence of digital, interactive and mixed-reality art, the contrast between the practices
within the disciplines is increasingly blurred [Jacobs et al., 2015]. Whether an artefact or artwork
is investigated from an HCI or art standpoint, it is conceptually, socially and politically relevant. It
involvesunderstandingthevalueoftheartefactorartworkanditspotentialtoencouragechangefor
one’s work, field or community. Considering that a posthumanist perspective on time is in its early
stages in HCI but already has an array of work in the field of art, we take on contemporary media
artworks to investigate the following questions: What theoretical underpinnings and intellectual
concerns do these works engage with, and how are they materially manifested? How can these works
be seen to unmake time within this discourse, and what are the particular ways that unmaking takes
form?As exemplified by the artworks, they present a blend of materialities and digital, analogue,
tangible and temporal theories that we consider relevant for posthuman HCI and its contemporary
engagementwithtime.Theselectedartworksarefairlyrecent,from2011onwards.Even Longplayer ,
which started on the cusp of the new millenium, is still ongoing.
In the following, we will explore the various forms of knowledge produced by contemporary
media artworks concerned with representations of time, using the lens of new materialist philoso-
phies around unmaking in HCI, further developing previous research into the topic of time and the
posthuman discourse [Ciobanu and Juhlin, 2022]. Several of these artworks were briefly mentioned
in this previous research to showcase related work within artistic practice and used as inspiration
for conceptualising a prototype that engages with nature time [Ciobanu and Juhlin, 2022]. In this
work, however, we expand that pool of artworks to ten projects to perform a critical analysis
through the perspective of unmaking. We focus on a collection of works that explore notions of
timeinmore-than-humanassemblages,redefiningtheobjectiveandlinearideasoftimethatgovern
human social living through representations that reconnect humans to nature. We focus on this
particular case, as we consider it a part of the overarching theme of sustainability, and considering
that artworks have an increasing role in engaging the public with sustainability issues, these ideas
are particularly relevant for growing the reach of SHCI [Jacobs et al., 2013]. In this case, we find it
important to clarify that while nature is a challenging term, we follow the definition in Giannachi
[2012], where nature is considered “ as both the environment in which we live and a complex cultural
construction, including its data and genetically and technologically modified ‘natures’ ”. In this case,
we also find Alaimo’s term trans-corporeality to be relevant, as it delineates that “ there can be no
‘nature’ outside the human ” [Alaimo, 2018]. This feminist posthumanist concept steps away from
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
80:8 P.Ciobanu and Y.Fernaeus
a dualistic view of nature and culture and reflects the “ entangled ethical and political relations ”
[Alaimo, 2018] that humans and nonhumans coexist in. As stated by Brenda Laurel on the proposed
notion of Gaian IxD [Laurel, 2011], all design work should be grounded in an awareness that we
belong to the biosphere, in which “ Technology is not the other ” and “Nature is not the other .”
We started the process of gathering artworks by reading the paper abstracts in “ The Material Life
of Time”, the second international temporal belongings conference [Temporal Belongings, 2021],
which was an interdisciplinary event with roots in the arts and humanities. We then continued our
search through snowballing by looking into the authors of the papers, exploring their work, finding
other examples close to the topic, and then starting the process anew until we found sufficient cases
to analyse. The conference proved to be a productive starting point, as it tackled the topic from
various perspectives, including philosophy. Ten of the fifteen found cases were chosen for more
thorough analysis (see Figure 1). The excluded projects were omitted partly because of conceptual
overlap with other projects and partly to set a realistic limit to the analysis. This was the case for
teamLab’s Digitized Kairakuen Garden exhibition [teamLab, 2022]; while it is relevant, it presented
quite similar insights to the A Forest Where Gods Live exhibition, which is part of our selection of
artworks. In like manner, Circa[Hunt,2019] presented similar representations of natural timescales
toThe Present [Thrift,2022], such as the The Present - Moon , but in an app format. Other excluded
projects are the Artificial Biological Clock [Cohen, 2008] andVixen™ Circadian Stopwatch System
[Park,2012], both intriguing examples of human-centred bodies of work on time, and The Clock
of the Long Now [Foundation, 1999], a long-term project that engages with the notion of deep
time, with a focus on the far future. We also chose to include Deep Time Walk andThe Present ,
despite leaning more towards interaction design products. For Deep Time Walk , we consider the
project a contemporary media artwork due to its use of the modern smartphone. Additionally, as
described by the art director of the app, Fred Adam, this work is the result of connecting art and
science [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a]. As for The Present , defined as a “ functional work of art ”, the
project was created using state-of-the-art machinery, such as UV printers [The Present, 2023b] and
a programmed “ first-of-its-kind clock movement ” [The Present, 2023a]. Beyond these, we are aware
of many other well-known works on the topic. The final ten projects complied with the following
inclusion criteria: (1) the project deals with alternative more-than-human representations of time,
(2) the project has a technical component, (3) there is enough information to be able to analyse the
artwork and interaction and (4) the project is presented and referred to as an artwork.
We started the analysis of the ten selected projects by gathering relevant information on each
artwork,startingfromtheartist’swebpage,wheretheworkwaspresentedthroughotherresources,
such as media reports and academic articles, where experts and scholars have provided their per-
spectives.WethencategorisedthecollecteddatabasedonthesevencriterialistedinBardzell[ 2011],
which focus on identifying the emotional, intellectual and material qualities of the work, combined
with our own experiences and interpretations, what others have written, and how they compare to
similar projects and contextualising and pinpointing the temporal theories that are specific to the
work. Bardzell transmutes this mingling of subjective and non-perspectival dimensions to criticism
inthefieldofinteractiondesignbypresentingfourcriticalperspectives:user,design,interactionand
context. As explained by Bardzell [ 2009], taking these critical perspectives is cumulative towards
“exposing and exploring alternative assumptions ”, cultivating sensitivities towards aspects of design
that would be complex to ideate otherwise [Bardzell, 2011], and conceptualising the implications
for HCI. We focused on the seven qualities, as they pertain to a broad tradition of criticism and
are thus applicable to artworks. We then used qualitative content analysis, a research method
used for systematic analysis and pattern identification in various types of content [Krippendorff,
2018], to code the collected data for each project and each dimension. Considering the descrip-
tive nature of the data, coding is suitable for conceptualising relevant insights from the project

descriptions [Saldaña, 2013, p. 88]. The data passed a joint coding round, resulting in 173 codes. We
then conducted analytic inductive sessions between the authors for each code to produce categories
in terms of our inquiry goals and the theoretical resources on unmaking, which were primarily
constituted from Sabie et al.’s [ 2023] understanding of the concept and the five categorisations of
approaches to unmaking in HCI [Sabie et al., 2022b]. This resulted in the conceptualisation of four
main underlying themes that pertain to unmaking derived from combinations of related categories.
5 Overview of the Artworks
In this section, we will briefly describe each artwork, with a specific focus on the main temporal
idea behind the piece and its material, perceptual and meaningful qualities. A shorter description
of the artworks can be found in Table 1.
teamLab: A Forest Where Gods Live. This exhibition (see Figure 2), created by an international art
collective founded in 2001 called teamLab [teamLab, 2019a], has been held every year since 2015
at Mifuneyama Rakuen Park, with more artworks created and added to the exhibition every year.
Unlike typical exhibition venues, it is located in a remote part of Kyushu, Japan and encourages
visitors to come to the exhibition site. This work follows a current trend in Japan in which con-
temporary art is used to reanimate traditional and religious sites [Lee, 2022, p. 162]. teamLab uses
real-time animations and projections to construct interactive and immersive experiences in their
exhibitions [Li, 2020]. They superimpose non-material digital art on various natural forms of the
park, such as rocks, caves, forests and gardens, without harming the natural environment. With
more than 20 works featured in the A Forest Where Gods Live exhibition, nature is made into art
in its natural state; for example, azalea bushes light up and change colour in response to visitors
approaching them in Life is Continuous Light (see Figure 2(e)), and cherry blossoms and maple
trees light up in different colours as the visitors approach the trees or walk along the main path
inResonating Forest—Cherry Blossoms and Maple (see Figure 2(c)). These various installations are
specifically noticeable after dark when they transform the natural forms of the park. The exhibition
engages with time in various ways, either through the installations, which include representations
of the plant life cycle through the projections of blossoms that grow, flower, and eventually wither
inEver Blossoming Life Rock (see Figure 2(d)), transposing various timescales that are in the space
with digital projections, such as the history of the ruins, with column constructions that serve
as three-dimensional displays in Megaliths in the Bath House Ruins (see Figure 2(f)), or through
conceptually engaging with deep time by using light and sound on the mountain in Resonating Mt.
Mifuneyama (see Figure 2(e)).
Allochronic Cycles. This kinetic installation (see Figure 3) was created by the Cesar & Lois
collective in 2020 and exhibited at the Chronus Art Center as part of the exhibition ‘ AI Delivered:

presenting the possibility of AIs learning from complex ecological systems. The installation is
composed of four discs that follow a cyclical pattern of time for various natural timescales, such as
the cosmos, the planet Earth, the plant Arabidopsis and COVID, with each disc having a different
pattern of divisions [Cesar and Lois, 2021]. The first disc, which represents the cycle of the cosmos,
has 31 divisions, each representing a key element in the development of the cosmos, such as Sun
and Planets Form andSignificant Oxygen in Atmosphere .Theseconddiscrepresentsthegrowthcycle

Deep Time Walk. This work is a walking app (see Figure 4) that supports an audio experience of a
history of the living Earth “ across space and time ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017c]. This project was
started in 2007 by Dr. Stephan Harding and the MSc student, geologist Sergio Maraschin. Later on,
Deep Time Walk app was designed as a result of a collaboration between Robert Woodford, Geoff
Ainscow (Walk Through Time project leader), and Fred Adam (expert in using smartphones for
walking across time and space) [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017]. The project presents a guided walk
to experience and understand deep time: “ a transformative journey through 4.6bn years of Earth
history via a 4.6 km guided walk ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a]. Every metre of a Deep Time Walk

equals 1 million years, with the app adjusting the soundscape of the narration according to the
walking pace and distance based on the pedometer built into the phone (see Figure 4(a) and (b)). In
the experience, the body is used to measure the last million years, with the final 200,000 years being
equal to 20 cm and representing the approximate time our species, Homo Sapiens, has been on the
Earth. The metaphor of distance for the Earth’s geological timeline helps users gain perspective
on the Earth’s age and history. It challenges the human-centred nature of history, with nature as
simply the background for the unfolding of this history [Opus Earth, 2017]. As an “ intercultural
story-telling platform ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a], it is quite theatrical in its experience, with
the audio narrative presenting a dramatised interpretation of time delivered by the characters of
theScientist and the Fool(see Figure 4(c)).
Keeping Time. This artwork (see Figure 5) was created by artist Tega Brain in 2013, and it rep-
resents how humans see other species. Created in a time when biological events have digital
traces [Brain, 2013], the visualisation in Keeping Time is not solely the result of the social rela-
tionships with plant species but also an indicator of how the environment is changing [Brain,
2017]. It represents time as layers, with each row representing a year. Within the year, we can see
the combination of all the images tagged with a specific species name aligned according to the
timestamp. The phenological patterns of particular plant species are conveyed based on photos
posted on Flickr [Brain, 2013]. Figure 5(a) portrays how the Cowslip Orchid is rarely photographed,

with images appearing only around September. In contrast, the Sturt’s Desert Pea is much more
visible throughout the year, with abundant images taken in the summer months. Works such as
Keeping Time are important to understanding how the local climate changes different species’
cycles and how these disruptions eventually disrupt the multispecies interrelationships that depend
on synchronised cycles. It shows the patterns of plant visibility for humans, which usually focus
on certain moments of their life cycle, such as during blooming in spring or during autumn when
the leaves turn red, and then their life cycle ends [Brain, 2013]. Most of the time, we experience
seasonal plant blindness, remaining unaware of plants.
Longplayer. This musical artwork (see Figure 6) was composed by Jem Finer using singing
bowls. The composition started on 1 January 2000 and is set to continue without repetition until
2999, when it will complete its first cycle [Finer, 1999]. The musical composition will thus take
1,000 years to complete. The title of the work is an intentional choice, referencing the amount
of time it will take for the composition to finish; it is a “ gigantic loop, biting its own tail once
every millennium ” [Christenhusz, 2021]. The work consists of six pieces of music, each with a
different tempo and duration, orbiting each other like planets in a solar system for a thousand years
until they reach the common starting position, which is graphically represented in Figure 6. This
process is ensured by moving the starting point of each piece of music ahead every two minutes.
This project is comparable to six turntables or an analogue clock but with six hands [Cox, 2021].
Longplayer attempts the challenge of representing time that goes beyond the human lifespan and
many generations of humans through the metaphor of music. It takes an analogous approach by
representing the continuity of time by arranging the singing bowls in concentric circles, resembling
the solar system, with the sun as an important reference point for time passing. This composition
is accessible via an online live stream and an app, with the composition being generated on the
user’s phone. It can also be listened to at certain public listening posts.
PranatamangsaAR. Thisartwork(seeFigure 7),createdbyartistAnnaMadeleineRaupachin2018,
is an animated interpretation of an Indonesian farming calendar, connecting the various natural
events and agricultural activities in the calendar to astronomy observations [Raupach, 2018b].

The work showcases how the Pranatamangsa calendar system is threatened by changing climate
conditions. It is composed of twelve prints of star maps that correspond to an amalgamation
of natural changes and agricultural activities described in the Javanese and Sundanese farming
calendars. Essentially, it is an association between the night sky’s star map and the agricultural or
natural phenomena happening at that specific time of the year [Raupach, 2018a]. Positioning the
cosmic phenomena in contrast with day-to-day activities is intended to question and expand our
perception of time. Each print has an AR component that triggers an animation that shows the
corresponding agricultural activity or an event occurring in nature related to the flora, fauna, or
change in seasons [Raupach, 2019]. The artwork, specifically the use of AR in the project, allows
one to explore the prints chronologically or otherwise.
The Phenology Clock. This artwork (see Figure 8) was created by Natalie Jeremijenko, Jake
Richardson, Blacki Migliozzi, Tega Brain and others as part of a project on how health and the
environment are dependent on each other [Brain, 2011]. It deconstructs the ordinary clock by
replacing the standard clock time units with the twelve months of the year. Thus, January corre-
sponds to the twelve o’clock mark, with only one arrow on the clock face moving through the
months. Following the cyclical quality of phenology, the clock supports a nonhuman understanding
by representing the various urban species of a local environment that bud, bloom, emerge, or
migrate and how their lifecycles are seasonally interdependent processes [Moline et al., 2015]. As
shown in Figure 8, each species is assigned a colour and is placed in a specific concentric circle,
starting with trees and urban mammals in the outer circles and ending with fungi and microbes
in the innermost circles. While natural systems continuously change, the clock comprehensively
represents this [Agapakis, 2015]. The piece is considered a more participative way of recording and

learning about these various patterns than traditional scientific methods. As the artist Tega Brain
writes, “ [t]he practice of observing recurring environmental patterns builds an ecological perspective
of time constituted by cycles and relationships rather than the steady, linear march of machines ”
[Brain,2019].
The Present. This functional artwork is a collection of three clocks (see Figure 9) created by Scott
Thrift that tell time through the use of colour and gradients rather than seconds, minutes and hours
[Thrift,2020].The Present - Day (see Figure 9(a)), introduced in 2016, is inspired by an image of
looking at the clouds from an aeroplane in flight [Barnes, 2016]. It moves at half the speed of an
ordinary clock as one hand goes through the 24 hours of the day. The clock fragments time into
dawn, day, dusk and night, represented through a blue gradient that conveys the change from day
to night. The Present - Moon (see Figure 9(b)), introduced in 2020, follows the moon cycle, with the
hand of the clock in the light during a new moon and in shadow during a full moon [Thrift, 2020].

It was inspired by the ancient symbol of non-duality, yin-yang, evoking “ the interconnected oneness
of all things ” [Han, 2020]. Lastly, The Present - Year (see Figure 9(c)) addresses the idea of the
circularity of time by presenting a clock that is focused on the natural passing of time, specifically
by switching the hours for the seasons of the year with a single hand moving through hues of
blue, green, yellow and red. Thus, short intervals, usually associated with clock time, are now
visualised as a “ unified, colorful spectrum mirroring the seasons of the year ” [Pavlus, 2011]. The
colour hues represent Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, with the Winter Solstice at the top
marked by white, the Summer Solstice at the bottom marked with pure yellow, and the Spring and
Fall Equinoxes on each side marked with pure green and red [Marchese, 2020]. Thrift explains how
the mechanism for the annual movement of the clock had to be invented, as it did not exist before,
along with software that would set the clock to the day that it was turned on, i.e., “ to the present ”
[PSFK,2013].
TheRoomofChange. Thisartwork(seeFigure 10)wascreatedbythedatadesignstudioAccuratas
an introductory installation for the 22nd Triennale Milano International Exhibition Broken Nature:
Design Takes on Human Survival , in 2019. It is a collection of stories and relationships between
humans, technology and nonhuman beings. The 30-metre-long hand-crafted data tapestry has a
snapshotofaparticularmomentintimeoneachverticalsection,andeachhorizontalsectionfollows
a story as it evolves through time, visualising events of the past, present and future [Lupi, 2019].
The data-based visualisation depicts eight topics: nature,universe ,animal kingdom ,society,hope,
happiness ,scienceandtechnology . Each topic in The Room of Change has three underlining events
represented through a visual pattern, e.g., for nature, the events are the disappearance of the Aral
Sea,the human impact on the environment andthe effects of climate change (see Figure 10(a)). The
artwork is supplemented by a legend explaining how to read the individual stories [Accurat, 2019b].
In addition to the data tapestry, The Room of Change is also accompanied by two large screens
that show a selection of before-and-after images from the NASA Archive that present the results
of melting glaciers or urbanisation that have happened in the past 20 years [Bradley, 2019] (see
Figure10(b)). These larger-scale projections contrast with the contextual story of change depicted
in the visualisation. The Room of Change considers the complexity of entanglements between
global and local phenomena and collective and individual perspectives, showing the change that is
constantly occurring at these various levels [Accurat, 2019a]. This artwork reveals how change is
composed of incremental moments rather than being an objective and universal fact that is usually
shown to us from “ far away and high above ” [Pentagram, 2019].

Unequal Hours. This room-size installation (see Figure 11), created by artist Anna Madeleine
Raupach in 2021, is a vivid representation of how alternate timescales intersect, explicitly showing
how various natural forms intersect with human clock time while operating on alternate timescales
[Raupach, 2021]. Presented at the Canberra Museum and Gallery in 2021, it includes mechanical
clockshangingfromtheceiling,eachwithasinglearrow,movingintheirowncyclesandconnected
by coloured ribbons. The name of the piece, Unequal Hours , is a time concept used before tools for
synchronisation and coordination, such as clocks, were designed. Each clock represents a natural,
human, or technological timescale [Raupach, 2021] (see Figure 11(b) for an overview of the various
timescales). The clocks present natural timescales such as whale migration, the moon’s orbit, and
eclipse cycles, and human timescales such as breathing, the menstrual cycle, grape harvesting and
population growth and decline.
6 Analysis
Here, we will present our analysis of the artworks based on our research questions. This analysis
thereby focuses on what theoretical underpinnings and intellectual concerns these works engage
with, how they can be seen to unmake time within this discourse, and how unmaking takes
form. Following the critical analysis of these artworks, we conceptualised four themes: dissecting
temporality ,the unmaking of the singular ,unmaking as messing up andunmaking the other , with
each theme consisting of three subtopics. We will thus dive into what each theme represents and
the role that unmaking plays in it. An overview of the key insights from the four main themes is
provided in Table 2, with a larger scale of the media artworks in Figure 12.

Table 2. Overview of the Key Ideas from the Four Main Themes Conceptualised in the Analysis
Theme Subtheme Overview
Dissecting TemporalityMultiple Orientations—Steers between relations of past, present, and future, such as in Allochronic Cycles andDeep Time Walk , and engages with the challenge of dividing
one’s perception between these multiple temporal orientations
—A similar multiplicity is shown in The Phenology Clock through the variety of species and their temporalities and in The Present with its support for
alternative experiences of being in time, past or future
Multiple Dimensions—This subtheme grapples with ideas of scale. Human and other-than-human timescales are superimposed in works such as A Forest Where Gods Live ,
The Room of Change ,Longplayer , andDeep Time Walk . This approach is used to position the human timescale in relation to grander scales to stimulate
emotions and reflections on the human impact on natural systems.
—We bring out the notion of the hyperobject and its various characteristics in reference to the musical composition Longplayer and the full-body experience
of deep time in Deep Time Walk .
Multiple Temporalities—This subtheme underlines how multiplicity is pervasive across the artworks, with additional investigations on how Longplayer andDeep Time Walk
engage with sound to attune to temporalities that exceed human timescales.
—Interconnections between human and nonhuman temporalities in Unequal Hours ,The Present , andA Forest Where Gods Live
Unmaking of the SingularPlurality in Materials—Materialisation of story-telling through time-based media such as Pranatamangsa AR
—Tangible representations of a cyclical view of time in The Present
—Artificial life forms seeking methods for survival, such as Longplayer , or that create themselves possible worlds, like Allochronic Cycles
Plurality in Representation—Artworks that show the quality of adaptability in their design, such as The Phenology Clock , which presents the lifecycles of the plant and animal
species of a local area, or Longplayer , which aims to endure through technological obsolescence and social change
—Artworks that present resilience through a long-term thinking perspective, such as The Present , which was constructed to work for a long time
autonomously, The Room of Change , which represents data of a speculative future in 2,400, or Deep Time Walk , which engages the listeners in
future thinking through a walking audio experience of geological time
—Artworks that present gentle and undemanding representations of time, such as A Forest Where Gods Live , where nature is portrayed in a
calming visual style, or The Present , which considers a simplified representation of seasonal, circadian, and lunar cycles
Plurality in Experiences—Artworks that engage with conceptions of space-time, such as perceptions of being frozen in time in teamLab’s work, The Room of Change ,
The Present - Year , andDeep Time Walk . Except for The Room of Change , these artworks either represent the idea of the
slow flow of time, such as in teamLab’s work, or engage users to experience slowness and slow down, such as in The Present ,Deep Time Walk ,
andLongplayer .
—Suggests how Deep Time Walk breaks human/nature and mind/body dualisms through its place-based and adaptable locative media,
while teamLab’s exhibition engages its visitors in expressions of play and traces of rituals
Unmaking as Messing UpEntanglements in Knowledge—Artworks that are a result of transdisciplinary work between art, science, and technology, such as Deep Time Walk ,A Forest Where Gods
Live, andAllochronic Cycles
—Artworks like The Present andDeep Time Walk engage with the challenge of temporal illiteracy by advancing alternative understandings
of time and subscribe to the teaching practice of the four ways of knowing in the case of Deep Time Walk .
Entanglements in Practice—Artworks like A Forest Where Gods Live andPranatamangsa AR make use of SAR to create immersive
installations with blurred boundaries between the overlayed digital materials and the natural physical forms in the former, and seamful
interfaces that present a multilayered environment in the augmented world in the latter. The augmentation is also manifested in Deep Time
Walkthrough the immersive audio narrative.
Entanglements in
More-than-Human Relations—Variety of human-nonhuman associations through a kinesthetic entanglement between various timescales of physically linked clocks in
Unequal Hours
-Variations of cycles that include circadian, lunar, and seasonal cycles in The Present
—Tinkering with scale through the different discs that showcase biological and geological processes in Allochronic Cycles
—Interdependencies between local urban species are represented in The Phenology Clock , whileKeeping Time focuses on nature-culture
connections.
—A Forest Where Gods Live navigates connections between visitors, art, and place.
—Deep Time Walk presents the entanglement of humans with the history of the Earth.
—Longplayer portrays the dependency of its survival on human demand.

Theme Subtheme Overview
Unmaking the OtherSearching for New Perspectives—Artworks encourage reflection on conventional ideas of time through design in Keeping Time , with additional attunement to the cyclical nature
of time in The Phenology Clock andThe Present .
—Artworks such as Longplayer andDeep Time Walk take a sonic approach to introduce the listeners to deep time and harmonise us to rhythms of
a large scale.
—Pranatamangsa AR unravels how the evolution of technology, such as animation, shapes our understanding and experience of time.
Searching for Disseminating Tools—This theme focuses on the various material strategies used to diffuse alternative ideas.
—Keeping Time andThe Phenology Clock make use of data visualisation to intervene between anthropocentric living and make space for
representations of nature-culture interdependence. These artworks encourage users, no matter the generation or discipline, to create interest surrounding
more-than-human concerns, with Deep Time Walk presenting a variety of functionalities that make the experience much more accessible and
resources to continue diving into the topic or offering the ability to engage in the discourse actively.

6.1 Dissecting Temporality
This theme is focused on deconstructing the singular ideas of time by concentrating on the multiple.
This idea of multiplicity is rooted in, for example, Tsing’s engagement with polyphony as a noticing
of how various melodies synchronise or clash, matching to the “ multiple temporal rhythms and
trajectories of the assemblage ” [Tsing, 2015, p. 24]. It is also a key aspect in Alaimo’s concept of
transcorporeality,whichismaintainedby“ multiplehorizontalcrossings,transitsandtransformations ”
[Alaimo, 2018]. This is followed by a disposition in HCI to develop a “ multiple timescale sensibility ”
to assess the long-term impact of technologies [Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022]. The creators of
Allochronic Cycles mention how, in the process of creating the piece, they have ‘ dissected ’ time and
‘decoded’ the temporal perspectives of species such as Arabidopsis and lichens [Cesar and Lois,
2021]. Similarly, teamLab’s exhibition explicitly points to traces of unmaking in installations such
asMegaliths in the Bath House Ruins [teamLab, 2019b] andEver Blossoming Life Rock [teamLab,
2017a] by portraying perpetual cycles of growth and decay. We thus unpack how temporality is
unmade in the selection of artworks by looking at the multiple orientations in and through time,
themultiple dimensions of engaging with scale, and the multiple temporalities that the artworks
represent.
6.1.1 MultipleOrientations. Thereisacertainconnectionbetweenthepastandfutureembedded
in the artworks in various ways. Some users of The Present described how the artwork supported
an appreciation for the past and looking forward to the future [The Present, 2023c]. InAllochronic
Cycles, the creators maintain that in order to “ move forward, we look backwards across millennia ”
[Cesar and Lois, 2021], with the AI predicting the future human impact on the various timescales
represented by the four other discs according to atmospheric carbon levels. In other ways, artworks
suchas ThePhenologyClock illustratethemultiplicityofotherspeciesandthuspresentopportunities
to develop tools that embrace this multiplicity rather than holding on to solely human timescales.
We also identified how artworks like The Present take on experiential conceptions of time. This
relates to the discrepancy between being on time, which is supported by conventional and linear
time-telling tools, and being in time, which is encouraged by artefacts such as The Present that
source new perspectives on various challenges, which are primarily environmentally related. We
see this combination in other works such as Deep Time Walk . The experience with the app focuses
on presenting an embodied way of engaging with deep time, using deep movement, as opposed to
being static and fixed like clock time [Opus Earth, 2016]. While some features in the app, like the
Millions of Years Ago Indicator, represent the standard idea of time, these blend seamlessly with
the other features in the app without taking away from the main goal: to experience deep time.
6.1.2 Multiple Dimensions. The artworks engage with scale in various ways. teamLab inten-
tionally uses natural forms that embody long periods of time, such as rocks and trees, in their
exhibition, as these are materialisations of spans of past time flowing into the continuous present.
Thus, when including natural timescales and natural forms that are on a grander scale and surpass
the human timescale, we can position ourselves in the long continuity of time [teamLab, 2019a].
Thus, deep time as a threshold concept [Meyer and Land, 2003] launches new ways of thinking
and understanding the world. However, by introducing a deep time perspective, an unavoidable
friction is created, related to how, on the one hand, humanity is simply an insignificant blip on
the geological timescale. On the other hand, the human impact has been enormously powerful for
such a small amount of time.
To understand the entanglement of multiple temporalities, such as ecological time, the philoso-
pher Timothy Morton introduces the concept of hyperobjects, which are defined as “ things that are
massively distributed in time and space relative to humans ” [Morton, 2013, p. 1]. A characteristic
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
80:24 P.Ciobanu and Y.Fernaeus
of hyperobjects is their temporal undulation , which occurs incrementally due to their dimension,
making it seem as if they happen extremely slowly [Morton, 2013, p. 55]. As a result, we can
experience a fragment of the hyperobject but never its entirety. Climate change is an example of a
hyperobject. As something massive in its space-time proportions, it is not sensorially perceivable.
Through Longplayer , Finer encourages us to attune to hyperobjects, such as climate change, that are
undeniably pressing challenges. However, considering the size of the composition, the artwork is in
itself a form of hyperobject, as we can only experience a fraction of it, expressing “ a certain kind of
musical anti-optimality ” [Koutsomichalis, 2018]. Thus, hyperobjects imply a complex entanglement
of temporalities, of which humans are a part.
Variousmetaphorsareusedtotranslatescale,suchascreatingexperiencesinvolvingthephysical
movement of the body as a reference point or measuring tool. This approach is one way to unravel
thethreshold effect caused by how “ hundreds of millennia and millions of years takes us well beyond
the scope of direct human experience ” [Trend, 2001]. While various metaphors have also been
used as a solution to this challenge, such as representing deep time as a clock or calendar, these
numerical or written representations fall behind compared to full-body experiences or corporeal
ways of knowing [Pink et al., 2010].Deep Time Walk draws from these points and engages the
body in perceiving deep time. There is also a specific sound that indicates when the storytelling is
paused, with the audio narrative matching the pace of the listener’s movement. However, due to
the loaded descriptive narration, it is similar to listening to a scientific audiobook, making it hard
to concentrate on what is said. Nevertheless, sound is essential for exploring temporality, place,
interactions and interdependence. Taking a sonic approach to engaging with the Anthropocene
“brings into the world novel relations, it shifts paradigms and builds new formations ” [Kanngieser,
2015].
The Room of Change depicts change through various scales and dimensions, with a legend that
explains the data visualisation, which is crucial for allowing a visitor to understand and ‘see’ the
artwork. This project impresses visitors and sparks emotions and reflections on the social and
natural changes in our world’s past, present and future. It does so by presenting a visualisation that
mentions no numbers, and it is unclear what the different bands mean until one reads the legend.
As a combination of “ objective data and artistic presentation ”, the sheer scale of the work leaves
visitors experiencing “ data vertigo ” [Kennedy, 2019]. This piece represents the world from both
global and local perspectives [Pentagram, 2019]. It is more visible than other artworks due to its
physical nature and scale. The artwork also provides the possibility for interactions of different
durations. They can be long term, as reading the legend, understanding the data and going through
different moments takes time. At the same time, they can be short term, as the user can target a
specific period or topic, switch between past, present, or future changes, or avoid a topic altogether.
6.1.3 MultipleTemporalities. Artworks such as Deep Time Walk andLongplayer , due to their
acoustic experiences and the added embodied experience in Deep Time Walk , present opportunities
to sensorially attune to non-anthropocentric temporalities that usually exceed our cultural frames
of reference [Christenhusz, 2021]. As listening is an affective and embodied practice of engaging
with the world [Voegelin, 2010, p. 3],Longplayer enables us to “ share time and space with the object
or event under consideration ”[Christenhusz, 2021].Asonicexperiencethusoccursandisfeltintime,
withsoundfosteringsensitivitytowardsotherwiseunreachabletimescales.Additionally,concerning
scale, there is the added challenge of duration, as the Longplayer composition, while there is a
conceptual understanding that it is a loop, is perceptually limited when it comes to experiencing
it as such [Cox, 2021].Longplayer is a “sonic exercise in ecological thinking ” [Christenhusz, 2021],
with the listener able to experience a fraction of these large timescales.
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:25
Artworks such as Unequal Hours illustrate a kinaesthetic presentation of a temporal interdepen-
dence across species from small to large scales. Similarly, in The Phenology Clock , the temporal
interdependence that we attune to is between the species, flora and fauna of a local place. This
phenomenon can be seen between artefacts as well. As one user of The Present describes, The Present
- DayandThe Present - Year connect at a particular moment every day by pointing in the same
direction, which in winter happens in the morning [The Present, 2023c]. This implies that there
are also moments of difference, when the clock hands point in opposite directions. Similarly, the
Ever Blossoming Life Rock installation in teamLab’s exhibition contrasts the experience with the
artwork, which is defined by a lived experience of temporality and the temporality of the boulder,
which is timeless and marked by seasonal changes [Lee, 2022, p. 158]. The installation Megaliths in
the Bath House Ruins , through the rectangular prism forms, warps space and time and showcases
various patterns of continuity and change that reveal what has been forgotten or submerged. These
space-times can intersect, overlap and be compressed.
6.2 Unmaking of the Singular
The theme of the unmaking of the singular is here analysed by looking at expressions of plurality in
materials ,representation andexperiences .Pluralismdeconstructsstandardconventionsbycultivating
alternatives to normative discourses [Bardzell, 2010], which is critical in posthumanist thought
and “makes knowing expansive (or inclusionary) rather than exclusionary ” [Wakkary, 2020]. The
artworks we analyse explore the many ecological realities imbued with plural temporal and spatial
relations. They utilise a variety of materials that more heavily focus on the embodied experience
with time and move away from conventional representations.
6.2.1 PluralityinMaterials. Theworkspresentagreatmaterialvarietyintermsoftangibleforms,
such as the ribbons in Unequal Hours ; digital forms, like the extensive data used in The Room of
Change;andenvironmentalaspects,suchasthenatureandruinsinanaturalparkin A Forest Where
Gods Live and the various plant specimens pressed into powder form in Allochronic Cycles . Time-
based media projects, such as Pranatamangsa AR , are notably valuable for representing abstract
notions of time and environmental changes that are connected to different ecologies [Raupach,
2018a]. Additionally, The Present makes tangible the cyclical idea of time, which is often slippery,
while the creation of Longplayer was instigated by the challenge of “ representing and understanding
the fluidity and expansiveness of time ”[Longplayer, 2005].Longplayer representstheideaofartificial
life, as throughout the 1,000-year-long process, it “ would not only be a real living organism with a
life and tradition all its own but one with a capacity to propel itself by its own momentum ” [Young
and Zazeela, 2004, p. 16]. Similarly, the AI in Allochronic Cycles is considered a nonhuman agency
that presents the possibility of symbiotic living between humans and nonhumans, thus envisioning
a posthuman future [Ga, 2021]. The AI observes the various timescales and their interactions,
potentially interrupting and resetting them [Cesar and Lois, 2021].
Environmental observations are increasingly technology mediated, as satellites, weather stations
and data centres are replacing direct embodied engagements to understand and detect changes
in the climate [Brain, 2017]. This development can be used as an opportunity to develop digital
tools that shed light on the lives of other creatures [Smith et al., 2017]. Thus, more imaginative
ways of communication are required, which is what Pranatamangsa AR aims to support. The
animations used in the artwork can support the representation of abstract temporalities and the
conceptualisation of time in relation to climate change [Raupach, 2018a]. AR, in this case, was
used to “ disrupt the linear order of this work ” [Raupach, 2018a], as the participants could choose
the order in which to read the prints. This reordering from the original timeline represents the
unpredictability of environmental disruptions in the current state of climate change [Raupach,
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
80:26 P.Ciobanu and Y.Fernaeus
2018b]. This combination of still and moving images through AR presents the multiple timescales
entangled in climate change and the disruptions happening to familiar natural changes. As the
components,i.e.themovingimage,technologyandphysicalobjects,functionondifferenttimescales
but co-exist in the same space and are experienced together, animation fuses the spatial barrier
between these temporalities [Raupach, 2018a]. This allows a layered construction of time across
multiple planes, with a particular negotiation between the various temporalities.
6.2.2 PluralityinRepresentation. Consideringthatthemanynaturalprocessesrelatedtoclimate,
temperature, or biodiversity will function differently compared to what we currently expect, having
artefacts that account for the changes sets an example for designing artefacts that are adaptable due
to the unpredictability of the natural environment [Smith et al., 2017].The Phenology Clock is such
an example. As a data-driven artwork, it concentrates on a local scale, such as a city, focusing on the
plant and animal species of the area. The artwork thus presents similar ideas to the field of collapse
informatics [Tomlinson et al., 2013], which focuses on designing for scarcity by putting forth
designs that are adaptive to the variability of various natural processes rather than implementing
fixed designs. It invites participants to reflect on the natural patterns in their local environment
rather than looking at the data retrospectively [Agapakis, 2015]. Having the artwork in a clock
form, with a hand passing through the months, makes it much more dynamic than its rectangular,
more static counterpart, Keeping Time .
Another aspect of adaptability is the many ways the long term is addressed and expressed.
Artefacts such as The Present are constructed to continue displaying the yearly cycle for a long time
[The Present, 2023a].The Room of Change illustrates a sense of complexity and long-termism, with
the represented data starting from 1,000 B.C. and ending in a speculative future (2,400) [Bradley,
2019]. Moreover, Deep Time Walk makes use of mobile media to create experiences that sustain
an understanding of “ where we really are in time and space so that we can comprehend our future
trajectory ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a]. Similarly, Longplayer prompts a reflection on the future
and the permanence of humanity, culture and technology [Cox, 2021]. It has adaptability in mind,
as it is composed in such a way as to be independent of any technological and social change. As a
durational work, it raises questions about technological obsolescence, as the current technology
that supports it will eventually have to be replaced [Martynski, 2021, p. 120]. With this in mind,
the complementary app on which the musical composition can be listened to was also designed to
be easily updated, which Finer refers to as “‘the deep space mission approach’: making something
that needs minimum change over time to guarantee its survival ” [Bridle, 2015].
Other pieces take a more straightforward approach to representation. Many of the installations
in teamLab’s exhibition revolve around creating unique shapes, lines and combinations, with an
image of nature as “ ideal and simplified ” [Li,2020, p. 78]. The installation Universe of Water Particles
on a Sacred Rock is an example, taking inspiration from the belief that water has a purifying ability,
as expressed in the indigenous religion Shintoism. The calming visual style is also the result of a
collaboration with the contemporary Nihonga painter Hiroshi Senju, who depicts serene waterfalls
inspired by traditional Shanshui and ukiyo-e masters [Li, 2020, p. 78]. Similarly, according to
Thrift, timescales that follow seasonal, circadian and lunar rhythms are simplified and elementary
representations of time, compared to the standardised units of time such as seconds, minutes and
hours [Han, 2020]. Such a simplified view provides a calmer experience and gives the impression
of having more time than a normal clock.
6.2.3 Plurality in Experiences. Some artworks engage with embodiments of space-time, such as
moments being frozen in time. This concept of space-time is used in teamLab’s work to define the
relationship between a space and its temporality. For example, the ruins in the Mifuneyama forest
are its own space-time, and the bathhouse represents a place where “ time had stopped completely ”,
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:27
as it was abandoned shortly after being built [teamLab, 2019b].The Room of Change engages with
this idea by representing in its visualisation “ a snapshot of a precise moment frozen in time ” [Lupi,
2019]. Meanwhile, The Present - Year is the embodiment of a clock that seems to be standing still
or where time seems to have stopped, as no movement or sound can be detected, refocusing our
attentiononthepresent.Whiletheseartworkspresentorengagewithspace-timesthatarestanding
still, users of Deep Time Walk can stop time by simply standing still. As the app uses the pedometer
to trigger the narration, when the listener stops walking, the narration also stops, which creates a
space-timeofstandingstill.Additionally,eachwalkwith DeepTimeWalk createsitsownspace-time
depending on where the participant was walking. This is an example of compressed space-time:
the walk through the Earth’s history is reduced to 1 hour and 30 minutes.
This is followed by depictions of the slow flow of time in artworks such as A Forest Where Gods
Live, in which the forest surrounding the Mifuneyama Rakuen Park changes slowly over the course
of the year and then starts its cycle anew [teamLab, 2019a]. Similarly, The Present is an artwork
that presents the value of slowness and is meant to help its users slow down [The Present, 2023b].
The gradual gradient enables this feeling of time slowly flowing, which a rigid calendar grid does
not achieve [Drumm, 2016]. Moreover, in The Present-Day , the placement of the hand, compared
to a usual clock, visually gives the sense of having more time, as the hand is placed only halfway
when the standard clock shows 6 PM [Drumm, 2016]. As Thrift explains, when one is unable to
track every moment that passes by through numbers, each moment is slowed down and perceived
as if there is much more time left [Kushnick, 2016]. The artwork contrasts tools that value speed,
efficiency and productivity by providing a slowing down of daily life. The changes in The Present are
perceived quite similarly to how we perceive changes in nature, i.e., they are noticeable after some
time, adding a meditative simplicity to the experience [m ss ng p eces, 2011]. With Deep Time Walk ,
walking is the practice that alters the sense of time, creating a slower and exposed experience of
interacting with the environment [Martynski, 2021]. The slowness is also embedded in Longplayer ,
as it is similar to experiencing a slowly moving analogue clock [Cox, 2021].
Locative media offers many opportunities to build place-based experiences that are adaptable to
thetravelleddistanceandpace[DugganandGoldschmidtKiminami, 2021,p.8].Asanentanglement
betweenthenarrative,environmentandwalker, DeepTimeWalk embraceswalkingasanexperience
that “folds body, self, other humans and nonhumans, time-space and place together ” [Edensor, 2010].
This work creates associations between the walk and deep time, as well as associations and attune-
ment to the place in which one walks, imbuing the space with new meanings [Martynski, 2021,
p. 141]. The work, on the one hand, aims to dismantle the human/nature dualism by emphasising
the entanglement between human and geological time and multispecies entanglement [Haraway,
2016] in general. On the other hand, it aims to “ break the paradigm of an isolated and abstracted
digital world ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a] by challenging the mind/body dualism and situating
the “body as a site of knowledge development ” [Martynski, 2021, p. 116]. This way of walking is
attentional , focused on attuning and responding to the environment, rather than intentional , which
happens when one is travelling from point A to point B [Ingold, 2015, p. 133].
Play is another experiential aspect specific to teamLab’s work. In installations such as Resonating
Mt.Mifuneyama andLifeisContinuousLight ,playisshowninthepresenceofvisitorsbyresponding
to their movements with light. When installations such as these are part of a specific natural site,
rather than a museum or gallery, play takes a considerable role in creating “ more believable realities ”
and a more holistic and complete exhibition [Li, 2020, p. 113]. All the different elements in the
exhibition, both imagined and real, have a role in creating a more immersive and embodied
experience in which play becomes part of the sensory sphere. Entangled in play are rituals, another
important part of teamLab’s work, as both rituals and play have the capacity to transport people to
another world [Huizinga, 1949, p. 18]. Various ceremonial aspects are embedded in the A Forest

Mifuneyama.
6.3 Unmaking as Messing Up
This theme foregrounds the ‘mess’ of entanglements implicit within the artworks. Compared
to the ‘clean’ and objective look of a standard clock, and although the projects also present a
clean aesthetic, the underlying processes are messy, with the added complexity of interconnected
temporalities that can be difficult to untangle. Entanglement as a concept within new materialism
points towards how we are interdependent, through technology, ecosystems and other beings, and
entangled in various complex relations. This indicates an absence of “ independent, self contained
existence ”, as we materialise through and as part of this entanglement [Barad, 2007]. Artefacts
also present deep entanglements , particularly in relation to their impact on future generations
[Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022]. We here explore unmaking as messing up by describing how
these artworks embody and present different connections, muddying the previously clean and
ordered worldview. We thus engage in a process of untangling what has been weaved: we follow
how various threads intertwine to understand the diverse aspects of their connections. Thus, we
do not engage in absolute separation, material or otherwise, but conceptually unmake what is
interconnected and typically unseen. In the following, we will focus specifically on untangling the
connections in knowledge ,practice andmore-than-human relations .
6.3.1 EntanglementsinKnowledge. The artworks engage with and draw from various disciplines
to unpack the topic of time. Along with The Present ,Deep Time Walk addresses “ temporal illiteracy ”
[PSFK,2013]byformingabetterrelationshipwithtimeandadvancingnotonlyanunderstandingof
deep time but also a sense of timefulness , which implies knowingthe history of the Earth and taking
a geologist’s perspective on time—the perspective needed for moving towards sustainable futures
[Bjornerud, 2018].Deep Time Walk draws from the teaching practices of the Four Ways of Knowing
proposed by Jung [Jung, 2016, p. 401]: sensation ,feeling,intuition andthinking . This methodology
has contemplation as the main element that supports learning and building an ecological awareness
[Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017b], illustrating how combining knowledge and creativity can lead to
rethinking our place on Earth [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a]. The script of the audio narrative
ofDeep Time Walk is the result of a collaboration between science and humanities disciplines,
represented by the scientist Dr Stephan Harding and the playwright Peter Oswald, respectively
[Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2022]. The narration follows the characters of the Fool and the Scientist as
they embark on a journey to uncover the history of the Earth’s geological timeline. This form is
used to mend the fragmentation between disciplines and forms of knowledge [Martynski, 2021,
p. 116]. As a fusion of technology, science and poetry [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a], this work
is intended as an interdisciplinary activity that can be used in an academic setting [Curi, 2017].
teamLab’s work also lies at the intersection of art, science, technology and the natural world, as
they implement various collaborative practices [teamLab, 2023]. Cesar & Lois’s work is another
example of transdisciplinary work that represents layers of timescales ranging from viruses and
plantgrowthtothehistoryoftheuniverse.Lastly, Allochronic Cycles pointstothecreativepotential
of humans and nonhumans when they collectively work together and how this potential is valuable
in imagining new posthuman worlds [Ga, 2021].
6.3.2 EntanglementsinPractice. Artworksemployvariouspracticesforbridgingthegapbetween
virtual and natural environments. This is the case for Pranatamangsa AR and its use of seamful
interfaces, which have a slight gap or mismatch between the physical space and the virtually
created one [Chalmers and Galani, 2004]. As the inconsistencies between these spaces are evident,
the AR is used to support viewers in moving between the various visual layers, allowing them to

Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:29
“negotiate various rhythms and temporal scales ” [Raupach, 2018a]. Navigating such a multilayered
environment develops new behaviours and a new sense of self composited into the augmented
world[Roquet, 2016].Animationintheartworkisusedtosupportexperimentationwithexpressing,
understanding and experiencing time. Animation is a collection of still images made frame-by-
frame and viewed quickly in a series to give the impression of motion [Raupach, 2018a]. This
characteristic allows one to explore the idea of change and the passage of time, and animation
itself recollects how our understanding of time has changed throughout the years [Johnston,
2015, p. 227]. Raupach [ 2018a] explains that what differentiates animation from narrative-based
moving images is that it creates a distinct sense of movement and, thus, an alternative engagement
with time.
In the case of Deep Time Walk , the experience of walking through 4.6 billion years of Earth’s
history is mediated through mobile technology. The app aims to shift focus from the smartphone
screen to the natural world through an augmented audio narrative, rather than acting as a barrier
to the natural world. In this context, this poses a challenge, as the technology meant to be in the
background, e.g., in one’s pocket, creates a dependent experience with the phone, especially when
various technological glitches occur; for example, one might check the phone when the narrative
seemingly stops. However, the user can switch to Gaiaphonic Mode to make the sound play only
on one earbud to listen to both the story and the surroundings while walking, which can help
remedy this dependency. The space also influences the experience and can further distract from the
narrative, making it difficult to refocus. Furthermore, another contradiction concerns how the app
aims to bring us into communion with the natural world, with the experience often being isolated
from others and individual in character. This raises concerns on how interconnectedness within
nature can be developed under these circumstances [Martynski, 2021, p. 179].
A more seamless convergence of both natural and digital aspects is done in teamLab’s work,
affording a “ deep interpenetration of self, image, and world ” [Lee,2022, p. 153]. Removing the
boundaries between virtual and real-world environments through spatial augmented reality
(SAR)decentres the environment, erasing the bounds between visitors, the natural world and art.
Additionally, this adds more layers to spatial perception, augmenting the idea of nature. Such an
entanglement between the environment and the “ digital handlings, visuals, sounds, touches and
smells” [Li,2020, p. 113] transforms nature into art. SAR is used in several installations within
the exhibition A Forest Where Gods Live to support a more immersive and embodied experience
for the visitors [Lee, 2022, p. 155]. Interactions with the visitors are seen in the form of flowers
blooming when a visitor stands still in front of the installation or the flow of water being redirected
inMegaliths in the Bath House Ruins . In the exhibition, visitors could be seen running wild in
the forest, standing quietly and contemplatively, or touching the trees and flowers [Li, 2020, p.
76]. The interactive installations are also connected with each other and cause changes far away
from the source. For example, the presence of people causes ripples of light in the forest through
Resonating Forest and the neighbouring azaleas through Life is Continuous Light . In the Resonating
Mt. Mifuneyama installation, the sound and light patterns travel various distances within the
exhibition place, blending with the natural forms, such as the plants and mountains.
6.3.3 EntanglementsinMore-than-HumanRelations. The artworks present the entanglements
within the more-than-human in various ways. Unequal Hours physically represents the entangle-
ments between human, nonhuman and technological timescales. For example, its menstrual cycle
clock is connected to the clocks representing wages, referencing the gender pay gap [Mandryk,
2021].The Present , with its three variations of time perception, builds on the aspect of connect-
edness with the world by presenting a holistic experience of a day, synchronisation with the
moon and more extensively with the cosmos, and lastly, a built connection with the Earth and its
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.

seasonal cycles. The piece allows for a shared experience and vision of time to manifest across
every part of the Earth: when it is a full moon on The Present - Moon clock, it is so for every
living being, which creates a form of multispecies entanglement. In like manner, Allochronic Cy-
clespresents time as fragmented in contrasting, concentric circles based on different geological
and biological processes, setting the boundaries for time and scale [Cesar and Lois, 2021]. While
the artwork’s name points to how we are disconnected from geological processes and timelines,
it intends to synchronise us with other species and even broader planetary systems to become
more-than-human.
Approachesintimerepresentationsuchas ThePhenologyClock andKeepingTime areconsiderably
valuable at this stage of climate change, as they shift our focus towards understanding how natural
systems work and contribute to a collective reimagining of our relationship with nature. They
deal with the various reoccurring processes in animals and plants and are valuable in indicating
how and which patterns of various species change due to environmental disruptions. This causes
interrelated species to fall out of sync and endangers the entire ecosystem. Tega Brain gives the
example of pollinators and the flowering cycle, which creates a temporal relationship that is based
on synchronicity [Brain, 2013]. Cultural practices also depend on phenological patterns, such as the
Tomatina festival in Valencia, Spain, exemplifying how nature and culture are connected [Brain,
2013].
As a multi-sensory immersive experience, A Forest Where Gods Live makes use of digital technol-
ogy to blur the boundaries between the visitors, the built garden, and the forest and bring the focus
to more-than-human interdependence [Lee, 2022, p. 162]. Considering that Mifuneyama Rakuen
is a site with specific sacred associations, the exhibition visitors develop a connection with this
aspect of the place and a sense of harmony with the natural world [Lee, 2022, p. 162]. teamLab’s
work can be considered a form of land art, as it creates relationality between the artworks and the
landscape [Lee, 2022, p. 162].
Deep Time Walk has an important role in reconnecting us to the natural world by acknowledging
that we are a part of nature itself and indicating how various natural forms, such as mountains
and animals, are our ancestors [Opus Earth, 2016]. It supports an experience through which we,
as participants, can understand the various geological processes that occurred to allow life to
evolve up to this point, such as plate tectonics, the formation of oxygen-producing photosynthesis,
or planet-wide temperature regulation. This project shows how everyone is entangled in deep
time and the geological impact we are currently having [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017b]. An aim
ofDeep Time Walk is for people to become what Jonas Salk calls “ good ancestors ”, meaning that
they “consider their decisions based on long-term, intergenerational justice ” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C,
2021a]. Similarly, Longplayer raises questions about stewardship [Martynski, 2021, p. 120]; in
contrast to the various efforts towards making the work autonomous, Finer expresses how it
has never been intended to be “ a self-sustaining sonic beacon ringing out to no one ” [La Frenais,
2019]. While the work could become autonomous, it should continue only if people want it to. It
could be maintained generation after generation, with people continuously taking responsibility
for it.
6.4 Unmaking the Other
Following the thematic of alternatives, we explore the unmaking of the other as unpacking the
otherworld-making possibilities in addition to standard views, devices and expressions. The ‘other’
is imbued with an idea of being separate, disassociated and excluded. We notice the use of the
otherin posthumanist writing, such as the use of other-than-human, or when the dualism of
self/other is challenged. Designing otherwise is increasingly being encouraged to challenge the
conventional ways of designing by proposing different ways of affecting the world [Abdulla, 2018]
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:31
and designing with care [Helms, 2023]. We engage with otherness by conceptualising how the
artworks successfully express other perspectives , use various tools otherwise for dissemination , and
focus on other living beings .
6.4.1 Searching for New Perspectives. These artworks present new perspectives on time by
stretchingtheconventionalideasoftimethatanormalclockprovides. Longplayer ,forexample,takes
asonicapproachtorepresentinglong-termperiodsoftime,while PranatamangsaAR usesanimation
to create possibilities for alternative imaginings to be combined with the natural environment.
Raupach found the limitations in change and compressed temporality in animations indicative of
thedestabilisationofPranatamangsaknowledgeasitshiftsduetoenvironmentalchanges[Raupach,
2018a]. Similarly, Keeping Time aligns with ideas from design for reflection [Baumer et al., 2014],
which aims to encourage users to reflect on a specific topic, which in this case is the social and
cultural relations with and around different plant species.
Artworks such as The Phenology Clock also challenge traditional ideas of time. Although we
follow the change in seasons and have calendars that reflect this, this is just a small part of the
multiplicity of temporalities in the natural environment [Smith et al., 2017].The Present aims to
put things into perspective for those pressured by time, to change how time is experienced daily
alongside the conventional clock used for scheduling. The three varieties of clocks represent a
shift from an understanding of time as a commodity to an understanding that offers the possibility
of becoming “ present, connected, and grounded in the world ” [The Present, 2023b]. Looking at the
testimonials from users who have lived and experienced the artwork, they point to their new sense
of scale, proportionality and perspective on time. One user explains this in the following way:
“Once one looks at something using a different paradigm, one does not conceive of it in the same way
again. Ever. Open perception and you open possibility ” [The Present, 2023c].
Likewise, Deep Time Walk “is an invitation to view the world differently ” [Deep Time Walk
C.I.C,2017a] by introducing opportunities for a better understanding of different worldviews and
encouraging participants to find ways to put these into practice. The playwright Peter Oswald
describes how, in the audio narrative, the Scientist character feels hopeless, as every action seems
harmful to the environment [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2016]. Once she embarks on a journey with the
characteroftheFool,theystartexploringanewperspectiveoftheworldand,thus,newalternatives.
The narrative concludes with a mutual realisation that we have been entangled with each other,
nature and the Earth since the beginning. The entire narration is a journey that starts with an
opposing view from the Scientist of humans as sources of destruction and confusion about how we
become human from the Fool and moves to realising that we have always been entangled at the
end of the walk: “ If we wound you it is us that dies. There is no gap between us at all. We are the same
thing.” The choice to represent humans as merely a phase in the long life cycle of the Earth is a
move away from an anthropocentric take described by the exploitation and instrumentalisation
of nature. This work attempts to mitigate how “ the frictionless, atemporal instantaneity of digital
communications weakens our grasp on the structure of time ” [Bjornerud, 2018, p. 164] by presenting
an experience of deep time that brings us in tune with the rhythm of the Earth and provides an
awareness of the human impact [Martynski, 2021, p. 115].
6.4.2 Searching for Disseminating Tools. In several of the artworks, information visualisation is
the primary disseminating tool. Keeping Time presents its visualisation on a concentrated scale,
as it focuses on a few plant species. However, it shows that while there are clear patterns in the
data, the reasons behind those patterns are ambiguous. Visualisations like these need context
and to be situated in both time and place to be understood. This artwork can be considered a
data-driven design intervention that aims to represent how humans and environmental systems
are interconnected. If they are seen and understood, visualisation projects can substantially impact
ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 31, No. 6, Article 80. Publication date: December 2024.
80:32 P.Ciobanu and Y.Fernaeus
the public awareness of a subject matter [Valkanova et al., 2013], and they are important tools for
bringing different issues into public discourse. Jeremijenko, one of the creators of The Phenology
Clock, advocates for a transition from data spectator , in which viewers passively consume the
visualisation without being able to question or challenge it, to data contact sports , where there is a
more direct and interactive way to engage with and challenge the data [Agapakis, 2015]. In this
regard, Smith et al. note the potential of The Phenology Clock in encouraging those interested in
the natural world to explore nature in their local area and observe the various natural cycles and
changes occurring within that space [Smith et al., 2017].
Artworks such as The Phenology Clock ,The Present andDeep Time Walk sustain a diverse group
of users who can engage with them. The Phenology Clock sets an example for further gathering
data on natural systems and developing technologies that make these data accessible for those
without advanced environmental scientific training, such as designers, who can further use the data
and technologies in their own work [Smith et al., 2017].The Present is aimed towards users across
generations, while the creators of Deep Time Walk have made efforts to eliminate technological
barriers, such as by making the app available on older smartphones and by releasing an audiobook
version[DeepTimeWalkC.I.C, 2022b].TheyhavemadetheappaccessiblebydevelopingaMobility-
Assist mode, which can be used to listen to the narration without the need for walking [Deep
Time Walk C.I.C, 2017b]. The user can also switch to Gaiaphonic Mode to make the sound play
only on one earbud to listen to both the story and the surroundings while walking. Additional
materials in the project allow the script of the narration to be read by those unable to listen to it
and support facilitators who would like to organise a walk in their community [Deep Time Walk
C.I.C,2021b]. In this case, having the artwork in the form of mobile digital media is the factor that
extends its scope, as it first removes geographical restrictions and the need for a guide or physical
information boards [Martynski, 2021]. Second, as the app uses a recorded narrative that is played
based on the walking pace and does not use a global positioning system or the internet, it provides
a personalised experience, with the content being delivered at relevant points throughout the walk
[Martynski, 2021].
In addition to the audio narrative, Deep Time Walk offers various resources, such as visual
cards [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2022a]. At the end of the narration, the question ‘ What’s Next? ’ is
presented. The suggested links are for those who want to learn more, connect with others and
actively participate in taking positive action towards environmental change, specifically in their
local area. The creators of this experience believe that through this temporal reorientation, the
participants will be inspired to engage in positive action [Martynski, 2021, p. 115]. Given that the
walk is intended to provoke an emotional reaction from the participants, it is an approach that is
meant to provide hope and encourage them to take responsibility and act [Deep Time Walk C.I.C,
2018].
Theuseofanimation,in PranatamangsaAR ,forexample,isincreasinglydoneinsciencecommuni-
cation to present complex phenomena and temporal processes or historical and future temporalities
[Leslie and McKim, 2017, p. 208, 211]. Hand-drawn animations have been found to support personal
engagement and, consequently, a better understanding of abstract concepts, such as long-term
changes in the environment [Raupach, 2018a]. Emotion is an important aspect in this case, as it
passes through the virtual and physical layers and weaves them together [Roquet, 2016, p. 240].
Considering that the emotional side of technologies such as these is critical, it presents a signif-
icant strategy for science communication that can be used to engage the public in supporting
initiatives against climate change [Raupach, 2018a]. Each animated frame in Pranatamangsa AR
is a compressed time period and, when these frames are put together, these various periods of
time are distributed sequentially. These properties of compression and distribution are valuable for
articulating the themes these animations address [Raupach, 2018a].

6.4.3 SearchingforSignsofLife. Two artworks distinguish specific ideas on animacy. teamLab’s
work has multiple installations that portray nature as living through digital materials, such as
Universe of Water Particles on a Sacred Rock [teamLab, 2017d], which is a mixed-reality installation
that gives a sense of animacy to the rock, as if it has been “ woken up from a long sleep ” [Li,2020,
p. 71]. Similarly, in the Resonating Mt. Mifuneyama installation, the mountain is lit up and shines
brightly; then slowly, the light fades, as if the mountain is breathing [teamLab, 2018]. As visitors
move through the exhibition, many installations come to life and bring the various natural forms
into focus [Lee, 2022, p. 155]. This exhibition can be said to follow a traditional Japanese belief that
has existed at Mifuneyama for a long time, Shintoism, in which spirits or deities inhabit various
natural forms such as mountains, trees, rivers and waterfalls [Li, 2020, p. 69]. Thus, the use of light
in the installations is a reminder of this belief, enhancing the animacy of both the artwork and the
natural form.
Similarly, Deep Time Walk supports the Gaia hypothesis, developed by James Lovelock [Lovelock
1972],whichstatesthattheEarthcanbeconsidered,inacertainway,aliveduetotheself-regulating
feedback between various natural forms such as rocks, the atmosphere and water. These feedbacks
point to how the Earth has remained suitable for life throughout geological time. Through this
work, we are thus encouraged to develop a “ deep Gaia consciousness ” [Media, 2017], which involves
seeing the Earth as a living organism; this is presented as a necessary step towards dealing with
the environmental crisis. The app thus acts as a tool to remediate this disassociation between our
“animal body and the animate earth ” [Opus Earth, 2017]. There are many aspects in the design of
Deep Time Walk that frame the Earth as a living organism, such as using expressions like “ living
Earth” and “our planet evolved ”, addressing the Earth as “ lady Gaia ”, and using the pronoun she
to personify the Earth [Stibbe, 2020, p. 200]. “ The Earth is you and you are the Earth ” is expressed
during the narration, which builds towards a “ planetary ecological identity ” [Stibbe, 2020, p. 200] in
which humans are part of the living organism called the Earth; this communicates that by harming
this organism, we are harming ourselves.
TheseartworkscontrastwithinvestigationswithinHCI,whichhaveprimarilyfocusedonhuman
experiences separate from nature, as many environmental disruptions are too complex to be
reduced to human frameworks of time, e.g., calendars and clocks. Once we step away from the
dual representation of time as either objective or experiential, we can observe how other aspects
of time take shape. This is pivotal within the artworks analysed, where extending the dimensions
of time means moving beyond a techno-centric and anthropocentric perspective to one in which
a multitude of timescales co-exist and interact, such as ecological and long-term timescales that
include those of us in the now and future generations [Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022]. Taking
such a stance with the concept of time deconstructs the notion of ‘human exceptionalism’ that
further creates a gap between nature and culture, emphasising nonhumans’ role and agency in
building our worlds [Latimer and Miele, 2013].
Thus, rather than taking an apolitical stance, these projects follow a temporal gaze [Adam,2000],
i.e., they examine worlds through time and temporality in the context of environmental disruptions.
Such an approach is fundamental for cultivating attunement to these changes and finding ways to
prevent harmful occurrences through time, care and attention. Notions of time are, for instance,
fundamental to experiences of breakdown, maintenance and repair and how these can help us
rethink the relationship between technology and material contexts [Jackson, 2016].
7 Discussion
In the previous section, we presented how the ten artworks intervene in posthumanist discourses,
specifically discussing unmaking normative constructions of time and aligning with ideas of
pluralism, entanglement, and the ‘other’. The variety in how these artworks have materially

80:34 P.Ciobanu and Y.Fernaeus
presented more-than-human temporal reimaginings highlights the creative potential for further
investigations of the posthuman discourse on time in HCI. This section will discuss the four
conceptualisations of unmaking. We will also reflect on challenges and opportunities for HCI as it
converges towards unmaking and the more-than-human.
7.1 The Turn Towards Unmaking
The ten artworks are, although they are fundamentally different in form, all concerned with
changing perspectives, presenting new ideas and contrasting with the more romantic and nostalgic
explorations of time in HCI [see Spence et al., 2022], as well as with more utilitarian investigations
of usability and sustainability [e.g., Bowler et al., 2022; Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022]. They also
seemed to dismiss existing or conventional representations of time in various ways, providing
alternatives that include otherwise invisible temporalities. The interest in unpacking the topic of
time aligns with increasing concerns about how environmental disruptions affect humans and
natural ecosystems. This is a challenge for artists and interaction designers alike, but here we see
how the artists have deemed it necessary to explore different strategies to construct temporal
expressions.Byrethinkingthetraditionalwaysofmakingtime,theartistsdecentretheconventional
human ways of knowing time, being in time and designing tools for making time.
In reference to categories defined by Sabie et al. [ 2022b], we view the artists’ work as a blend
between unmaking as resistance andunmaking as material innovation . All the selected media
art projects resist the normative concepts of time, specifically clock time and human-centred
temporalities. Their assortment of temporalities spans human to nonhuman living beings and
technologies. They present novelty in their use of a variety of materials that are otherwise unusual
for common time-telling devices: tangible materials, such as the ribbons in Unequal Hours ; digital
materials, such as the extensive data used in The Room of Change ; the nature and ruins in a
natural park in A Forest Where Gods Live ; and various plant specimens pressed into powder
form in Allochronic Cycles . Following the analysis, we conceptualised four individually distinct
themes concerning how unmaking became delineated. The four themes were as follows: dissecting
temporality ,the unmaking of the singular ,unmaking as messing up andunmaking the other . They
follow a more relational reconstruction, in which standard tools and perceptions of time are
positioned at a similar level to the alternatives rather than above all the alternatives. This approach
alignswithposthumanthinkingandthemore-than-humanturningeneral,whichpresentsaswitch
from a human-centred perspective to a relational perspective, where there is no centre [Liu, 2020;
Poikolainen Rosén, 2022].
When the pluralistic qualities of time are neglected, this excludes “ certain practices, individuals,
and natures, and supports the dominance of others ” [Pschetz, 2015]. In addition to representing
timescales that are other-than-clock time, through the theme of dissecting temporality , we observed
how these artworks exemplify various alternatives for engaging and unravelling other-than-human
timescales. In tune with the proposal of temporal design [Pschetz and Bastian, 2018], the art cases
recognised the value in exploring alternative temporalities, especially when approaching the
complex challenge of climate change. On the path of deconstructing temporal multiplicity, these
worksexposehow‘thehuman’issituatedina“ multispecies affair ”inwhichallcreatureshavearole
in sustaining livability [Tsing, 2017]. They materially construct possibilities for understanding and
viewing time differently to redirect the normative human-centred realities towards a considerate
and thoughtful communion with nature.
The second theme of unmaking the singular embraces plurality, which implies that situated
knowledge takes up space and that we do so from a certain standpoint when making knowl-
edge. When multiple perspectives are combined, we reach a stronger understanding of the world.
Transitioning from the singular to a plural perspective acknowledges a wide variety of similarly

Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:35
valuable ways to examine reality. This aligns with the tension between defuturing , in which the
modern unsustainability that shatters possible futures is considered, and futuring , which presents
the possibility of having a plurality of futures, which Fry uses as an argument to move towards
sustainment that would allow for these multiple futures, i.e., thinking, doing, being, to exist: “ while
the planet is singular, world is plural—for it is formed and seen in difference—as are we ” [Fry,2014].
More than that, we consider how the artworks, while they are different in various ways, are still
connected in terms of materials, representation, or experience when engaging with pluralism, thus
following Escobar’s concept of the pluriverse as a “ world where many worlds fit ” [Escobar, 2018].
Specifically, they possess the fractalquality of the pluriverse: “ anywhere you look at it, and at any
scale, you find similar (yet not the same) configurations, meshes, assemblages … that is, the pluriverse ”
[Escobar, 2018, p. 257].
For the theme of unmaking as messing up , we unravelled connections of knowledge, approaches,
and relations of a more-than-human nature. We understand entanglements, as explained by Barad,
as “not intertwinings of separate entities, but rather irreducible relations of responsibility ” [Barad,
2010]. For example, while Unequal Hours materially entangles clocks, the temporalities embedded
into each clock are dissimilar. The clocks that are connected to each other are entangled through
relations of “‘self’ and ‘other,’ ‘past’ and ‘present’ and ‘future,’ ‘here’ and ‘now,’ ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ ”
[Barad,2010]. Some artworks presented a physical and tangible form of such entanglements. This
wasexplicitlyshownin UnequalHours ,withthephysicaltensionsofribbonsrepresentingthepower
of certain timescales over others. These also represented co-dependencies through the connections
of clocks with the tangled ribbons. The possibility of the ribbons getting tangled to the extent that
the clocks stop moving is analogous to how various environmental processes become disarranged
by environmental disruptions. Other cases, such as Deep Time Walk , bound the entire experience
with the artwork to show how these relationships and dependencies have been built.
The final theme of unmaking the other followed the understanding of entanglements from Barad,
with ‘otherness’ understood as an “ entangled relation of difference ” [Barad, 2010], which points to
how beings are distinct while remaining connected. We thus engaged with unmaking the ‘other’ by
presenting how seemingly separate perspectives, materials, and beings collectively create realities
that are more than the sum of their parts. This aligns with Laurel’s proposals of “ Technology is not
the other ” and “Nature is not the other ” for a Gaian IxD based on a perspective that at every scale,
the systems that sustain life, both biological and technological, are interrelated [Laurel, 2011].
While unmaking can be violent and destructive, we view the artworks as presenting a gentle
unmaking : rather than removing, they question, dissect, and present alternatives. For example, in
pieces such as Unequal Hours ,Allochronic Cycles ,Pranatamangsa AR ,Deep Time Walk , andThe
Room of Change , human timescales are a component of the artwork; they are represented through
clocks of the rhythms of the human body, the Anthropocene as a division of a disc, agricultural
activities in ecological calendars, the time that Homo Sapiens has been on Earth, and society as a
data visualisation topic, respectively. What is more, The Present is introduced as a ‘complementary
addition’ to existing clock time artefacts rather than a replacement. For this reason, the works
may initially seem apolitical, yet they appear to purposefully muddythe discourse on time. As
we mentioned before, understandings of time, like clock time, are presented in a clean, objective,
andnon-muddy manner, detached from the material and experiential aspects of the world. Such a
perspective is harmful, as it perpetuates possibilities that can only be perceived and understood
through this singular lens. Despite the seemingly untroubled aesthetics of the artworks, they
materially or conceptually engaged with the muddiness andmessiness that result from unmaking.
Materially, this is exemplified through embodied and immersive experiences like Deep Time Walk
andA Forest Where Gods Live that call for engagement that is more unpredictable and unstructured,
as the natural spaces affect the experience, or through the literal use of plant species turned to

powder to represent the “ dust of the cosmos ” for the disc presenting the cycle of the cosmos in
Allochronic Cycles . Conceptually, the four themes indicate that the different forms of unmaking
aim to muddle, entangle, and complicate within the more-than-human agenda.
7.2 Challenges and Opportunities for HCI
The two intersecting fields of HCI and media art are interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and
very much so by nature. Competing research interests often need to be “ backed by other subject
specialist areas such as fine art, technology, anthropology, computing and economics ” [Dykes et al.,
2009]. Each analysed artwork can be seen to represent a collaboration between the art, science, and
technology disciplines. In this case, the fields are challenged by the “ translational ” work [Giannachi,
2012] needed to transfer the practice or concept from one discipline to another. According to Rapp
et al. [2022], much of the work in HCI on time makes use of theoretical frameworks that originated
in other fields, but the theory is either only partly applied or important insights are ‘lost’ during
the transfer. Following the media art cases presented in this paper, we see how each work stems
from a particular idea of time, with specific material expressions developing from there. This is
perhaps most explicit in the naming of the artworks, e.g., Allochronic Cycles ,Unequal Hours ,The
Present,Deep Time Walk , andThe Phenology Clock . We see how further research could benefit from
taking a diffractive [Barad, 2007] approach in which the theoretical starting point superimposes
a collection of interactive designs, and by analysing its diversity, we can address the emerging
patterns of difference [Britton et al., 2019].
Another notable aspect to those working in HCI is the development of a “ a posthumanist
sensibility ” [Rahm-Skågeby and Rahm, 2022]. This argues for a move from the self to a collective
experience and social and environmental commitments. The co-founder and executive director of
Deep Time Walk , Robert Woodford, acknowledges that the individual character of the experience
somewhat contradicts the long-term goal of the project [Martynski, 2021, p. 139]. Similarly, The
Present - Year indicates a holistic view of time that aims to resemble changes determined by nature
whilealso,throughtheembodimentofaclock,pointingtotheindividualinrelationtothecollective.
Thus, this functioning artwork presented alternatives within the realm of time-keeping rather
than explicitly focusing on social togetherness. The collective quality emerges when communities
organise deep time walks or when The Present clocks stir conversations when they are noticed by
others. The Phenology Clock is proposed to be introduced to communities as an activity to allow
them to learn about their local urban species and attune to the temporalities within that place.
From an HCI perspective, a reflection concerning this could be developing designs that inherently
require a social aspect rather than being introduced to an existing community. Regarding the social
as inherent to any interactive experience is thus an important reflection obtained from analysing
these media artworks, which may also bring value to interaction design more broadly.
OneparticularconnectiontocontemporaryHCIdiscourseishowtheworksrepresentatransition
from concern to action. Having a perspective different from human exceptionalism is associated
with a relationship with the natural world that is less exploitative and instrumentative. However,
ecocriticism reminds us to be mindful that a reformed perspective is insufficient to drive action
towards a more environmentally and socially just future or to adjust our ways of living to be more
in tune with nature [Clark, 2015, p. 18]. Nevertheless, we unpacked how the artworks supported
beliefs in various ways. In addition to providing a rethinking of time, the pieces pointed towards
nature-culture interdependencies in Keeping Time , local natural patterns in The Phenology Clock ,
the various entanglements between humans and their natural environments in The Room of Change ,
and connections of the past, present, and future between human and geological timescales in Deep
Time Walk . Furthermore, Deep Time Walk used a creative approach to present how we are all
“part of a wider web of sacred life ”, seeing the Earth as an extension of our bodies with whom we

Material Deconstructions of Time: Posthumanist InterventionsThroughMedia Art 80:37
symbiotically cohabitate [Mowe, 2017] rather than a suggestion of human exceptionalism [Deep
Time Walk C.I.C, 2018].
While designs that support reflection and change our self-understanding as agents are relevant,
there is a need for designs that can shift our behaviour and how we interact with the world in
practice. One way to do this is through roadmaps that provide instructions on how to take action,
as inDeep Time Walk ’s ‘What’s Next?’ Another strategy is that of transitional arts practice [Neal,
2016],whichisbuilton“ the experience of artistic practice in the context of current global challenges, to
make collective space to create a new narrative of change ”; this could take the form of designed tools
and other resources. This is thus an opportunity to create geographically specific and culturally
nuanced designs. For example, The Present - Year could be personalised to the characteristics of the
seasons in a specific part of the world, considering that many ‘deviations’ from the standard ‘four
seasons’ exist. Designs can also include functionalities that connect people to their local groups,
such as in Deep Time Walk ; with these groups, they can access tools and resources to act and apply
unharmful practices. To support networks and relations on broader and global levels, these designs
could also include options for sharing, such as taking a walk through deep time with a far-away
friend, following the phenology clock of your native land, or creating physical entanglements of
the human and nonhuman temporalities that we encounter throughout our lives. Other alternatives
could be creating discursive objects meant to be experienced with others, whether this occurs in an
exhibition setting or in other types of locations.
Unlocking the creative potential through artistic practice is currently linked to “ reconnecting
with our deep nature of creative beings by urgency” [Deep Time Walk C.I.C, 2017a]. Taking creative
pathways allows various dialogues to take place and, as a result, become a site of transformation
[Martynski, 2021, p. 179]. This creative engagement with challenges, such as the impact of the
Anthropocene on the Earth, contrasts with more didactic approaches that focus on teaching and
persuasion, which have been shown to have a low effect in terms of engaging or moving audiences
[Crossick and Kasznska, 2016, p. 65]. Considering that through imagination, we can envision
possible futures and find ways to make these futures happen, the ideas and stories disseminated
in relation to climate change affect how we approach this challenge. Various media can be used
to give form to and creatively tell a story. This brings opportunities to uncover abstract notions
of time that are usually left undetected but are nevertheless essential to understand. This is the
case when one uses the type of technology that helps bridge the gap between virtual and natural
environments and supports a more immersive experience for the visitors [Lee, 2022, p. 155], as in A
Forest Where Gods Live . With virtual environments becoming increasingly realistic, the embodied
interaction can further impact and shape the experience [Li, 2020, p. 79]. In combination with
specific events/stories, it is also a great example of connecting bigger and smaller dimensions for
us to relate to each other. The concept of an ‘art exhibition’ is also an exciting example of embodied
interaction, especially in mixed-reality environments in which “ the sensual qualities of a real nature
and the steerable ones of a digitized nature ” are simultaneously present [Li, 2020, p. 79]. Animation
can also draw attention to the “ unpredictable and unobservable aspects of environmental change
that is spatially and temporally distant from everyday life ” [Raupach, 2018a], as inPranatamangsa
AR. As it brings out these alternative temporalities and clears certain abstract notions of time, it
becomes a relevant tool for various scientific disciplines that require forms of representing change
and transformation, e.g., climate science [Society for Animation Studies Conference, 2018, p. 112].
8 Conclusions
Wehavepresentedananalysisofaselectionoftenmediaartworksconcernedwiththeunmakingor
deconstruction of established notions of time and temporality. The artworks are analysed in align-
ment with contemporary theories in posthuman discourses, highlighting their explicit engagement

with notions of plurality, entanglement, bodies, and materiality. We conceptualised four themes
through which unmaking was represented in these contexts: dissecting temporality ,the unmaking
of the singular ,unmaking as messing up , andunmaking the other . We see several implications or
ways that this analysis could inspire interaction designers. First, transitioning from the singular
perspective to a plural perspective of time acknowledges a wide diversity of ways to examine
reality beyond what is standard or provided in a given material context, welcoming alternatives
suited for specific places, uses, or cultures. Second, entanglement points to time as relational, social,
and interconnected, a perspective from which many promising design projects could evolve. Third,
presenting how seemingly separate perspectives, doings, and beings collectively create realities
opens up broader notions of what or who is included as a user or actor in a designed system. Finally,
the analysis emphasises how the artworks materially illustrate possibilities for understanding
and viewing time differently, thereby deconstructing established forms of representing tempo-
rality. However, rather than being violent and destructive or fundamentally disrupting existing
systems or representational forms, the selected artworks represented a gentle unmaking , focusing
on adding, questioning, or presenting alternatives. Nevertheless, as with the process of unmaking,
an inevitable deliberate and desired mess happens as a result. Considering how unmaking aims to
muddle binaries and harmful standards within the posthuman discord, the selected artworks aim to
do the same. They purposefully make a mess out of the clear and structured world created by clock
time, with the four themes representing how unmaking emerges. We thus see several opportunities
for HCI based on the above study, in terms of both concrete design inspiration and theoretical
implications. We derive from the media artworks theoretical beginnings that are different from the
norm, i.e. phenology instead of clock time, that generate an array of designs that can provide the
alternatives called for to further advance HCI work on time and posthumanism. These alternatives
should be situated in time and place, include practices that do not harm nature, support immersive
experiences,andconnectuserstolocalgroupswheretheworkcanbefurtherdeveloped.Challenges
remain regarding how to bring forth inherent social qualities, focus more on the collective than on
the individual, and shift from concern to action.
