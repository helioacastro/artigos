Economic growth ABSTRACT  
As the planet moves further into the human-induced Anthropocene there is an urgent need to reconsider the 
values, practices, and politics leading to widespread ecological degradation. The prioritisation of economic 
growth by the most dominant political institutions encourages limitless expansion while minimizing awareness 
of the ecological vulnerability of the planet. Commoning presents an alternative political structure based on 
transformative practices of collective care or caring with. In this paper, we investigate how communities in 
Skouries of Halkidiki, Greece, are responding to the imposition of large-scale mining through three different 
commons initiatives. The women ’s collective, the chamomile commons, and the ten-day festival. These commons 
provide insights into how instances of caring with performed by human and nonhuman others are the foundations 
of local place-based politics. We argue that already existing examples of commoning and caring with can make 
visible a more fitting politics for the Anthropocene that can benefit decision-making at national and international 
levels.

1.Introduction 
Progress is often presented as synonymous with the pursuit of eco-
nomic growth, as illustrated in the quote above. Earth system scientists, 
however, are concerned that this pursuit, above all else, is driving the 
planet out of the climatically stable Holocene epoch, which stretches 
back to the beginnings of settled agriculture some 12,000 years ago, into 
a new much more unstable and dynamic geological epoch called the 
Anthropocene (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000 ; Hamilton, 2013 ). The 
Anthropocene is a geological term that has been proposed to signify a 
shift in the geological record that reflects the rapid transformation of the 
Earth by human activities since the mid-twentieth Century (Zalasiewicz 
et al., 2011 ). Often referred to as the Great Acceleration, the post-war 
period has become associated with an unrelenting assault on environmental systems oriented at extracting economic value to fuel 
human development. This has benefited wealthier countries and classes 
much more than others, while simultaneously contributing to over-
lapping crises for all, including climate change, biodiversity loss, the 
proliferation of novel entities like synthetic chemicals and microplastics, 
and the alteration of biochemical cycles such as nitrogen and phos-
phorus cycles (Steffen et al., 2015 ). While some ecomodernists suggest 
that a “good Anthropocene ” may still be possible through improved 
environmental stewardship and technological advancement, others 
have called for a fundamental rethink of the anthropocentric, individ -
ualistic and extractivist values and systems that underpin the endless 
pursuit of economic growth (e.g. Haraway, 2016 ). In this paper we 
contribute to such a rethinking by analysing how caring with and com-
moning are emerging as alternative sets of values and practices that can 
contribute to politics in the Anthropocene (Richardson et al., 2023 ). 
We approach the Anthropocene with great concern due to the 
widespread human and nonhuman suffering associated with planetary 
degradation. However, like Donna Haraway (2016) we are hopeful that 
debates around the new epoch can help us cultivate new “imaginable 
epochs ” based on different forms of place-based politics that challenge

2the hyper-separation of humans from nonhumans (Gibson-Graham, 
2011) and reflect much more diverse sets of norms and values than those 
that pursue economic growth. While others have focused upon the ideal 
political institutions best suited for the Anthropocene (e.g. Dryzek & 
Pickering, 2019; Eckersley, 2018; Latour, 2004) here we explore the 
already existing forms of local politics that are emerging to accompany 
the new epoch. To do so we borrow from Doreen Massey’s (2005, 99) 
conceptualization of globalization as “made in places” and that “not only 
is the local constructed out of the global, but the global is constructed 
from the local”. We similarly position the Anthropocene epoch as being 
the accumulation of local political decisions and processes, such as 
clearfelling a forest, allowing a coal mine to go ahead or permitting a 
new feedlot to be built. In other words, we recognize that the Anthro -
pocene is constituted by place-based politics, which include the many 
and diverse forms of oppositional values and relations that have 
emerged to resist and contest ecological destruction. 
Species and planetary scales of thinking tend to dominate Anthro -
pocene debates as local expressions of resistance are too often “off- 
staged by so many storylines and narratives” (Swyngedouw & Ernstson, 
2018). However, we see place-based resistance being as much a feature 
of the Anthropocene epoch as the accumulation of CO2 in the atmo -
sphere. Just as Massey (2005) encourages “other” and “alternative” 
globalisations to proliferate, here we nurture awareness of alternative 
Anthropocenes, where the focus is not only upon the local and global 
impacts of planetary change but also upon the place-based political 
actions and more-than-human relations that have arisen to contest and 
resist the developments contributing to those changes. We see this 
pathway as hopeful and constructive and focus here on forms of resis-
tance enacted through care and commoning to prevent a gold mine 
proposal in Greece. While it is only one of many diverse struggles 
occurring around the world, each of which will reflect their own his-
tories and cultures, it provides a glimpse into alternative sets of values 
and politics that prioritise local communities and relations. 
Following Gibson-Graham and colleagues we are interested in care 
and commoning as political responses to the Anthropocene (Gibson- -
Graham et al., 2016). Care is both a practice and an ethics, defined by 
Tronto and Fisher (1991, p. 40) as “a species of activity that includes 
everything we do to maintain, contain, and repair our ’world’ so that we 
can live in it as well as possible”. Tronto (1993, p. 127) identifies five 
phases of care: 
caring about, noticing the need to care in the first place; taking care 
of, assuming responsibility for care; care-giving, the actual work of 
care that needs to be done; and care-receiving, the response of that 
which is cared for to the care. 
The fifth phrase, caring with, recognises the ways care can be prac-
ticed through mutual relations of solidarity (Tronto, 2013). Care is a 
central practice that reproduces and sustains commons (Gibson-Graham 
et al., 2013; Parris & Williams, 2019). 
We understand commons to be everyday collective practices and 
relations produced by communities of human and nonhumans (Bresni -
han, 2016a; Gibson et al., 2015; Grear, 2020; Parris & Williams, 2019; 
Williams, 2018; Zapata Campos et al., 2020). Such an understanding 
recognises that commons are brought into being through practices of 
collective care (Singh, 2017) that are enabled and enacted through the 
more-than-human relations emerging from place (Bresnihan, 2016a; 
Gibson et al., 2015; Grear, 2020; Parris & Williams, 2019; Zapata 
Campos et al., 2020). We approach commons both as socio-natural 
processes (Karagianni, 2023), meaning social constructions formed 
around the relations specific humans develop with the material envi-
ronment around them, and as laboratories that can enrich our political 
institutions with a variety of values and cultivate new understandings 
through the acceptance of pluralism (Ostrom, 2015). 
To explore these ideas further, this paper examines community op-
position to a large-scale gold mining proposal for Skouries of Halkidiki, 
Greece. The paper first delves into the literatures on care and commoning, illuminating the opportunities enabled by shifting from a 
politics based on economic growth to a politics focused on collective 
care. We position the gold mining proposal as an example of the 
extractive politics that has contributed to the Anthropocene, based on 
caring about economic growth. We then outline our case study meth -
odology before examining three examples of commoning that have 
emerged through practices of caring with human and nonhuman others. 
Through these examples, we explore how caring and commoning have 
become more active and visible at the local scale as the mining proposal 
looms. We then reflect upon the political potentials and limitations of 
these activities and their possible contribution to a more caring 
Anthropocene. 
2.Conceptualising caring with 
Care is considered a “species activity” (Tronto & Fisher, 1991) and 
practice that is as Power (2019, p. 765) notes, “central to human exis-
tence”. As an ethics and practice, care has become a conceptual focus of 
geographers concerned with the possibility of caring cities (Power & 
Williams, 2020; Williams, 2016, 2020); infrastructures (Alam & Hous -
ton, 2020; Power et al., 2022; Williams & Tait, 2022); food systems 
(Abbots et al., 2016; Beacham, 2018); economies (Diprose, 2017; 
Dombroski et al., 2019); housing (Power & Bergan, 2019; Power & Mee, 
2020); more-than-human connections (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015; 
2017); and commons (Bresnihan, 2016; Singh, 2017). Recent scholar -
ship has recognised how care is practiced for human and 
more-than-human others, and with materials and things (Power & 
Williams, 2020). 
In this paper we focus on caring with as a performative and ethical 
disposition or ideal which has the potential to challenge the dominant 
value of economic growth, as epitomized in the gold mine proposal, as 
the best economic route for improving collective well-being. Tronto 
(2017) has argued that caring with can disrupt the usual rationale behind 
how we define the premises of living well by moving away from on-
tologies that position humans as homo-economicus towards an under -
standing of humans as homines curans. Instead of thinking of humans as 
autonomous rational individuals who seek to maximize individual 
wealth, caring with starts with the premise that people and nonhumans 
are relationally connected and reliant upon one another for their col-
lective survival (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017). Care, as an ethics, is 
founded on a “relational social ontology, understanding our world in 
terms of the connections that bind us together” (Lawson, 2007, p. 4). 
Within this frame, caring with reflects an ideal form of care where 
alternative values can flourish, challenging political priorities based on 
maximizing economic growth, to instead recognize our collective re-
sponsibilities to and for care (Mcdowell, 2004; Power & Williams, 2020; 
Sevenhuijsen, 1998, 2003; Tronto, 2015, 2017; Williams, 2020). 
Caring with also challenges the idea that relations between humans 
and nonhumans should be measured by their economic value (Lawrence 
& Churn, 2012; Lefebvre, 2004; Schrader, 2012; Smith, 2001). Practices 
that occur outside the formal economic domain such as cleaning and 
cooking, and taking care of children and the elderly are valuable prac-
tices of caring and contribute to wellbeing more broadly defined (Gib-
son-Graham et al., 2013). Practices of solidarity, conviviality, empathy, 
trust, mutual aid, and reciprocity are forms of caring labor (Federici, & 
Beatriz, 2014; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017). Such practices have long been 
documented by diverse economies scholars as vital to social reproduc -
tion and as economic practices that sustain life (Gibson-Graham et al., 
2013). Caring with provides a conceptual umbrella that recognises 
humans and nonhuman others as co-constructors of everyday worlds 
through practices of care (Barad, 2003; Bennett, 2010; Bresnihan, 
2016a, 2016b; Escobar, 2018; Murray Li, 2007; Power, 2019). Under 
this framing the much-touted economic benefits of the gold mine can be 
contrasted with the already-existing but less visible forms of caring with. 
Moreover, caring with can be used to inform and interpret political 
strategies emerging in the Anthropocene. In Skouries of Halkidiki one I. Rigkos-Zitthen et al.

3such strategy is commoning. 
3.Commoning as the embodiment of caring with 
Commoning is positioned as a form of caring with by Parris and 
Williams (2019, p. 535) who argue that “commons can be understood as 
sites of caring with that are cared for by a collective who shares re-
sponsibility for care”. The concept of commons was most famously 
examined by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom (2015) who used the term to 
refer to the collective governance of finite natural resources. Thousands 
of documented case studies have since shown how different commu -
nities collectively manage natural resources often referred to as common 
pool resources or environmental commons (Ostrom, 2015). These re-
sources include the ocean and the atmosphere (Gibson-Graham et al., 
2016), fisheries, and meadows (Bresnihan, 2016b), co-housing (Huron, 
2015), forest management (Agrawal, 2003; Murray Li, 2007), national 
parks, and irrigation system management (Ostrom, 2015). 
A more recent approach to commons, defines them as constituted 
through practices of commoning, particularly care-full commoning 
(Bresnihan, 2016b; Gibson et al., 2015; Gibson-Graham, 2008; Gib-
son-Graham et al., 2013, 2016; Grear, 2020; Parris & Williams, 2019; 
Williams, 2018). As Linebaugh (2008, p. 279) explains, 
to speak of commons as resources (material or immaterial) is 
misleading at best and dangerous at worst. The common is an ac-
tivity, and it expresses relationships in a society that are inseparable 
from relations to nature. 
Linebaugh suggests using the word commons as a verb 
—commoning— which involves understanding commons through an 
analysis of practices and the relations between socio-material agents 
(Bresnihan, 2016b; Gibson et al., 2015; Gibson-Graham, 2008; Gib-
son-Graham et al., 2013, 2016; Grear, 2020; Parris & Williams, 2019; 
Williams, 2018). Adopting such a lens means understanding commons 
as constituted primarily by the relational and performative praxis of 
commoning amongst communities, which include other-than-humans. 
Commons understood as reproduced through practices of commoning 
have been studied as community land trusts (Huron, 2015), housing 
cooperatives (Noterman, 2016), autonomous spaces (Bresnihan & 
Byrne, 2015), community gardens (Eizenberg, 2012), and community 
organisations (Parris & Williams, 2019) amongst others. Practices of 
caring are important for reproducing commons (Gibson-Graham et al., 
2013). Parris and Williams (2019, p. 534) note that “for commons to be 
sustained and maintained, practices of care are crucial to their continued 
existence”. In their study of a community organization that included a 
community garden, they illustrate how commons are constituted by a 
community of human and nonhuman others who care with, for, and 
about the commons and argue that caring practices can be both inten -
tional and unintentional, as more-than-human others are enrolled in 
practices of caring with and for the commons. 
Commoning may help to cultivate a radical ethos essential for poli-
tics in the Anthropocene through collective management of material 
and/or immaterial wealth (Gibson-Graham et al., 2016). We recognize 
that the way different agents care through commoning is unequal and 
messy (McFarlane, 2009; Nightingale, 2019; Parris & Williams, 2019; 
Power, 2019; Williams, 2020). As Noterman (2016) notes, those who 
participate more in commons whilst taking on more responsibility can 
also receive greater benefits. Moreover, the benefits produced through 
commons can be distributed more widely than those participating in 
commoning practices specifically (Gibson-Graham et al., 2013). Com-
moning comes with its challenges in terms of access to decision-making 
and fair distribution of benefits but as Gibson-Graham et al. (2016, p. 4) 
suggest, commoning may assist us in “reimagining our ways of living on 
this planetary home” and our responsibility to nonhuman others. Those 
who common do so with others, and might be driven by and cultivate 
different logics and values such as solidarity, mutual aid, and empathy, 
reproducing other ways of being, doing, and thinking worlds (Williams, 2018). In this study, for example, we show how the benefits from forms 
of commoning oriented at opposing the gold mine extend to the eco-
nomic, environmental, and social sustainability of the broader local 
community. 
Commoning practices differ across space reflecting societies, cul-
tures, and environments, each with their strengths, weaknesses, values, 
and priorities. Care, also always practiced relationally, is an important 
practice that reproduces commons, as actors care for, with, about, and 
through commons in diverse ways. In the following section, we outline 
the case study and the methodological approach before exploring the 
particular forms of commoning that have emerged in Skouries of Hal-
kidiki. We position this case study as emerging in response to the (il) 
logics that are driving Anthropocene change, identifying forms of caring 
with that underpin and inspire oppositional politics. 
4.Case study and methodological approach 
Skouries of Halkidiki is in the Aristotle municipality of Greece and 
has a long history of small-scale mining, tourism, agriculture, and fish-
ing. When the economic crisis hit Greece in 2010 the Canadian mining 
company Eldorado Gold approached the Greek government and pro-
posed a gold mine in the region to help the nation pay off its public debt 
to global lenders, including the European Central Bank, the European 
Commission, and the International Monetary Fund (Meynen, 2019). 
Conservative and social democratic parties similarly presented 
large-scale mining to help the country escape the debt loop and bring 
substantial economic growth to the country (C.C. C. of Ierissos, 2019). 
The priority for these political parties was economic growth as a 
response to mounting debt within the country. The main beneficiaries of 
the mining investment were the mining company whose goal was to 
extract as much economic profit as possible, the Greek state, through 
taxation, and Greece’s global lenders which expected the Greek state 
return the money they lent the country, including interest. Local miners 
were not expecting to receive large amounts of income from the mine 
but would receive wages. 
Concerns emerged amongst local populations around Skouries as 
they became aware of the adverse effects of large-scale mining (C. C. C. 
of Ierissos, 2019). An anti-mining group started raising concerns about 
the negative impacts the mine expansion would have on public health, 
the environment, and local economic activities such as fishing, 
beekeeping, farming, and social cohesion (SoSHalkidiki, 2013). Ten-
sions between supporters of mining and those wanting to preserve their 
current way of living emerged. Various national governments have come 
and gone since the announcement, with conservative parties largely 
favoring the mine and leftist parties opposing it. However, plans for the 
mine have progressed, even when the leftist SYRIZA party came to 
power in 2015 with a commitment to stop the mine, as they found it 
difficult to halt the economic momentum. The region, including the 
areas of anti-mining supporters in Aristotle municipality, that formed to 
contest the mine can be seen in Fig. 1. 
To explore the commoning practices that have emerged to contest 
the mine the first author conducted fieldwork in Greece from the start of 
2019 until the beginning of 2020 using a range of qualitative methods as 
part of their PhD research project supervised by a project team that 
included authors two and three. All fieldwork was conducted and 
completed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Macυ 
(2020). The research aimed to understand how and why commoning 
came to be practiced around Skouries. In total, 40 people from Ierissos 
and Megali Panagia participated in face-to-face semi-structured in-
terviews, five focus groups with 4 people were held, and five group 
meetings were observed through participant observation. Study partic -
ipants were selected through snowball sampling, beginning with 
prominent anti-mine activists identified through the internet. Interviews 
and focus groups were conducted in Greek, translated, and transcribed 
by the first author fluent in Greek and English. Observations were 
recorded in a field diary and provided supplementary understandings of I. Rigkos-Zitthen et al.

4the role and activities of different commons in Skouries. The plurality of 
methods helped reveal different types of commoning practices, 
providing opportunities for people to communicate privately, in a 
group, or through existing organisations. Data was analysed to under -
stand why different commoning activities began, the impacts on com-
moning participants and their political activities, practices of caring with, 
and the role of nonhumans actors as explored in the following sections. 
4.1. The Skouries mining project 
The Skouries mining project has a 25-year lifespan and began con-
struction in 2011 (Eldorado Gold, 2011 ). It is driven by the Canadian 
mining company Eldorado Gold and its Greek subsidiary Ellynikos 
Hrisos. It is criticised for top-down decision-making processes that do 
not take the local populations ’ concerns about the health implications, 
environmental degradation, and social cohesion impacts of the mine 
into consideration (Papada, 2014 ). For Eldorado Gold to maximize value 
from its investment, it needs to reshape and transform the landscape by 
removing all socio-material relations that block the operation of mining 
(Eldorado Gold, 2018 , p. 171). This change in ‘land use’ has far-reaching 
economic, social, and health impacts (SoSHalkidiki, 2013 ). We refer to 
this process as “smoothening ”, following the terminology the mining 
company is using to describe its productive activity (Eldorado Gold, 
2018 ). Smoothening aims to eliminate the social and ecological diversity 
around Skouries that may interfere with their pursuit of profit. In doing 
so the mine is contributing not only to local ecological degradation but is 
also one of many places in the world whose cumulative decision making 
and impacts are contributing to Anthropocene change. 
To facilitate greater productivity the company has removed large 
swathes of forest to facilitate mining. Deforestation raises a multitude of 
environmental concerns including effecting the local microclimate and 
causing habitat loss (Environmental Council of Aristotle University of 
Thessaloniki, 2012 ). Technology is also being used to remove the water 
inside the mountain because underground waters disturb the extractive 
process for gold and copper (Eldorado Gold, 2018 ). The mine requires a 
dry environment where metals can be isolated from liquids and gases 
(Eldorado Gold, 2018 ; Panayiotopoulos, 2017 ). An interview with KP 
explains: “for the mining company to access the metals, miners first need 
to drill holes all across the mountain to drain the underground waters ” (Interview KP, December 11, 2019). The plan is for the mountain to be 
shaped like a giant filter to enable valuable metal extraction at the 
expense of local social and ecological systems. 
The ecological systems affected by deforestation and mountain 
drilling are very delicate and extremely difficult to restore (Environ -
mental Council of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2012 ). Under -
ground waters carry minerals and metals important for the sustainability 
of micro and macro ecosystems including plants, animals, and humans 
(Benos, 2012 ). Without the underground waters, plants will be unable to 
flourish and feed the local animal population (Aristotle University of 
Environmental Council of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2012 ). 
Without food, animals will be forced to move away disturbing the 
ecological balance (Lykos, 2020 ). Human communities are also affected 
since many activities like beekeeping, tourism, and forestry are reliant 
upon the forest. 
Despite these impacts, many people remain supportive of the mining 
expansion (Velegrakis, 2015 ). The long history of mining in the region is 
fondly described by one interview participant, who explained that 
“when a kid is born, the wish they give him is to grow with a lamp on his 
forehead ” (Interview AP, May 4, 2019). However, never has a gold mine 
of this scale been attempted before in the area. The scale of the proposal 
threatens non-mining livelihoods that have previously co-existed with 
small-scale mining activities. To quell potential opposition the mining 
company has become active within communities, a standard strategy 
mining companies use to increase acceptance amongst local populations 
(Wall & Pelon, 2011 ). 
An example is the Christmas village in Stratoni village (Fig. 2). The 
Christmas village was funded by Eldorado Gold and created by volun -
teers from the mining community to bring joy and teach children about 
local traditions. It assists in communicating the benefits mining brings to 
the local community and provides an avenue for the mine to build good 
public relations, show social responsibility and facilitate connections to 
people not working in mining (Dousis, 2017 ). This positioning was 
reproduced through mainstream media which fostered an image of 
Stratoni ’s Christmas Village as having significant positive impacts for 
the local community (Dousis, 2017 ). 
Initiatives like the Stratoni Christmas village disrupt simple narra -
tives that pitch a destructive mining company against a vulnerable local 
community by positioning the company as caring. The mining

5company ’s primary goal is the creation of profit for shareholders. The 
company also cares for its workers and the communities supported by 
the mine through sponsorship, investment, and providing local 
employment. Similarly, workers and dependent communities care for 
the mine. One interview participant explained that “some miners un-
derstand the destructive character large-scale mining has, but they also 
must feed their families. It is all about priorities ” (Interview TP, May 15, 
2019). The forms of care being expressed are, however, partial to the 
employees and shareholders, with little concern shown for the humans 
and nonhumans negatively affected by the mine, and it is from these 
disaffected groups that forms of resistance have emerged. Central to that 
resistance have been commoning activities bound together by the 
practices of caring with. 
4.2. Care and commoning around Skouries 
In this section, we explore three examples of commoning as practices 
of caring with. The first case study examines a form of commoning, the 
chamomile commons, that is threatened by smoothening processes 
associated with the mine. Existing socioecological relations and diverse 
ecological communities are being erased to make way for single-use, and 
ultimately disposable, mining landscape. Those involved in the cham -
omile commons value the practices of caring with chamomile above any 
economic benefits associated with the mine. The second two examples 
explored are the women ’s collective and the ten-day festival, which are 
forms of commoning that emerged to resist this smoothening process. 
Here commoning has come to be practiced as a form of collective 
resistance to protect existing socioecological landscapes by disrupting 
and challenging the processes and narratives of economic growth and 
mining. We trace these existing diverse and active place-based values 
and practices to make them more visible and considerable when 
thinking through political responses to the Anthropocene. The first 
example is the Chamomile Commons. 
4.2.1. Chamomile commons 
One day, I went to collect wild chamomile on Kakavos mountain near 
Skouries gold mine. Then an old lady saw me and told me: “stop, you 
are hurting them! ” I did not know how to respond to that …” The old 
lady then explained to me: “You know, there is a special way that you 
need to cut the root of the flower. But before that, you must sing to it 
and inform it that its life is precious. You have to show that you care 
for it (Interview ANI, 4/3/2019). The participant describes a small-scale commoning activity formed 
around collecting chamomile on the mountain near Skouries (Fig. 3). 
The fertile mineral soil of Kakavos mountain is an ideal area for col-
lecting chamomile. In this example, the chamomile is positioned as an 
agent endowed with personality, agency, and subjectivity that is 
deserving of care. The chamomile commons is comprised of old farmers 
and plant collectors, the chamomile, the water, the soil minerals, cutting 
tools, as well as techniques that sustain a local economy and livelihoods. 
Public healthcare is not widely available and easily accessible in the 
region. Collecting chamomile is an activity that involves people who use 
the healing botanical properties of the plant to care for themselves and 
others. It helps them to survive through a local community economy 
(Gibson & Dombroski, 2020 ). People draw on the botanical life of 
chamomile to remedy some basic inflammatory conditions. The cham -
omile offers healing and therapeutical properties in return for the care of 
those involved in the chamomile commons. Moreover, plants like 
chamomile enable people to develop local knowledges that the modern 
pharmaceutical industry seems to have only recently utilized (Pet-
rovska, 2012 ). 
Decisions and practices involved in the collection of the chamomile 
are governed by a series of norms that are in tune with seasons and care 
for and with the plant. Each human member of the commons respects 
chamomile life cycles, and operates under collective decision-making 
which follows the seasonal rythmes of the plant. Around Skouries for-
est, chamomile is collected by a community that harvests and tends to 
the chamomile every spring and summer. For centuries people have 
grown to be attentive and careful to the plant ’s needs. A chamomile 
collector must wait for spring and summer to harvest the plant or risk 
failure and degradation. This anticipation gives space and time for many 
nonhuman species to flourish. Forest chamomile requires special 
attention and care to grow every year. For example, one must cut the 
part of the chamomile with special tools and try not to uproot the whole 
plant. The remaining plant will continue its reproductive circle to 
flourish next spring (Nature and Garden, 2020 ; SuperEverything, 2017 ). 
One participant notes: “it is part of our culture, older people knew by 
heart how long they had to wait and how to treat the chamomile for it to 
give back to them what it has to give” (Interview FWC, November 28, 
2019). The chamomile fields are openly accessible to anyone. They are 
governed by informal rules known to the commoning community, 
including the humans and the plant, about the temporalities and pro-
cesses of chamomile collection. 
Mining threatens the maintenance and flourishing of the chamomile 
commons. The chamomile depends on the underground waters of 
Kakavos mountain, and the ecologies provided by the forest which are 
both under threat by the mining expansion. The chamomile commons 
are spatial and temporal, underscoring how different agents depend on 
secure and healthy conditions that allow them to flourish in a particular 
space and in their unique time frames. Practices of caring with holds 
these socio-material relations together. The chamomile is treated by 
participants as having unique subjectivities, material needs, and tem-
poralities which are tended to by the commoning community. 
While the chamomile commons is located in Skouries, the benefits of 
the common extends beyond this physical boundary (Gibson-Graham 
et al., 2013 ). Chamomile and humans produce and transfer knowledge 
through their activities and biophysical processes by making medicinal 
chamomile that moves outside the local community to local markets. 
The chamomile is positioned as an ethically produced product that 
contributes maintains and contributes to the local economy and creates 
relations amongst those who are involved in commoning (Interview ML, 
May 19, 2019). The chamomile commons is a form of place-based 
contesation, that embodies respect for the socio-ecological rhythms of 
the plant involved in the process of growing and harvesting. 
Chamomile growth and collection require both intense productive 
periods as well as regenerative and restorative ones that are sensitive to 
the needs of more-than-humans. Through practices of caring with the 
chamomile, the human participants are encouraged to better understand

6the needs of the nonhumans and develop forms of empathy about and 
solidarity with the nonhuman world. They want to protect the commons 
as they are protecting themselves and their livelihoods, suggesting 
broader more-than-human subjectivities are being developed, as urged 
by Donna Haraway ’s (2015 , 2016) writing on the Anthropocene. The 
chamomile commons, and many others like it provides a local rationale 
for resisting the gold mine as people value the pre-existing socio -
ecological commons and more-than-human forms of caring with above 
the economic benefits that would lead to its erasure. Such diverse 
more-than-human commons inspire opposition within places threatened 
by Anthropocene change. The values cultivated in the chamomile 
commons suggest slowing down and becoming attuned to place-based 
processes and politics. This is far removed from the priorities of politi -
cal systems preoccupied with the rapid accumulation of economic 
growth. Similar values are expressed in the next commoning example, 
the women ’s collective. 
4.2.2. The women ’s collective 
In small villages of Greece, like the ones in Skouries, formal eco-
nomic activities are often dominated by men. However, the anti-mining 
struggle around Skouries gave birth to a women ’s collective in Ierissos village. A group of women, who previously were primarily involved in 
household caregiving, decided to create a small-scale collective to pro-
mote products from the local community to show the importance of 
sustaining local produce threatened by large-scale mining (Fig. 4). The 
initiative is constututed by temporary and permanent members involved 
in making sweet and salty pies with local products like strawberries, 
apples, and cheese, produced by local producers and farmers. The 
women ’s collective is governed by organic and informal processes 
(Rigkos-Zitthen, 2023 ) of decision-making between its permanent 
members while temporary members are also welcome to express their 
opinion in some decision-making processes, such as in the organisation 
of local social events. Through the years this commons developed a 
needs-based process of decision-making responding to initiatives and 
issues, with an emphasis on developing caring relationships to each 
other and the environment. The women ’s collective practiced caring with 
by preparing food for the anti-mining community, volunteering to 
organize anti-mining events, and participating in demonstrations. Such 
practices assisted in facilitating an understanding that the women 
involved could do something that would “satisfy our ambition to do 
what we knew to do, to cook, and to promote the products of our land 
which is now threatened due to large-scale mining ” (Focus Group 1,

Rigkos-Zitthen et al.

7March 13, 2019). 
Practices of caring with brought people from diverse backgrounds 
closer, challenged stereotypes, and forged new relations between people 
who, in some cases, originally did not like each other. For example, one 
of the participants explained: “I thought that X was an ignorant middle- 
class lady. I got to know her better through our collective activities. I 
appreciated her willpower to contribute to the common struggle against 
mining ” (Interview ML, May 19, 2019). Forming collective identities by 
challenging previous ones is a familiar phenomenon in commons 
struggles across the world (Felstead et al., 2019 ; Fotaki & Daskalaki, 
2020 ; Nightingale, 2019 ; Velicu & García-L ˘opez, 2018 ). As one of the 
participants of the collective pointed out: “we wanted to provide an 
alternative to the mining option. We wanted to show that many of our 
products will disappear if the large-scale mining operation starts ” 
(Interview ML, May 19, 2019). 
The economic productivity and well-being of the women ’s collective 
depended on different temporal cycles and human and nonhuman re-
lationships. For example, the fruit grown depends on different soil 
temperatures, which are shaped by seasonal rhythms that different fruits 
need to flourish at different times of the year (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 , 
2017 ). The harvest season for strawberries (spring-summer) differs from 
the season for harvesting apples (autumn-winter). Since the women ’s 
collective use local strawberries and apples to produce products like 
marmalade and strawberry and apple pies, their economic activity de-
pends on the seasons the fruit is available. Thus, there is a direct relation 
of dependency between the seasons, fruit, the women ’s collective pro-
duction, and the character and orientation of this commoning example, 
with actors negotiating how best to facilitate the survival of “earth 
others ” (Gibson & Dombroski, 2020 ). The maintenance of these 
small-scale commons depends on reproducing specific socio-material 
relations across space and time. 
Despite the struggle of the women ’s collective to “remain detached 
from external capital circuits ” (Interview ML, May 19, 2019), the 
maintenance of this commons requires capital. The women in the col-
lective orient their energies toward generating a surplus that can pro-
vide for the livelihoods of those involved akin to a community or social 
economy (Gibson-Graham et al., 2016 ). As such, the commons has 
become a community economy concerned with both wealth distribution 
and the sustenance of livelihoods (Gibson & Dombroski, 2020 ). The 
women running the collective invest time, effort, and capital to produce 
the food they sell. The commons needs to be financially sustainable and 
produce a surplus in order to sustain those who provide the labor. 
Consequently, with the growth of the collective ’s reputation, the bal-
ance between care and economic growth shifts through time. As one 
participant noticed: “we started the collective to prove that we do not 
have to depend on mining. Nowadays, our economic prosperity secures 
that we can continue proving that we are a prosperous alternative ” 
(Interview ML, May 19, 2019). As opposed to a private business, the 
collective does not seek to accumulate profit which is hierarchically 
distributed, but rather any surplus accumulated is reinvested into the 
collective as negotiated by the commons. 
There were tensions between the commoning participants which 
were resolved through participatory actions and the setting up of com-
mon goals. For example, the members of the Women ’s Collective have 
different opinions about the goals and scope of the collective yet over 
time they came up with a plan that sought to satisfy all members. The 
women ’s collective is an example of commoning as caring with, which 
reveals how small-scale local production can be attentive to the 
spatiotemporal differences and needs of those who comprise the com-
mons. This approach differs from dominant economic models that treat 
the environment and nonhumans as replaceable resources that should be 
transformed into economic value in the pursuit of growth. For many, it 
challenged the perception of the role of women in the local community 
and the village ’s economy (Fotaki & Daskalaki, 2020 ). Through the 
struggle against gold extraction, many women realized that they could 
apply the forms of knowledge and care they acquired as household caregivers (Papada, 2014 ). Not only did these women realize that they 
had great collective power and knowledge to apply in public, but they 
also managed to channel it into an organisation that gave them eco-
nomic power, new meanings, identities, and influence in their local 
community. 
The new relations that the women ’s collective created involved 
caring with one another and the local environment. This requires atten -
tiveness toward the spatiotemporal conditions that allow different local 
products to be produced. The women ’s collective demonstrates that 
economic growth and employment could be achieved in ways that 
spatially and temporarily sustain a long-term relationship with the 
socio-material conditions of their land. The vision of this commons is not 
limited to the mining projects ’ lifespan; instead, they depend on an 
intergenerational continuation of sustainable production. Such ap-
proaches, practices and values are also seen in the following example of 
the Ten-Day festival. 
4.2.3. The ten-day festival 
In 2009, people from Megali Panagia village formed an anti-mining 
group whose purpose was to discuss possible small-scale activities to 
oppose the establishment of mining activities in nearby Skouries Forest. 
By 2013 the group established an annual Ten-Day festival that included 
music, food, workshops, and activism to raise awareness about the 
destructive nature of the mine. As members from Megali Panagia stated: 
The festival ’s goal is to communicate the anti-mining community ’s 
demands, to connect and build solidarity networks with other col-
lective struggles across Greece and the world, and to bring people to 
experience and enjoy the importance of nature around Skouries. 
(Participant Observation 5, December 4, 2019) 
The festival aims to demonstrate how important the forest in Sko-
uries is for the local community and, through this intimate, joyful, and 
creative experience and social event, to draw support and attention from 
movements and social struggles outside the municipality (Fig. 5). Above 
all, the strategic purpose of this commons is to explore political alter-
natives based on grassroots networking. 
In this example, practices of caring with are expressed through the 
activities of those involved in organizing the festival. The polyarithmus 
commons is consisted of temporary and permanent group members who 
all together make decisions in a direct democratic fashion. Decisions are 
made by those who participate in the commons ’ meetings and the voted 
outcomes respected by members that are absent from meetings. The 
Ten-day festival formed through recognizing that they are interdepen -
dent upon the forest for their wellbeing. For example, people in Megali 
Panagia have argued, “without the forest, the clean air, and the water, 
we will lose the ability to live in our village ” (Participant Observation 3, 
May 17, 2019). Such insights were also expressed in the interviews, with 
one participant noting that

Rigkos-Zitthen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Political Geography 111 (2024) 103089
8for us [Megali Panagia’s anti-mining group], the forest is a vital part 
of our community. We get our salary from farming, beekeeping, and 
cattle breeding; all activities depend on the forest. Apart from that, it 
also protects us from floods and other physical disasters. It gives us – 
and protects – our life. (Participant Observation 3, May 17, 2019) 
The Skouries forest, where the mine is located, is a source of life, 
protection, and a space that allows diverse activities and relations to 
flourish, including the festival. Every year the group delegates volun -
teering responsibilities to various members of its committee. One 
participant explains how, 
one person is responsible for the music and technical equipment, the 
sound, the lights, and the placement of the speakers. This is a job 
performed alongside the bands who are invited to participate. 
Another person is responsible for finding the bands participating in 
the festival. Someone is responsible for the economics, while farmers 
from the area are invited to provide meat, potatoes, local delicacies, 
and drinks (Interview GD, November 7, 2019). 
Organizing the Ten-Day festival takes time. Since the festival takes 
place at the end of July and the beginning of August, the preparations 
must begin in March. One participant noted that “to deal with the 
different tasks, an enormous amount of labour is required, as well as 
dedication and personal sacrifices” (Interview ATH, June 1, 2019). 
Commoning as caring with is not only about the practical concerns of 
setting up the festival but also includes processes of exchanging ideas, 
and knowledge, building new relationships, and sharing experiences. 
The primary driver and common political aspiration that unites the 
members of the Ten-Day Festival is: “for local communities to be able to 
decide how to design the future [while] respecting the natural envi-
ronment” (Interview GD, November 27, 2019). The members of the Ten- 
Day festival communicate their aspirations and visions while expanding 
its scale of influence to a broad community of national and international 
movements and individuals. Through networks beyond the local scale, it 
seeks to find common ground between the anti-mining struggle in 
Skouries and other struggles across Greece and the world that experi -
ment with alternative locally-derived political visions. Such activities 
occur through roundtables and open discussions that include people 
from the village and outsiders who have been attracted to the event. 
Discussions focus on alternative ways of living and organizing that 
contest the logics of economic growth. The Tend Day Festival is a 
commons that projects the need for the local community to be engaged 
in alter and anti-capitalist politics and calls for local and national politics 
to include communities in decision-making processes to create sustain -
able and healthy socio-ecological systems (Rigkos-Zitthen, 2023). 
5.Practicing Caring with in the Anthropocene 
In this paper, we have gone a step beyond previous work on com-
mons and caring with (for example Parris & Williams, 2019), by posi-
tioning commoning and caring with as political responses to the 
destructive practices, politics and values driving Anthropocene change. 
Such work highlights the importance of building from already existing 
alternatives where values and practices have been developed at local 
scales to defend and restore socioecological landscapes. In this example 
commoning and caring with humans and nonhuman others is an ongoing 
practice that both pre-exists the mining development, in the case of the 
chamomile commons, and informs how resistance to the mine is 
expressed, in the case of the women’s collective and the Ten-Day 
Festival. Our case study suggests that many people are likely to be 
ontologically aligned to homines curans rather than homo-economicus 
when places they value are threatened (Tronto, 2017). We conclude 
with three key points derived from the case studies that can inform a 
politics for the Anthropocene. 
First, we see value in approaching the socioecological changes 
associated with the Anthropocene as the planetary accumulation of place-based decisions. While there have been discussions in the litera -
ture about planetary-scale governance and interventions in the form of 
geoengineering (Dryzek & Pickering, 2019), it is in particular places that 
the conditions of the Anthropocene are felt and reproduced. In the 
Skouries case, the conventional post-war development associated with 
the Great Acceleration, which prioritises economic growth over almost 
anything else, has provided the conditions for the gold mine proposal to 
go ahead. The mine is expected to generate income for local miners and 
national accounts struggling with debt, but will mostly benefit a foreign 
mining company and their shareholders. However, by focusing on 
affected communities in Skouries we have shown that efforts to create a 
single-use mining landscape (see Morton, 2018 on critiques of singular 
use) have experienced widespread resistance. The smoothening process 
is incomplete, experiencing ruptures and fractures as existing commons 
are threatened. These place-based politics of opposition and resistance 
to destructive developments occur across the world and suggest that 
values beyond economic growth are becoming more visible and artic-
ulated in the Anthropocene. People are taking action to influence and 
prevent decisions that contribute to planetary decline, inspired by 
different sets of values and practices that question the status quo. The 
political question that emerges is how to unite and build from 
place-based resistances to develop more effective opposition, or to 
paraphrase Massey (2005, p. 100): “how to follow the trails of other 
[‘Anthropocenes’], and encourage them … there is no reason why a local 
area’s most prominent international links should be uniquely through 
private capital.” 
This leads to our second point which is that the values and forms of 
resistance in Skouries provide alternatives to the dominant norms that 
have driven Anthropocene degradation. Rather than being a conflict 
over who gets to access the economic value of a resource, as many 
conflicts are interpreted today, what emerged here were conflicts based 
on different values systems as ways of being. The oppositional groups in 
Skouries valued commoning and practices of caring with. Through the 
three commoning examples presented in this article, we observed a 
plurality of practices that cultivated new forms of relations, un-
derstandings, and ethics amongst participants. The chamomile com-
mons is an example of how humans and nonhumans care with one 
another for long-term collective benefit. The women’s collective illus-
trates how new collective identities with seasonal rhythms and move -
ments can emerge through growing and working with local produce. 
The Ten-Day festival provides an example of the ways a local community 
cares with one another and the forest and builds networks to collectively 
learn about and experiment with other forms of commoning and resis-
tance. These forms of caring with are diverse, supportive and context- 
specific and suggest that hopeful responses to processes of planetary 
degradation are emerging from particular places. This is not to say that 
commoning provides the ‘answer’ to the Anthropocene but to say that 
local expressions of caring with can inform how politics is practiced, 
championing difference and diversity over homogeneity. Nor does it 
mean that all mining is necessarily fraught, it may well be possible to do 
forms of smaller scale mining in ways that are informed by principles of 
commoning and caring with that do not require the mass scale smooth -
ening and erasure of the locally valued commons. Indeed any broader 
scale transition towards renewable energy requires mining (Sonter et al., 
2020), however this should be pursued in ways work with rather than 
against local values and interests. As planetary systems degrade it is 
likely that community attachments to place and their ability for caring 
with will become more, rather than less, important, providing possibil -
ities for the articulation and development of alternative forms of poli-
tics, economics and values better suited for the new epoch. 
Our third concluding point concerns a politics of visibility. How can 
the benefits of commoning be amplified so as to contribute to new 
worlds in the Anthropocene? Following Gibson-Graham et al. (2016), 
this paper has contributed to the political task of making visible exam -
ples of commons operating against, within and beyond the logics of 
economic growth. Retelling such stories reveals that other ways of I. Rigkos-Zitthen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Political Geography 111 (2024) 103089
9living/doing/being and thinking are present in the everyday and that 
commons exist in our midst if we have the eyes to see them (Blomley, 
2008 ; Williams, 2016 , 2018 ). An apt response to the Anthropocene is to 
recognize and build from these diverse commoning practices and to 
ensure they are made visible and considerable as politics are reima -
gined. The Ten-Day Festival is trying to do just this, to build a coalition 
of actors who can communicate and explore practices of caring with 
through national and international movements. None of this is easy. The 
challenge of building connections and networks to maximize the impacts 
and profile of commoning activities whether through public, private or 
civil society organisations is substantial. A first step though is to artic-
ulate oppositional concepts, principles and ambitions and practice al-
ternatives, as is the case in Skouries, and seek political change through 
formal and informal structures (McGregor, 2004 ). The dilemma of how 
to include commoning in formal political projects in ways that amplify 
rather than degrade practices of caring with is an open question. 
Decision-makers at national and international scales do not have the 
same more-than-human connections and understandings of place, which 
enables them to use abstract economic arguments over more felt or 
caring ones. And yet the popularity, demands and actions of social 
movements across the planet, particularly in traditionally conservative 
areas through issues like fracking, suggests that principles of caring with 
may have broader political purchase. Rather than a ‘good ’ Anthro -
pocene, for it is not good, as planetary systems degrade and people 
mobilise to protect their homes and environments and recognize and 
identify more with others doing the same, perhaps a more caring 
Anthropocene, based on different sets of values will become possible. 
To conclude, the commoning examples discussed in this paper 
exemplify alternatives to economic growth at a local scale. However, 
their maintenance requires material resources and participant commit -
ment to sustain the commons that everyday responsibilities may not 
allow. Small and individual social experiments alone are clearly insuf-
ficient to respond to the planetary challenges of the Anthropocene, 
however, the cumulative and networked possibility of such experiments 
may hold some potential (Buck, 2015 ; Coles, 2016 ; Coles & Susen, 2018 , 
p. 240; Connolly, 2017 ). To facilitate such potential, we suggest two 
things. First, state institutions should engage with the alternative values 
being expressed and practiced by oppositional movements and assist 
activists and communities in strengthening and expanding practices of 
caring with through initiatives like commoning. While commoning 
practices often form in opposition to state practices, such as the Ten-Day 
Festival and the women ’s collective, they are mostly practiced out of 
view or in the shadows of state policy, as is the case for the chamomile 
commons. However, more effective and caring approaches to issues like 
public housing (Huron, 2018 ) and environmental protection (Gibson- -
Graham et al., 2016 ) have occurred when states have engaged with 
commoning. Bollier (2016) explored state-commoning relations and 
identified a range of modes through which better relations could 
develop, such as through legal protection of commons; regional meet-
ings to further understandings of local issues by state institutions and 
commoning communities; and advocacy for common assets and com-
moning by political parties. States can benefit from such arrangements 
by becoming more aware of and effective in addressing place-based 
concerns as a form of governance that builds political capital, while 
also becoming exposed to the expertise, values and practices of caring 
with, diversifying its capacity to respond to accelerating crises. As more 
places are threatened and more people mobilise against Anthropocene 
degradation, nurturing political spaces where existing alternatives can 
be expressed, expanded, and experimented with seems vital. The work 
of the community economies collective provides examples of how this 
can be done (e.g. Gibson-Graham et al., 2013 ; Healy, 2014 ). Second, 
research has a role in helping us better understand, engage with, and 
unravel the complexity of relations between economic growth and other 
values nurtured within commons. Such research can assist in learning 
how to be attentive to the unique socio-material relations between 
human and nonhuman agents evolving in the Anthropocene and how to practice caring with those actors. The logics and values produced by 
practices of caring with can help enrich political institutions and design 
responses that reflect plurality and diversity in logics and values that 
derive from place. Commoning as a practice of caring with provides 
promising ways of thinking through a politics for a more caring 
Anthropocene in a period of existential change.

science from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and a Ph.D. in Human Geography
