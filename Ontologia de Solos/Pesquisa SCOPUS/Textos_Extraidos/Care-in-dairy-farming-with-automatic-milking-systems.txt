Work environment ABSTRACT  
Context: In Sweden, 34% of herds in official statistics 2021 (77% of the cows) have an automatic milking system 
(AMS) and keep 19% of the dairy cows. 
Objective: This study should be considered in relation to the rapid increase of digitalisation in agriculture. It 
aimed at investigating Swedish farmers ’ experiences and reflections in dairy farming concerning AMS use from a 
care perspective, based on two research questions: 1) What kinds of success factors and management challenges 
do farmers experience with AMS usage? and 2) How do farmers view their work environment in this kind of 
system? 
Methods: A mixed method approach was performed, using method triangulation through a questionnaire, in-
terviews, and field visits. The Activity Theory (AT) was used as a theoretical lens to consider care practice in the 
dairy farming as a learning system. 
Results: AND CONCLUSIONS: Participating dairy farmers were found to be in a continuous learning process on 
different levels in their system, from detailed problems with an individual cow or the herd to the whole dairy 
system. Implementation of AMS required learning in order to manage, and thus care for, a system comprising of 
animals, technology, and humans, to increase business viability. In successful AMS use, willingness to learn, 
adapt to the local situation, and continually improve practice, or care as a patterning of activities, appeared to be 
the most important factors. With more people involved, differentiations were possible, which in turn accentuated 
the need for more trained staff who can perform more complicated tasks. The findings indicated high importance 
of experience and a ‘stockperson ’s eye’, in combination with tool-mediated seeing using data from the robot, in 
developing enhanced professional vision and good care. A good stockperson had broad competence combining a 
stockperson ’s eye with experience with robot data. One of the greatest challenges for dairy farms was finding a 
good stockperson as staff or advisor. Increased flexibility in work and better physical health were important 
driving forces for implementing AMS, while handling alarms was mentally stressful and gave different per-
spectives on AMS vulnerability. Overall, the analysis of the collected data showed that AMS had brought major, 
primarily positive, changes in daily work and increased work satisfaction for most farmers, with a clear majority 
of the respondents feeling good in their work situation and enjoying their work. 
Significance: Application of AT in studying AMS from a care perspective, represents a shift from traditional 
research that normally addresses technological inventions, to studying farmers ’ socio-technical system. The AT 
lens revealed the work practices in performing care, as a patterning of activities accomplished by a tinkering 
learning process, in the rich and messy matrix of humans, cows, and technology.   
1.Introduction 
The recent and rapid development of technology-oriented agricul -
tural trends, such as smart farming, digital agriculture and agriculture 4.0, reflects agricultural production within the dominant technocratic 
paradigm (e.g. Ayre et al., 2019 ; Clay et al., 2020 ; Finstad et al., 2021 ; 
Klerkx et al., 2019 ; Lioutas et al., 2019 ; Rijswijk et al., 2021 ). Milking 
robots or automated milking systems (AMS) fit this paradigm, since it

387has entailed new possibilities for data collection on the individual cows 
as well as the whole herd. The first commercial AMS was installed in the 
Netherlands in 1992 (de Koning, 2010 ), and since then adoption has 
increased steadily, especially in European countries (Salfer et al., 2017 ). 
In 2015, there were more than 25,000 dairy businesses with AMS 
worldwide (Barkema et al., 2015 ), and some estimates show that there 
were over 35,000 units on farms in 2017 (Salfer et al., 2017 ). The Nordic 
countries and the Netherlands have led in implementing AMS systems, 
with the highest percentage of AMS herds (Barkema et al., 2015 ). The 
first AMS in Sweden was installed in 1998 (Bergman and Rabinowicz, 
2013 ). By August 2020, Sweden had 3250 dairy businesses, with on 
average 94 cows each (https://www.lrf.se ). National statistics for 2021, 
covering 77% of Swedish cows, indicate that 35% of Swedish herds had 
AMS (735) (Vaxa, 2021 ). With the introduction of AMS, the whole 
practice of milking and related work practices or care has to be 
re-organised around the new robot device (Butler et al., 2012 ; Driessen 
and Heutinck, 2015 ). The AMS provides much data for each cow, sug-
gesting that the care perspective in AMS could be based on robot data, 
replacing the physical contact and visual inspection of each individual 
cow in conventional milking systems (CMS). However, some research 
indicates that care in AMS must be based on more than robot data to be 
successful (Lundstr om and Linblom, 2020 ; Stræte et al., 2017 ). It is 
therefore necessary to consider the interdependencies between humans 
and analogue and digital technologies, since technologies provide 
meaning only when embedded in social practice (Barrett and Rose, 
2020 ; Darnhofer, 2020 ; Finstad et al., 2021 ; Suchman, 2007 ). In a 
socio-technical perspective on dairy farming, the AMS is dependent on 
the farmer ’s work practice (Finstad et al., 2021 ; Rijswijk et al., 2021 ). 
Hence, it is not enough to study technology such as AMS in themselves, 
rather there is a recent quest to study how AMS are integrated into 
farmers ’ work practices from a systemic perspective, which includes 
people, technology, and cows. 
There are many approaches for evaluating work practices that 
include both people and technology. According to Krzywoszynska 
(2015) , among others, the care perspective is becoming central to the 
current reconceptualisations of agrarian space and practice in modern 
agriculture. Krzywoszynska (2015 , p. 1) paraphrases the classic defini -
tion of care by Tronto (1998) as “the totality of those activities which 
enable the maintenance, continuation, and repair of the farming 
‘world ’“. Today, it is acknowledged that good care is viewed as essential 
for any kind of good farming. The care perspective was applied in the 
present study, partly because of its criticisms of the technocratic and 
productivist paradigm in agriculture (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). 
Krzywoszynska ’s (2015 , p. 2) description of care goes as follows: “the 
totality of practices that make technology and knowledge work ”, which 
means that she considers care as a patterning of activities. As pointed out 
by Mol et al. (2010) , care is situated and place-based, as it involves 
developing local solutions to specific local problems. Moreover, care 
takes a relational approach that is built on mutual dependencies (Puig de 
la Bellacasa, 2017 ). The emerging understanding of care within farming 
is therefore considered as a non-normative proposition and an amalgam 
of vital affective states, ethical obligations, and ongoing tinkering 
practices that have their roots in early feminist social science and po-
litical theory (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2012 ). In this present paper, we 
investigate and analyse care as a patterning of activities in dairy farming 
with AMS. 
Implementation of AMS on-farm requires learning in order to 
manage, and thus care for, an entire socio-technical system comprising 
animals, technology and humans, in order to create a viable dairy 
business. Learning is required by the farmer to properly manage an 
automated system, based on robots milking the cows, and by the cows to 
fit into the particular system. It is a learning process for all to manage the 
system and provide good care. Thus, care is both considered as a process 
as well as the outcome of this process in the present paper. 
The study of care does not have any accompanying methodological 
approach other than naturalistic inquiry in general for doing the analysis. We therefore suggest that a viable approach to investigate and 
analyse care on the dairy farm as a patterning of activities that includes a 
learning perspective is to use Activity Theory (AT) as a theoretical lens 
(Kaptelinin et al., 1999 ; Kaptelinin, 2013 ). Application of AT in studying 
a socio-technical system such as AMS represents a shift in the research 
focus from addressing the technological inventions to considering the 
ways in which farmers as human actors interact with the technology, the 
animals, other humans and with each other within a conceptual 
framework that is regulated by specific requirements and constraints (cf. 
Bannon, 1995 ). Therefore, the AT lens can reveal the work practices of 
performing care as a patterning of activities in the rich and messy matrix 
of humans, cows, and technology, which can shed some light on the 
ways in which AMS influence care as well as result in care (Lioutas et al., 
2019 ). A major strength with AT is its focus on learning within the 
socio-technical system from a systemic perspective. Activity Theory has 
been widely and successfully applied in research on human-technology 
interactions in various domains since the mid-1990s (Rogers, 2012 ), and 
has recently been suggested for use in studies on automated intelligent 
systems like robots (Lindblom and Alenljung, 2020 ), agriculture (Liou-
tas et al., 2019 ) and dairy production using AMS (Lundstr om and Lin-
blom, 2020 ). We therefore consider that AT fits as hand in glove for a 
systemic way of studying care in dairy farming with AMS. 
This study aimed at investigating Swedish farmers ’ experiences and 
reflections from the perspective of care in dairy farming using AMS. The 
work was based on the following research questions: 1) What kinds of 
success factors and management challenges do farmers experience with 
AMS usage? and 2) How do farmers view their work environment in this 
kind of system? 
In Section 2, we first summarise previous work on the reasons for and 
against investment in AMS and outcomes of the transition from CMS to 
AMS. Next, we introduce the care perspective and its application in AMS 
studies and then elaborate on the tenets of AT. In particular, we assess 
the suitability of AT for studying human-technology interaction in 
general and use of AMS as an advanced socio-technical farm system in 
particular. In Section 3, we describe the overall study design, while the 
empirical results obtained are presented in Section 4. The implications 
of the results are discussed and some areas for future work are indicated 
in Section 5, while overall conclusions are presented in Section 6. 
2.Background and related work 
2.1. Development and impact of AMS on humans and cows on the dairy 
farm 
The digital transformation of AMS introduction meant replacement 
of CMS with milking robots based on digital technology and automation 
to handle the daily milking of dairy cows (Douphrate et al., 2013 ; 
Holloway et al., 2014b ; Karttunen et al., 2016 ; Lunner Kolstrup and 
Horndahl, 2013 ; Lunner Kolstrup et al., 2018 ; Rijswijk et al., 2021 ; 
Salfer et al., 2017 ). Multiple reasons for farmers investing in AMS have 
been identified, including economic reasons (Vik et al., 2019 ). Other 
common reasons are to increase flexibility, efficiency and animal wel-
fare aspects, decrease heavy physical workload, improve farming life-
style and wellbeing, reduce the amount of hired labour (Eastwood and 
Renwick, 2020 ; Hansen et al., 2019 ; Stræte et al., 2017 ), reduce physical 
risks, and increase the possibility for succession or to grow without 
additional labour (Stræte et al., 2017 ). In the Swedish context, improved 
physical work environment has been identified as the most important 
reason for investing in AMS, while high capital investment cost is the 
main reason for not investing (Bergman and Rabinowicz, 2013 ). 
Implementation of AMS is complex, due to the interactions between the 
social, the cyber, and the physical (Rijswijk et al., 2021 ), where much 
can go wrong in daily operations (Gustafsson, 2009 ). 
Data on Swedish and UK farms show that AMS does not decrease 
working hours by as much as expected, but gives farmers greater flexi-
bility and allows them to milk more cows with fewer staff (Gustafsson, C. Lundstr om and J. Lindblom                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Journal of Rural Studies 87 (2021) 386–403
3882009 ; Butler et al., 2012 ; Stræte et al., 2017 ). According to a Norwegian 
study, AMS farmers are more revenue-efficient than CMS farmers are, 
after a transition period of approximately four years (Hansen et al., 
2019 ). Milk production per cow, labour costs and milk production per 
robot are the main factors affecting profitability (Salfer et al., 2017 ). An 
AMS can result in labour savings, as some work tasks are reduced or 
eliminated, but new tasks are added (Bergman and Rabinowicz, 2013 ; 
Eastwood and Renwick, 2020 ; Hansen, 2015 ). Mental stress caused by 
the monotonous, repetitive, fast-paced and urgent milking work in CMS 
decreases after switching to AMS (Karttunen et al., 2016 ; Lunner 
Kolstrup and Horndahl, 2013 ). Mental stress can still arise with AMS, 
due to night alarms, lack of sufficiently skilled labour/staff and 24/7 
readiness of the milking robot (Butler et al., 2012 ). However, farmers 
can adapt the AMS to their own needs and thus reduce the number of 
alarms (Hansen, 2015 ). 
The transition from CMS to AMS also alters the role of the stock 
person (Ouweltjes and de Koning, 2004 ; Butler et al., 2012 ; Holloway 
et al., 2014b ; Stræte et al., 2017 ). With AMS, a wider range of data are 
collected on the cow herd, the individual cow and milk quality, which 
together can improve milk production (Bugge and Skibrek, 2019 ; Butler 
et al., 2012 ). Less time is spent on milking, but more time is needed for 
analysis and evaluation of AMS data and observation of cowherd be-
haviours (Stræte et al., 2017 ). Some even suggest that a change from 
CMS to AMS changes the meaning of ‘stockmanship ’, from referring to a 
person with knowledge and skills based on close contact with animals to 
a computer-based worker with increased distance to the animals, using 
the robot and computer as intermediaries (Stræte et al., 2017 ). Holloway 
et al. (2014b) refer to cows ‘hiding ’ in technology. Another reason for a 
change in stockmanship is that AMS often means more cows in the herd 
and increased efficiency in the dairy industry, leading to shorter cow life 
and thus more limited possibilities for relationships to develop (Burton 
et al., 2012) . 
The introduction of AMS requires learning on how to handle a highly 
automated system based on robots that milk the cows, instead of people 
doing it (Hansen et al., 2019 ; Tse et al., 2017 ). There are challenges in 
integrating conventional work practices with multiple technical and 
digital systems in a dairy farming context (Eastwood et al., 2012 ; Lunner 
Kolstrup et al., 2018 ). Farmers ’ engagement with AMS data varies 
widely (Holloway et al., 2014b ; Stræte et al., 2017 ). Some use data 
intensively and others are either unaware of the kind of data available or 
unable/unwilling to use these data. Increased use of technical and dig-
ital systems could result in significant changes in the relationship be-
tween humans and animals, giving rise to various socio-ethical 
dilemmas (Stræte et al., 2017 ). On the one hand, farmers with AMS are 
expected to care for their cows using AMS data. On the other hand cows 
are expected to look after themselves and behave according to the de-
mands set by the AMS or, if not, they must be persuaded, enticed or 
forced (Holloway et al., 2014a ). 
Regardless of their reasons for changing milking system, farmers 
must be motivated to learn and develop relevant skills to use AMS in the 
local situation on their dairy farm (Stræte et al., 2017 ). This means there 
are learning costs connected with the transition from one milking system 
to another (Hansen et al., 2019 ). Thus, AMS farmers/companies need to 
have a genuine interest in both cows and technology (Bergman and 
Rabinowicz, 2013 ). 
To summarise, from a socio-technical system perspective shifting 
from CMS to AMS does not simply involve introduction of a new kind of 
technology, but also requires an entirely new management system with 
altered milking and working practices both humans and cows. The focus 
on work practices is a well-established research field within socio- 
technical systems in general, but has not been applied to AMS in 
particular. Inclusion of new technology in an existing socio-technical 
system is a more complex issue than technology acceptance, because it 
requires integration into existing complex work practices that some -
times are implicit (Lindblom et al., 2017 ; Lundstr om and Lindblom, 
2018 ). A promising approach to gain a systemic view on the practice of including technology, humans and work is to apply the care perspective 
as a patterning of activities. 
2.2. Care as a practice 
The care perspective has been used in relation to farming (Mol et al., 
2010 ), wine production (Krzywoszynska, 2015 ), permaculture (Puig de 
la Bellacasa, 2017 ) and agricultural soils (Krzywoszynska, 2019 , 2020 ; 
Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 , 2017 ) and concerns humans as well as 
non-humans and natural settings (Krzywoszynska, 2019 ; Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2017 ). Using care as a perspective is a way to highlight the 
value of experiential and situated knowledge, an ethos built on atten -
tiveness, responsibility, and interdependent relations in a practice. Care 
is not considered an obligation, a principle, a role or an emotion, but the 
result of all practices that make technology and knowledge work in 
complex domains (Krzywoszynska, 2015 ). Care, from our point of view 
could be considered a process of development and learning as well as the 
resulting outcome, in practice. Accordingly, the care perspective is 
useable to describe what Finstad et al. (2021) call a relational learning 
process in adoption, integration, and use of AMS as well as a way to 
conceptualise farming as a relational process, which according to 
Darnhofer (2020) is dynamic, changing, emerging, and difficult to pre-
dict. Hence, we consider that the care perspective encompasses this shift 
from focusing solely on technology or an engineering mindset (Jacob, 
1977 ), and instead focuses on the patterning of activities as a relational 
process as well as the resulting outcome of these activities. This means 
that care is both the means and the end. 
Farmers ’ daily work practices are complex, as they require knowl -
edge and consideration of a wide range of biological, technological, 
practical, political, legal, economic, ethical and social factors and cir-
cumstances (e.g. Lindblom et al., 2013 ; Nitsch, 1994 ). The farmer needs 
to manage a wide range of competences, including: 1) knowledge about 
the subject (dairy etc.), 2) skills in formal planning (economic records 
etc.), 3) practical skills, and 4) knowledge of the institutional environ -
ment (legislation, market conditions etc.) (Nitsch, 2009 ). However, “The 
crucial element is the ability to apply them in the coordination of the com-
plexities of farming on a specific farm ” (Nitsch, 1994 , p. 32). This kind of 
knowledge practice and skills, expressed as care in this paper, is per-
sonal. The increase in technology aspects of farming entails an increased 
risk of concealing or blurring reciprocal relationships and dependencies, 
which the care perspective may be able to clarify. Nothing impedes any 
kind of technology in care according to Mol et al. (2010 , p. 15): “Tech-
nologies, what is more, do not work or fail in and of themselves. Rather, they 
depend on care work. On people willing to adapt their tools to a specific 
situation while adapting the situation to the tools, on and on, endlessly 
tinkering ”. This makes the care perspective a suitable perspective for 
studying learning processes in complex agricultural systems. 
At first glance, dairy farming involves individually rather easy in-
terventions, such as feeding cows, cleaning floors, milking, etc. On 
closer inspection, however, dairy farming is complex and demands tacit 
knowledge and highly complicated skills in simultaneously handling 
animals, technology and more. The overall management of the dairy 
system is a question of routines, technology, knowledge, experience, 
planning and a stockperson ’s eye, to perform good care in dairy pro-
duction. With adoption of AMS, farmers ’ physical distance to the ani-
mals increases and care changes (Bergman and Rabinowicz, 2013 ; 
Driessen and Heutinck, 2015 ; Stræte et al., 2017 ). Adoption of new 
technology can limit, change, improve and even jeopardise the in-
dividual ’s possibility to develop good and broad relations to 
non-humans within the farming context. The crucial factor is the need 
for tinkering within existing strategies and use of attentiveness and 
experiential knowledge to deliver as good care as possible in continually 
evolving situations. 
When a dairy farm changes from CMS to AMS, this brings major 
changes in how care is expressed and manifested in the daily work 
(Bergman and Rabinowicz, 2013 ; Driessen and Heutinck, 2015 ; Stræte C. Lundstr om and J. Lindblom                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Journal of Rural Studies 87 (2021) 386–403
389et al., 2017 ). In AMS, the lives of the cows are less controlled, especially 
with free cow traffic. Holloway et al. (2014b) claim there is also a 
change in the meaning of good stockmanship on changing from CMS to 
AMS. In CMS, good stockmanship is based on knowledge and skills 
developed from long-term first-hand contact with the cows and acquired 
experience of e.g. milking. In AMS, good stockmanship is mostly based 
on computer usage, data interpretation and responding to suggested 
computer-based interventions, with increased distance between the 
stockperson and the animal(s) (Holloway et al., 2014b ). ‘Knowing ’ or 
‘seeing ’ through a technical device, instead of in reality, means tool--
mediated seeing (Goodwin and Goodwin, 1996 ). In CMS, experiential 
knowledge of milking and handling cows results in a professional vision 
(Goodwin, 1994 ), but in AMS farmers must develop enhanced profes -
sional vision (Lundstr om and Lindblom, 2018 ), in order to use technology 
to ‘see’ the cows and thus use AMS effectively. Consequently, AMS re-
structures the relationships between humans and animals (Holloway 
et al., 2014b ). Farmers receive more data on each cow, and can get to 
‘know ’ each cow better via the digital management system of the AMS, 
while cows have more freedom to decide concerning milking, resting, 
and feeding. 
The transformation from CMS to AMS means a lateral shift in re-
sponsibility from the farmer to the individual cow (Driessen and Heu-
tinck, 2015 ; Holloway et al., 2014b ). In AMS, cows are expected to make 
the correct choices and can be “variously persuaded, motivated, forced or 
‘tricked ’ into doing so through, for example, installing devices which enforce 
particular patterns of movement, or by direct human interventions such as 
‘fetching ’ or culling reluctant cows ” (Holloway et al., 2014a . p. 139). Thus, 
the cows need to learn to ‘take care of themselves ’ within the AMS, but 
care is also distributed in the sense that the cows are simultaneously 
worked on/taken care of by the farmer (Driessen and Heutinck, 2015 ). 
“The freedom for both cows and humans promoted by the manufacturers as a 
benefit of robotic milking becomes a responsibility to take care/be taken care 
of and to foster productive life” (Holloway et al., 2014a , p. 140). The 
farmer must provide good prerequisites for the dairy system, but the 
individual cow must in turn adapt to the particular system. 
Although the care perspective is very promising and accurate in 
describing the means and ends of care in work practices at the inter-
section of technology, humans, and cows on dairy farms that use AMS, 
there is currently no explicit way or methodology suggested for inves -
tigating and analysing the care perspective in a systemic way. Most care 
studies are conducted using various naturalistic study approaches (Mol 
et al., 2010 ; Krzywoszynska, 2015 ). As argued in the Introduction, Ac-
tivity Theory (AT) could enable a more structured approach to study the 
wider socio-technical system of AMS in dairy farms, as it has a broader 
unit of analysis, focusing on the mediating role of technology use while 
situating the users at the centre of the social and material context. The 
focus in AT on studying so-called contradictions during technology 
mediation also provides insights for learning and development, which 
are aspects well aligned with the care perspective. 
2.3. The conceptual framework of Activity Theory (AT) 
Activity Theory, sometimes called Cultural-Historical Activity The-
ory (CHAT), provides a comprehensive conceptual framework that can 
be used for grasping and portraying the structure and development of 
human activity situated in its technical and social context (Kaptelinin 
et al., 1999 ; Kaptelinin, 2013 ). Activity Theory emerged in the 
1920s –1930s and has since undergone three generations of research 
(Engestr om, 2001 ). It provides a broad and complex framework for 
describing and evaluating the structure, development, and context of 
human activity, considering individuals, artefacts and other humans and 
subjects, as well as their interrelations (Duignan et al., 2006 ; Kaptelinin 
et al., 1999 ). According to AT, the only way to understand the human 
mind is in the context of human interaction with the world, and this 
interaction, i.e., activity, is socially and culturally constructed (Kapte -
linin, 2013 ). Since its inception, the underlying principles of AT make up an 
intertwined system forming a whole that represents several aspects of 
human activity. This creates a need to apply these principles from a 
systemic perspective, because of their interrelatedness, which unfolds 
over time. One way to do so is to use the extended AT framework called 
Activity System model (Engestr om, 2001 , 2015 ) (Fig. 1). The Activity 
System model is a way to visualise the different interactions between 
various elements when performing an activity and its outcome from a 
systemic perspective. 
In the Activity System model, the interactions between subject (user, 
which in this context is the farmer), object (cows on the dairy farm), 
main mediating artefact (the milking robot and supporting instruments 
and digital tools) and community (society, advisors etc) are mediated by 
specific mediational means. These are: mediating artefact and tools/ 
instruments for the subject-object interaction, rules (e.g., norms, work 
practice, and legislation) for the subject-community interaction, and 
division of labour for the community-object interaction (Engestr om, 
2001 , 2015 ; Kaptelinin, 2013 ). The Activity System model also includes 
the outcome of the activity system as a whole, namely the trans -
formation of the object generated by the activity in question into a 
suggested outcome. This visualisation approach highlights the contin -
uous process of transformation and development over time (Fig. 1). It 
should be pointed out that Engestr om (2001 , 2015) applies a systemic 
approach to theorise humans ’ intentional activities, without considering 
humans as passive factors lacking any internal properties or motives. 
This way of thinking highlights the continuous process of transformation 
and development over a time horizon of learning. 
A critical step when analysing an activity system is looking for so- 
called contradictions within the system, i.e., any misfit within an 
element in the system, between elements in the system, or between the 
current activity system and other activity systems (Engestr om, 2001 , 
2015 ). The use of the contradiction term within AT should not be mixed 
up with common usage of the term. In AT, contradictions are manifested 
as challenges, problems, interruptions, workarounds, or breakdowns 
that need to be handled or coped with. In AT, these contradictions are 
usually regarded as sources of development, because human activities 
are often a work in progress to handle the current contradiction(s) 
(Engestr om, 2001 , 2015 ; Kaptelinin, 2013 ; Lindblom and Alenljung, 
2020 ). These contradictions do not always address themselves explicitly, 
but rather are manifested implicitly via small changes in the subject ’s 
mundane work actions (Engestr om, 2000 ). 
According to Engestr om (2015) , when an activity system is under 
transformation, the actors within the system must develop new forms of 
activities that are not yet present in the system, often by contradictions, 
and therefore new activities are learned as they are created. Engestr om 
(2015) describes the learning process as developmental cycles, in which 
contradictions are the driving force, as expansive cycles. Therefore, it is 
of major importance to study contradictions from several perspectives, 
shifting focus from the actions and operations of the individual to 
zooming out to the broader activity context and then zooming in again 
(Lindblom and Alenljung, 2020 ). 
An activity can be understood as a purposeful, transformative and 
developing interaction between actors (subjects) and the world (ob-
jects). In the present paper, care is considered both as the activity as such 
and as the intended outcome of the activity system in dairy farming with 
AMS. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the activity concept that 
is fundamental in AT, the five central principles that AT is built upon are 
briefly presented below: hierarchical structure of activity, object- 
orientedness, tool mediation, internalisation-externalisation, and 
development. These principles are aligned with the view of care as the 
patterning of activities. 
The hierarchical structure of activity, i.e., the care perspective in 
dairy farming with AMS, organises an activity into three levels, activity, 
action and operation, which are related to motive, goal and condition 
(Kaptelinin, 1996 , 2013 ; Rogers, 2012 ). The top level is the activity it-
self, carried out to fulfil a motive, i.e., providing good care in dairy C. Lundstr om and J. Lindblom

390farming. The middle level, action, is described as conscious processes 
subordinated to the activity. Actions correspond to what must be done 
such as feeding, cleaning stables, washing AMS items, and milking cows 
and are directed at specific goals, which may be decomposed into 
sub-goals, sub-sub-goals etc., which means that multiple actions and 
operations may be nested to fulfil the activity. Thus, each action of 
milking cows is decomposed into hierarchical levels. In the bottom level, 
the operations function as lower-level units of actions (Kaptelinin, 1996 ; 
Rogers, 2012 ). As such, operations do not have their own goals, but are 
rather a result of prior actions that have been transformed into auto-
mated operations (Kaptelinin, 2013 ). Hence, viewing human activity as 
a three-layer system offers the possibility for combined analysis of 
motivational, goal-directed and operational aspects of human activity of 
care in the socio-cultural and material world, by interrelating the issues 
of “why ”, “what ” and “how ” within a coherent framework (Kaptelinin, 
1996 , 2013 ; Lindblom and Alenljung, 2020 ; Rogers, 2012 ). 
The principle of object-orientedness states that all human activities are 
directed towards different objects (e.g. cows on the dairy farm) and 
these objects motivate and direct activities. Activities such as providing 
care when running a dairy farm are coordinated around objects, so 
analysis of objects is necessary for understanding human activities, both 
at the individual and collective levels. In other words, object- 
orientedness refers to the current context and setting of usage, where 
the human (subject) interacts ‘indirectly ’ with the context (objects, the 
cows on the farm) through various mediating tools/artefacts (Kapteli -
nin, 1996 , 2013 ; Lindblom and Alenljung, 2020 ). In this paper, the most 
prominent mediating artefact is the AMS. 
The principle of tool mediation is at the core of Russian cultural- 
historical psychology (Vygotsky, 1978 ; Lindblom and Ziemke, 2003 ). 
The tool concept is broadly applied, and embraces material, physical 
tools (e.g., computer screens, milking robot) and psychological tools (e. 
g. charts, tables, and figures from the AMS software), shaping the ways 
users interact with the world. Placing tool mediation in the broader 
social context means that mediation enables various forms of acting in 
and interacting on the world (Kaptelinin, 2013 ). The object of activity is 
the actual setting and meaningful context in which the milking robot is 
used, i.e., the cows on the dairy farm. 
The principle of internalisation-externalisation stresses that human 
activity has a double nature, because every activity has both an external 
and internal side. Hence, the internalisation-externalisation principle is 
characterised by the ongoing shifting back and forth between what 
happens internally “in the head ”, i.e., what the farmers think and reflect 
upon and what happens practically and externally “in the open ” in 
human activity, i.e., how the farmers acquired practical knowledge and skills are manifested in their actions and operations of milking and 
conducting care in dairy farming with AMS. The internal and external 
sides of activity are gradually becoming more intertwined in human 
work practices and daily life from a developmental perspective man-
ifested in the shift from CMS to AMS (Kaptelinin et al., 1999 ; Kaptelinin, 
2013 ; Kaptelinin and Nardi, 2018 ). The socio-cultural dimension of tool 
mediation which is evident in the fact that mediation enables various 
developed forms of acting in the world. (Engestr om, 2015 ). However, use 
of tools not only transforms the objects themselves, but is a mutual 
‘two-way process ’, where tools reflect previous experiences of using the 
tool and how to design the tool, i.e., tools embody a set of social prac-
tices and their current design reveals a history of particular usage, such 
as current AMS compared to CMS. 
As pointed out by Halverson (2002) , the Activity System model has 
been widely used to analyse various work settings, particularly when 
there are problems with current or newly implemented technology, 
where the model enables investigators to identify both micro- and 
macro-level issues. A suggested approach to frame Activity System 
model analysis is the eight-step model developed by Mwanza and 
Engestr om (2005) , which offers a structured way to describe the activity 
and sub-activity triangles in the model. The challenges arising on 
changing from CMS to AMS can thus be considered a shift between two 
activity systems of milking that raises contradictions, which are 
managed through learning by developmental cycles from an established 
care to another new form of care. 
3.Method and research design 
The present study used a mixed methods research design (Creswell 
and Clark, 2017 ; Patton, 2002 ). Mixed methods is a research design 
approach where researchers collect and analyse both quantitative and 
qualitative data within the same study. The growth of mixed methods 
research design has increased as a way to study increasing complexity on 
the object of study within the social sciences community. Applying 
mixed methods design allows researchers to explore diverse perspectives 
and uncover relationships that exist in multifaceted research challenge. 
As pointed out by Creswell and Clark (2017) , numerous classifications of 
mixed methods designs are found to exist in the literature, and we have 
chosen to use triangulation design. Triangulation design is the most 
common and well-known approach to mixing methods and the main 
purpose of this design is to collect different but complementary data on 
the same topic to gain a deeper understanding of the particular research 
questions and the study ’s aim. We apply an inductive drive which means 
that the study design is qualitatively driven with the purpose to expand

391qualitative results with quantitative data (Schoonenboom and Johnson, 
2017 ). 
Data triangulation (Patton, 2002 ) was performed using different data 
collection techniques (questionnaire, interviews, and field visits). Tak-
ing on a sequential design (Schoonenboom and Johnson, 2017 ), data 
collection started with interviews, in order to gain an initial under -
standing of farmers ’ experiences and perceived pros and cons with AMS. 
Nine farmers (eight with AMS and one who had invested in AMS, but 
then changed back to CMS), four advisors and two AMS representatives 
were interviewed (Table 1). The farmers interviewed had 2-8 robots, in 
use for 2–11 years. The number of cows on the farms varied from 120 to 
425, and the sample included farms with both free and guided cow 
traffic. The farmers were purposely sampled, in order to get as much 
information as possible (Patton, 2002 ). The interviews were 
semi-structured, lasted 1–2 hours and were conducted in real life (all 
farmers and the company representatives), by telephone (two advisors) 
or by Skype (two advisors). All interviews were audio-recorded except 
for the telephone interviews, where notes were taken. The questions 
concerned experiences of AMS in relation to work environment, pro-
duction, advisory services, and technology use. The companies inter-
viewed were DeLaval, Lely, Vaxa Sverige, and a sole proprietorship. The 
sole proprietor was suggested by one farmer, who contacted the first 
author due to the project. 
A questionnaire was developed based on initial analysis of the 
interview responses, which means that the questionnaire design was 
dependent on the initial analysis of the collected data from the interviews 
(Schoonenboom and Johnson, 2017 ). The final questionnaire comprised 
29 questions, some with sub-questions, structured into seven topics: 1) 
background, 2) milk production, 3) experiences of AMS, 4) experienced 
mental stress, 5) advisory aspects, 6) future possibilities and challenges, 
and 7) the work situation. The questionnaire included questions with 
Likert scales ranging from false to true, multiple-choice questions and 
five open questions, thus mainly subjective results based on farmers ’ 
opinions. In Sweden, no complete official statistics exist that collect 
information about what kind of milking system a particular farm uses. 
The Swedish cattle statistics 2021 from the company Vaxa Sverige 
comprise 77% of the Swedish cows and 35% of the herds (735 herds) 
had AMS (Vaxa, 2021 ). Therefore, we asked the leading AMS com-
panies, DeLaval and Lely to spread the link to the questionnaire, through 
their newsletters. In addition, the same invitation was sent through a 
Facebook group for Swedish AMS farmers that comprises of more than 
3000 members. Swedish farmers are well educated and we assumed that 
this approach could reach many AMS farms in Sweden. 
Completed questionnaires were submitted via a link, and therefore 
anonymous. Accordingly, it was impossible to calculate the response 
rate. In total, 293 responses to the questionnaire were submitted. Since this study examined the whole milking system on dairy farms, only 
answers from those who defined themselves as owners are presented in 
the results section (207 owners). With dropouts due to few questions 
answered, the results presented represent answers from 188 re-
spondents. When a question concerned a comparison between CMS and 
AMS, only answers from owners with experiences of both systems were 
included. No statistics were performed on the questionnaire data given 
the inductive drive in the mixed methods design approach. It should be 
pointed out that we did not aim for generalisability with the question -
naire, but to add additional and complementary quantitative data to the 
qualitative data. 
Field visits were conducted on three dairy farms in order to gain a 
deeper understanding of how AMS work and are used in work practice. 
The farms were located in western Sweden in the former county of 
Skaraborg and Jonkoping, which are two of the regions with the highest 
densities of dairy cows in Sweden (Svensson et al., 2018 ). The farms 
represented: i) a large family farm with a very technology-interested 
female farmer who had relatively short experience of dairy farming 
but sometimes tests new technology for DeLaval (Farm 2); ii) a family 
farm with one female farmer who had medium interest in technology 
and long experience of dairy farming (Farm 8), and iii) a farm with one 
male farmer with long experience of dairy production (both CMS and 
AMS) and an interest in new technology (Farm 9). See Table 1 for data 
on all three farms. Each field visit took 1–2 h. The first and second field 
visits were performed by the first author in conjunction with interviews 
with the farmers. No systematic observations were conducted on the 
farms. During the farm visits, interviews were held in farm offices, 
where the computerised AMS software was demonstrated, and in cow-
sheds where the AMS were installed. Visits were conducted together 
with the farmer or an employee, in order to observe and gain a deeper 
understanding of the whole activity system. The third field visit (Farm 9) 
was conducted as a follow-up by both authors during analysis of the 
collected data. In addition, field notes, photographs, and 
video-recordings were made during the visits to the cowsheds. 
The collected data were analysed as follows: The transcripts from the 
interviews and the field notes were read through a couple of times and 
analysed thematically, using the focal points of AT (Mwanza and 
Engestr om, 2005 ). An AT lens was then applied to analyse care (Mol 
et al., 2010 ; Krzywoszynska, 2015 ; Tronto, 1998 ). The questionnaire 
responses were analysed in Excel, and included in the above thematic 
content analysis, especially the responses of the open ended questions. 
The unstructured observations from the field visits were used to com-
plement the other sources of data. It should be emphasised that although 
the data collection was done sequentially the overall analysis was done 
through several analytic points of integration were quantitative and 
qualitative components were brought together (Schoonenboom and 
Johnson, 2017 ), with the support of the focal points of AT. As pointed 
out by Creswell and Clark (2017) , a primary way to connect qualitative 
and quantitative data is to use a theoretical framework to bind together 
the data sets. Qualitative data was used to illustrate quantitative results 
as well as qualitative data was used to describe the underlying process for 
the obtained quantitative results (Schoonenboom and Johnson, 2017 ). 
4.Results 
In this section, we apply the eight-step model of focal points devel -
oped by Mwanza and Engestr om (2005) (subsection 4.1) and present 
more detailed findings on the focal points related to success factors and 
challenges in using AMS. We then zoom out and consider the activity of 
learning and using AMS on dairy farms from a care perspective (sub-
section 4.2). 
4.1. Application of the activity system on dairy farms using AMS 
To support the analysis of AMS from an AT lens, we used the eight- 
step model of focal points as depicted in Table 2. The first step refers to Table 1

392describe the activity under investigation. The second step refers to 
asking the “why ” motive behind the activity. The third step refers to 
identify the actors/subjects who perform the activity in the first step. 
The fourth step refers to identifying the main mediating artefact and the 
tools that mediate this activity. The fifth step clarifies the rules that 
constrain and regulate the activity. The sixth step tries to grasp and 
describe how labour is divided and distributed among the actors/sub -
jects who participate within the activity system. The seventh step refers 
to explaining the community of actors involved in the activity. 
Applying the activity system on a dairy farm made continually 
ongoing work, including collaboration and other influencing factors on 
the farm, more visible, highlighting the activity within the whole sys-
tem. The activity, in this paper was managing a dairy farm using AMS 
from the perspective of care. Good care for the dairy farm business was 
regarded as the outcome of the activity system, where good care meant a 
learning process aiming to create a viable (defined by the farmer or the 
farmer leadership) dairy business, which in turn motivated (the objec-
tive) the farmer. The subject of the system was the individual farmer (or 
the farm business leadership), who interacted with several tools, of 
which the milking robot was the main mediating digital artefact , together 
with additional tools and instruments, and psychological tools such as a 
stockperson ’s eye, to manage dairy production. The main object in the 
activity system was the cow herd consisting of individual cows. Many 
implicit and explicit rules, norms, and procedures are relevant in the case 
at hand, e.g., safety and animal welfare legislation and other work- 
related rules, routines, norms, and practices that regulate the use of 
AMS on the dairy farm and cow care. The division of labour in the case 
referred to the distribution of responsibility of the work in relation to milk production between the farmer or farm leadership, the farmer ’s 
family members, and potential stockpersons and/or employees at the 
dairy farm. The community considered in this study was limited, but 
advisors, bankers, friends, colleagues, veterinarians, salesmen etc. could 
be a part of the community in this kind of activity system (Table 2). 
One of the research questions posed in this study was “What kinds of 
success factors and management challenges do farmers experience with 
AMS usage? ” The outcomes identified were mapped out onto the focal 
points of the underlying activity system. Below we present more detailed 
findings for each focal point, starting with the farmer ’s objective and 
general reflections on AMS usage. One central issue addressed was the 
work environment, under the focal points of rules and division of labour . 
4.1.1. The farmers ’ objectives and general reflections on AMS usage 
In total, 293 responses to the questionnaire were obtained. In order 
to study the whole milking system on the farm, only answers from those 
who defined themselves as owners are presented here. Those comprised 
207 owners (61% male, 39% female; 50% Delaval (www.delaval.com/ ), 
48% Lely (www.lely.com ), 2% SAC (www.sac.dk ). According to official 
Swedish statistics covering 77% of Swedish cows, there were 735 dairy 
companies with AMS 2021 (Vaxa, 2021 ). Following dropouts because of 
few questions answered, answers were analysed for 188 respondents, of 
which 154 also had prior experience of CMS. The results from the 
questionnaire were grouped into owners with experience of both CMS 
and AMS (n 154) and all owners (n 188). The age distribution was: 
3% D31 years, 13% aged 31–40 years, 34% aged 41–50 years, 35% aged 
51–60 years of age, and 15% aged 61–70 years. The respondents had the 
following distribution of numbers of cows: 3% of the farms had D50 
cows; 48% of the farms had 51-100 cows; 28% of the farms had 101-150 
cows; 10% of the farms had 151-200 cows; 7% of the farms had 201-300 
cows; 3% of the farms had 301-400 cows and finally 1% of the farms had 
401-500 cows. 
45% of the farms had only one robot. 32% of the farms had two 
robots, and the rest had more than two robots. Most commonly, there 
were 51–60 cows per robot (44% of farms), but 14% had a maximum of 
50 cows per robot, 36% had a range of 61–70, and 6% had more than 71 
cows per robot. Most farms had free cow traffic (62%), conventional 
production (70%) and at least one employee (83%). The interviewed 
farmers fitted the descriptions in Table 1. 
The overall picture from analysis of the data obtained in interviews, 
the questionnaire and field visits was that most farmers were positive to 
AMS usage and deployment of new technology in general. In the ques-
tionnaire, some respondents queried the robustness and functionality of 
the new technology or claimed that it is too expensive, and some had 
ethical concerns. This ethical concern considered, what he experienced 
as a focus on technology instead of animals. Two of the farmers inter-
viewed were quite critical of AMS usage. One had returned to CMS and 
the other was winding down the business due to staffing problems. In the 
questionnaire responses, more than 90% of owners with experience from 
both CMS and AMS agreed, in part that introduction of AMS had brought 
major differences in daily work, primarily with positive changes, and 
that their work satisfaction had increased (Fig. 2). 
None of the farmers interviewed mentioned income or profitability 
and just a few mentioned time saving as main reasons for introduction of 
AMS. In fact, some farmers reported that running and servicing the AMS 
was expensive and that they do not work any less with AMS. However, 
almost 90% of the questionnaire respondents with experience of both 
CMS and AMS reported that time spent per cow decreased with AMS, at 
least to some extent. In addition, more than half of the respondents who 
answered the question thought that AMS increased profitability, and 
70% had seen an increase, at least to some extent, in milk production per 
cow (Fig. 3). 
The questionnaire did not ask about motives for implementing AMS. 
Instead, it asked an open question about the greatest advantages with 
AMS. In the replies, 58% of the respondents mentioned flexibility, 41% 
mentioned improved work environment and less physical strain, and Table 2

39326% mentioned improved animal health. A few also mentioned interest 
in robot data, decreased working time, increased milk production, more 
joy in work, more time for the animals, easier to find staff and improved 
udder health. When asked why they had invested in AMS, the farmers 
interviewed gave several reasons. One said that the choice was either 
AMS or no dairy cows at all, for his own health: “I want to be able … I 
don’t want to hobble around on new hip joints … my knees must work … I 
want to be a human being ”. Improved flexibility was mentioned by others, 
possibly including flexibility in private life as robots make it possible to 
stop work early now and then. Having AMS also lowers the dependency 
on hired labour. One farmer said: “If all the staff leave … I can still keep 
going here for a while ”. Some farmers interviewed described AMS as a 
strategy to attract employees with higher competence. 
In the beginning of the AMS era, such systems often had lower pro-
duction than conventional systems in Sweden (Bergman and Rabinowicz 
(2013) , which is not the case today (https://www.vxa.se/fakta/styrnin 
g-och-rutiner/mer-om-mjolk/ ). One of the advisors explained this as 
follows: “Now dairy farmers who are interested in the animals have started to 
buy robots … in the start it was only the tech freaks who didn’t like cows … bit 
of an exaggeration … but they’re still living creatures … and they must come 
in calf in time and be taken care of.” 
4.1.2. Cows as object 
Animal welfare legislation sets rules for dairy production and care of 
individual cows, but this was beyond the scope of this study. However, 
AMS usage entails changes for the cows, with the nature of these changes 
depending on the previous and current system. The changes include 
increased demands on physical conformation of the cows, such as the 
shape of the udder and the teats, and the distance between udder and 
floor. If the cow’s appearance does not fit the robot, this could be a 
problem when milking and the cow will sooner or later be replaced. In 
cowsheds with free cow traffic, the cow has greater control over her 
daily life. The stockperson influences the cow’s needs by implementing a 
feeding strategy to attract her to behave in a certain way. Instead of 
being driven to be milked two or three times a day or standing in her 
own stall and being milked and fed without doing anything, the cow 
must choose to walk to the robot. 
In systems with guided cow traffic, the possibility for the cow to take 
responsibility and decide for herself is more limited by smart gates 
steering her way through the cowshed, but she must still walk to the 
robot. If not, sooner or later she will appear as a catch cow (or fetch cow, 
push cow) in the robot system and then be driven or helped to be milked. 
A majority of the farmers interviewed reported there was always some cow or cows who needed help or must be driven to the robot. 
High-ranking cows can be a problem for lower-ranking cows by 
impeding their access to the robot. According to one company repre -
sentative; “some [cows] are incredibly dominant and stubborn and refuse to 
let the other cows pass, so they risk disrupting the whole traffic ”. In some 
cases, farmers mentioned keeping cows with different problems (e.g. 
udders that did not fit the robot or cows posing a threat to other cows or 
stockpersons) in another cowshed with CMS. On a dairy farm with both 
AMS and CMS with a rotary milking parlour, the strategy was to let all 
heifers calve in the AMS and keep all cows in the CMS. According to the 
farmer, that resulted in 10 kg more milk per heifer in the AMS compared 
with heifers in the CMS from the beginning. The farmer attributed this to 
three instead of two milking occasions per individual in the AMS and a 
more peaceful environment. If the cow accepts and learns to be milked 
by the robot, the robot “behaves ” more predictably from one occasion to 
another than CMS operated by different persons. 
4.1.3. AMS as a tool – the milking robot as the main mediating artefact 
In AMS, the primary mediating artefact is the milking robot, 
including the computerised system/software that collects, processes and 
presents the data from the robot. According to the farmers interviewed 
here, AMS have good functionality and their credibility has increased 
over the years. Some of the farmers thought that the robots nowadays 
are very reliable. One said: “there is no tractor … nothing runs as well as our 
milking robots ”. 
A central issue in AMS usage is how to handle the cow traffic. A 
major challenge is to have highly productive cows visit the robot two to 
three times a day and then milk rapidly, without delay. The individual 
cow needs to find her own individual rhythm in order to use the robot 
optimally. Many cows per robot, slow-milking cows or dominant cows 
increase the vulnerability in the system. The number of cows per robot 
varied widely (from 45 to 75) between farms (see Table 1). 
4.1.4. Rules - handling of milking robots, AMS data and alarms alter work 
practices 
Implementation of AMS is a learning process among all involved, 
people and cows. It alters the work practices, comprising actions and 
interactions carried out when handling the milking robot. AMS com-
panies or advisors could support farmers in the initial phase with 
implementing new strategies for functional cow traffic, feeding and 
robot data follow-ups. The AMS software provides a wide range of ratios 
and an advisor could support the farmer in creating a strategy for 
selecting ratios to investigate in more detail, and how often to assess

394each ratio. The results from the questionnaire showed that a majority of 
the respondents considered that the statements “AMS require more 
computer experience than expected ” and “Much more time is spent 
sitting in front of the computer screen ” were at least partly true (Fig. 4). 
Almost 90% reported that the AMS provided data that increased their 
knowledge of the individual cow (Fig. 4). However, one advisor said: 
“there is a jungle of key data … so you need to boil these down to: It’s 
important that you do this!” Later on, other ratios can be more interesting. 
One farmer said: “Lely was really good at helping us with the lists we 
should check in the morning and those we should check at night ”. The same 
farmer remarked how valuable the robot data are: “We identify sick cows 
really quickly … We have very few cadaver cows or cows that fall seriously ill 
…. .We are so good at using the lists that we often find cases of sickness before 
the cow has become really ill.” Another aspect, reported by an advisor, 
was that it is easy to spend too much time sitting by the computer. She 
said that routines are very important to avoid this, since: “Otherwise you 
can easily spend all your time at the computer and cow care then takes place 
there ”. According to the questionnaire responses, one-third of re-
spondents felt at least some mental stress concerning interpretation and/ 
or setting up their AMS. 
Measurements and collected data from the milking robot ’s software, 
if interpreted correctly , can mediate information and increase staff 
knowledge about the cows. Data and robot information were reported to 
be used as input for discussions and contributed to learning among staff. 
AT states that a tool comes fully into being only when being used. 
Knowing when to use the collected robot data and how to use these data, 
i.e., correctly interpret the figures presented and put them into context 
based on prior knowledge, is a crucial part of tool mediation. Robot data, 
when correctly interpreted, can signal problems or act as a good man-
agement reference. Some farmers interviewed claimed that when the 
AMS actually ‘identifies ’ a sick cow, that cow should already have been 
discovered by humans walking in the herd. It should be emphasised that 
learning to interpret the collected data from the AMS is an interpretative 
sense-making process, in which prior knowledge and experience provide 
the frame of reference for reaching reasonable and sound outcomes. 
Hence, successful robot management also depends on proper actions 
taken, such as routines for taking care of the milking robot (washing, 
maintenance, service etc.) and selecting relevant data and being able to 
make credible interpretations. 
Implementation of milking robots fostered new perceptions among 
the farmers. During one of the visits, the farmers suddenly stopped 
talking because she heard a signal from one of the robots that a cow 
needed help. On another farm visit, that farmer suddenly said: “I can 
hear that the robot has problems … now I have to stop. My husband can’t 
hear the noise, but I can”. This could be considered tool-mediated hearing 
(cf. Lundstr om and Lindblom, 2018 on the topic of tool-mediated seeing ). 
Continual milking round the clock is a prerequisite for AMS, since a 
stoppage in the milking system is critical. All farmers interviewed re-
ported some stress in relation to alarms from the AMS, but differed in 
their possibilities to share responsibility for the alarms. “I can’t even go to 
the cinema without finding out, when I switch my phone back on, that it may 
have been ringing for an hour ”. It is not easy to let employees take re-
sponsibility for alarms, since they work in daytime and are employed. 
One farmer had a rather interesting solution. “We have learnt how to go on holiday … we travel as far as possible so we end up in another time zone … so 
we can have the night alarms and the like in the evening … we fly to the USA 
… there we can walk on the beach and milk cows!“. Of course they need a 
back-up person at home who can solve problems in situ, but the farmer 
claimed that many problems could be solved over the internet. Good 
routines for washing, maintenance, service etc. could minimise the 
alarms, but some will still be present. “The technology works … but the 
problem with alarms differs … we can shut off a lot of things and manage, so 
we avoid alarms … and we decide a lot ourselves ”. Nightly alarms caused at 
least some mental stress for 50% of the respondents and the rest reported 
insignificant or no stress. When responsible for the AMS all the time, 
approximately half of the respondents reported stress concerning those 
issues, but only 10% reported significant mental stress (Fig. 5). 
A great majority of respondents had experience of both CMS and 
AMS, and they considered that AMS increase udder health, animal 
welfare and cow comfort, at least to some extent (Fig. 6). One farmer 
reported that they learnt to wash the outside of the robot teat cups with 
hot water and washing-up liquid once a day, instead of just hot water, 
and suddenly milk quality considerably improved. This very small and 
certainly not high-tech or complicated intervention had a great impact: 
“No new cases of mastitis ”. Nobody had told the farmer about this 
intervention, he had to draw his own conclusions and learn. 
4.1.5. Division of labour – shifting from milker to stockperson 
On a small farm, the individual farmer must have competence in 
many areas. As the business grows, employees, partners or other family 
members can complement each other with different skills, competences 
and areas of interest, which can result in higher competence in different 
areas and less vulnerability. When the number of employees increases, 
the demand for better communication within the team also increases. 
The robot software is one such communication channel, where some or 
all personnel can interpret a cow as a catch-cow or make other decisions 
about the cows. One of the farms reported arranging a personnel 
meeting every week and had a designated Facebook group to improve 
communication. This farm had chosen AMS in order to retain their 
Swedish personnel, and the farm ’s stockperson was given much influ-
ence in planning the system from the very beginning. 
The most obvious shift in division of labour with introduction of AMS 
seemed to be the change from milker to stockperson. An advisor com-
mented: “If you have a robot … you often have personnel with more training 
… or at least experienced personnel ”. Hence, the stockperson needs a 
stockperson ’s eye, animal interest and skills to act appropriately. 
Some farmers described AMS as a strategy to get Swedish staff, as this 
facilitates communication and mutual interchange of knowledge and 
experience. Farmers wanted long-term cooperation and stable solutions 
in order to make working hours more enjoyable. “You know how it is with 
a good colleague … they lift you … you are happy about coming in to work 
and you become a better person yourself ”. The required competences were 
described as taking responsibility, having a stockperson ’s eye, thinking 
autonomously and acting on issues uncovered: “The robot system is based 
more on making your own decisions and taking care of things yourself (as 
employee) … so you need a much higher level of basic knowledge compared 
with standing in a milking pit”. 
One of the advisors interviewed summarised success factors for

Lindblom

395farmers in modern dairy production: “They must keep up with de-
velopments but still not be the kind of person who goes for everything … I 
think they must be very interested in cows and cow comfort … I think actually 
that cow comfort is the most important thing for production … and they must 
also be very interested in feed production and they must be very good at 
managing their staff … There are very few of the small businesses left and 
those that can manage their staff well, I think, they’ll be the winners in the 
future … So staff management, cow comfort and feed … I think that will take 
you a long way. ” 
A topic of particular interest was farmers ’ perceived working envi-
ronment when using AMS, which was considered an important part of 
social sustainability in this study. 
4.1.6. Outcome of AMS usage on work environment 
More than 90% of respondents to the questionnaire agreed that a 
change from CMS to AMS decreased the physical strain on farmers, at 
least to some extent. For mental stress the picture was more varied. 
Approximately one-third had experienced an increase in mental stress, 
one-third had experienced a decrease, and the remaining one-third 
experienced no difference between AMS and CMS (Fig. 7). 
Mental stress could have different causes. One of the open questions 
in the questionnaire was about the greatest challenges with AMS. The 
most common challenge reported (25% of respondents) concerned the 
robustness and operational reliability of the robots. The second most 
common challenge was managing cow traffic and the related feeding 
strategy (20%). The responses to questions grading stress-related issues 
reinforced the earlier answers, with 26% of respondents reporting sig-
nificant stress in relation to AMS vulnerability and risk of downtime and 
68% at least some stress in this regard. However, 15% reported signif -
icant stress concerning the AMS ’s operational reliability and 36% at 
least some kind of stress (Fig. 8). 
The farmers had different kinds of agreements with robot companies for service and repairs. The interviews showed that relations with rep-
resentatives of the robot companies were very important. One farmer 
said that they were the first to have AMS in their neighbourhood, in 
2008. An important reason for choosing AMS, and DeLaval as the sup-
plier, was personal contact with a representative from DeLaval, who 
helped them. If that representative had sold another brand, the farm 
would have bought that instead. “It’s about personal chemistry and trust”. 
Relations with AMS companies caused at least some stress among 25% of 
the respondents, while the corresponding figure for stress caused by 
maintenance and service of the AMS was 34% (Fig. 8). 
Finally, the respondents were asked some questions about the social 
situation in their business. More than 95% reported enjoying their work 
and more than 80% felt good in their current work situation (Fig. 9). 
Despite this high percentage of satisfied owners, many reported having 
some problems. Almost 80% believed they worked too much and 
approximately 50% felt stressed because of their workload and had some 
kind of physical problems caused by the work (Fig. 10). Almost 25% felt 
stress concerning the financial situation in the business. [It is worth 
noting that number of responses to these questions varied quite widely.] 
4.1.7. Community – focusing on advisory inputs 
The community consisted of the farmer(s), employees, the bank, 
advisors, sellers, vets, colleagues and others connected to the farm and 
providing information, knowledge or other input influencing the sub-
ject, object or tools. When a dairy farm shifts to AMS, the community 
must learn new strategies and activities, literally simultaneously as they 
are created. There is actually no competent teacher in that specific 
system, although advisors, vets or others with experience from similar 
systems can support the learning process on the farm. At the end of the 
day, the new social-technical system, with people, animals, technology 
and structures, must all adapt, or be adapted, to the local prerequisites 
(Fig. 12).

396The respondents to the questionnaire were quite satisfied with the 
advisory services they bought and a majority bought feed advice. Con-
cerning AMS data handling, there was a gap between bought advisory 
services and need for support. Approximately 50% of the farmers re-
ported needing more support to improve AMS data usage. However, less 
than 40% bought some kind of advisory service from AMS companies 
and less than 30% reported that they discuss AMS settings with their 
production advisor (Fig. 11). 
Advisors could be an important part of the farm community, but not 
all farmers paid for advisory services on milk production. One farmer 
said that they wanted to focus more on their family life, and did not have 
the time to change their work practices and learn. “We have what we need 
financially and we don’t need anything more complicated than that … we 
haven ’t time just now”. Some of the farmers were critical of advisory 
service quality. One struggled to change the advisory concept that the 
local firm offered and one bought advisory services from abroad. Some 
of the farmers were very goal-oriented, wanted continual learning in 
order to improve their production and claimed that they could not find 
what they were looking for in Sweden. Some claimed that Swedish dairy 
advisors concentrate on small and middle-sized farms, leaving the 
largest and maybe most up-front farmers to develop their production 
and business on their own: “The best farmers are driving development ”. 
Networks of other farmers or colleagues were important for all 
farmers interviewed. One said that with the telephone, Facebook and YouTube, colleagues are never far away. One of the interviewed farmers 
described with great satisfaction groups organised by advisors, where 
farmers regularly exchange experiences and data on their production. In 
a few other cases, farmers had organised such groups by themselves. 
One advisor mentioned that the bank often wanted the farmer to 
have as many animals as possible in the herd. “You think this will bring in 
a lot of money … but that’s not always the case”. She claimed that different 
farmers can handle different amounts of cows per robot “It depends partly 
on the farmer and partly on how much they trim the system … how much 
they’re involved ”. The goal is to find an optimal number of cows in the 
specific herd, with the specific staff. There is no point in having more 
cows without getting more milk. One of the farms had 70 cows per robot 
and one of their robots milked around 2850 L per day, among the best in 
Europe. However, another farmer had 50 cows per robot and said: “We 
believe that the robots should have a bit of free time … at the start we ran them 
at the limit and then we had more sick cows … those that don’t compete as 
well, they … fall through … so better with slightly fewer cows … then they 
milk more and feel better ”. That farmer had worked a lot on streamlining 
the production, but increasing the number of cows per robot was not an 
option. When they built a new cowshed, production increased: “There 
was more space, so the cows were healthier and had better feet … an extra 
milking … feed all the time and … yes most was positive for the cows … and 
they thanked us by producing more milk”. 
To summarise, this section analysed the data and defined and

397characterised the elements of the Activity System model. The bigger 
picture, about the interrelations between the components and the 
learning dimension within the AMS from a care perspective, is presented 
in the next section. 
4.2. Care practices - the outcome in the activity system 
In order to improve care and increase the viability of the farm, the 
individual farmer needs to have the motivation to learn, act and reflect. 
Learning can thus be considered a practice situated in a social-cultural 
context (Lave and Wenger, 1991 ). This learning practice is mediated 
by individual incentives and involves knowledge, tools and other re-
sources. The activity on the dairy farm and the outcome can be 
considered two sides of the care component, more or less under 
continuous learning and improvement. Thus, an ongoing care activity is 
based on attentiveness, responsiveness, knowledge, and relations 
(Krzywoszynska, 2015 ) that keep the whole socio-technical system 
running and becoming. Care help us consider AMS usage as a dynamic, 
changing and emerging practice, difficult to predict. We used the Ac-
tivity System model to highlight the developmental transformations 
involved when re-organising and re-mediating the current care activity 
at the local farm based on the contradictions that arise on shifting from 
CMS to AMS. Resolution of these contradictions could be considered a 
developmental cycle in running a dairy farm. 
4.2.1. Two different activity systems for cultivating care 
As seen in section 4.1, changing a dairy system from CMS to AMS 
results in contradictions (problems, challenges or benefits) in many 
parts of the system. The majority of farmers reported that the benefits 
outweighed the problems when changing from CMS to AMS, but a broad 
range of new ways of care needed to be developed. We identified three 
major contradictions when changing system from CMS to AMS: i) on- 
going milking round the clock, ii) cow traffic and related strategies, 
and iii) care accomplished by combining robot data with a stockperson ’s 
eye. Although these contradictions only had an impact on certain areas 
of the Activity System model (Fig. 13), the model should be considered as a web where changes in one entity result in changes being distributed 
across the whole system. 
The first contradiction is that milking goes from being a task per-
formed twice or three times a day to an operation that runs continually. 
The impact on the physical and mental work environment on study 
farms, as discussed in sub-section 4.1.6 , included both positive and 
negative changes. However, milking 24/7 means that milking are 
especially vulnerable to problems with the AMS, since a robot can only 
milk one cow at a time and, with a full schedule for the robot, there is 
little space available for recouping lost time. Dairy cows are sensitive to 
irregular milking, which can result in decreased milk production and, on 
longer time horizons, health issues. Thus, the AMS must not be inter-
rupted or, if interrupted, must be re-started quickly. Therefore, it is 
important that the farmer develops good routines, has the AMS serviced 
regularly and reacts quickly to alarms. 
The second contradiction with introduction of AMS is how to manage 
the cow traffic. Either cows move as they wish in the cowshed (free cow 
traffic) or there is a gate system that steers cow movements. A critical 
influencer of cow traffic is the feeding strategy, which should tempt the 
cow to visit the robot. Regardless of the system used, voluntary milk 
visits are essential in order to use AMS capacity effectively. To maintain 
high production, each cow must be milked two or three times a day. 
Thus, a major challenge is to have cows with udders that fit the robot 
and that are also highly productive and voluntarily visit the robot two to 
three times a day, milking fast without delay. 
The third and most important contradiction in care of an AMS farm 
concerns the change from looking at every cow and touching every 
udder to letting the robot do the milking and making use of robot data, in 
combination with a stockperson ’s eye, in order to develop good care. 
First, decisions must be made concerning what data to look at and when, 
and how to interpret these data, in order to provide good care. The 
digital robot software can provide much data, but cannot measure cow 
health directly. Hence, a person needs to interpret the information from 
the software and relate the information to prior experience and acquired 
knowledge, as well as having first-hand contact with the cows. Therefore 
a stockperson ’s eye is still needed in AMS (Fig. 14). When robots have 
Fig. 12.Images from the field visits.  
Fig. 13.A change in dairy system from conventional (CMS) to automated milking (AMS) requires adaptation, learning and thus a change in care. Contradictions 
could be problems, challenges or potential for change. Identified contradictions depicted in the Activity System model are: A) Physical strain, B) limited access to cow 
data, C) stockperson ’s eye, D) milking 24/7 and use and interpretation of robot data, and E) cow traffic and related issues. It should be emphasised that the con-
tradictions are present between the same entities in CMS and AMS, but the content of the contradictions differs. C. Lundstr om and J. Lindblom

398taken over the milking, time and space for development and use of a 
stockperson ’s eye must be incorporated in other kinds of daily work or 
by spending time in the herd, to complement the available robot data. 
According to one of the advisors interviewed, “(AMS) actually needs a 
better stockperson ’s eye”. That was confirmed in the questionnaire, where 
almost 70% reported a greater need for a stockperson ’s eye to some 
extent on changing from CMS to AMS (Fig. 14). Just a few percent 
believed that this requirement decreased to some extent when imple -
menting AMS. One farmer expressed it like this: “The robot system works 
really well if you want to be half a day too late all the time … because all facts 
are based on the cow having visited a feed station or a robot … that’s where it 
transmits all information on the amount of milk it produces, or how much it 
weighs or how much it eats … a sick cow doesn ’t go to the feeding station, a 
sick cow doesn ’t go to get milked … so you don’t react until it’s too late!” 
Accordingly, robot data alone are not sufficient for provision of good 
care, while the same is true for a stockperson ’s eye alone. In Fig. 15, the 
AT lens is applied to two Activity System models based on two different 
mediating artefacts: robot data and a stockperson ’s eye. It is clear that 
neither kind of care is good enough on its own, rather both kinds are 
needed. Another farmers said: ““You can’t gauge the general condition of 
the cow from data”, and continued: “ … when you enter a robot system you 
have to have that feeling that something might be wrong … go up and check, 
temperature … then you can react early and prevent the cow from getting very 
sick”. One of the farmers interviewed claimed that the robot is a decision 
support system, meaning that one cannot depend on the technology 
alone to obtain a good result, but it can certainly support and act as a 
good check-up tool (Fig. 16). 
With many cows in the herd, it is difficult for the stockperson to 
recognise all individuals. However, one farmer said: “We spend much 
more time on the animals now [compared with CMS] , we don’t need to talk 
to each individual cow … and each individual might not want to talk to us … 
and they are very clear about that … but we have one who always wants to 
engage and help … and who comes and tells you in the morning if something 
has happened … she runs over and stands there by the gate … then you know 
there is a calf on the floor or something ”. This farmer did not recognise all 
the individual cows in the herd, but she did recognise the very social 
cows. Likewise, she and others recognised cows repeatedly listed as 
catch cows. Thus, relations between the stockperson and cows within a 
herd depend much on the individuals (both cows and humans). Catch- 
cows are reported by the robot and identified by the cow’s unique number. Cows that want to be scratched or stroked or that want to ‘tell’ 
the stockperson something try to communicate with the stockperson, 
and the stockperson must be attentive and have the competence to 
interpret and respond adequately to the cows ’ behaviour. This demands 
relations between humans and non-humans, in examples of mutual care. 
For stockpersons with a poor or limited eye for stock, such relations will 
not be developed. As one of the farmers stated: “Not everyone has it”. 
Unfortunately, those who don’t have it won ’t miss it, or will find it 
difficult to develop. 
4.2.2. Requirement of care competence among advisors 
Advisors also need experience and a stockperson ’s eye. In one 
interesting example, a farmer talked about a very competent foreign 
advisor who wanted to see the wholeness and started the visit with 
approximately 1 h by himself in the cowshed. “How the cows are, and the 
like … that gives him an idea of whether it’s working … or not working. He 
doesn ’t need to see any figures and things … he sees that in the cowshed … 
how many are lying, how many are ruminating, what the manure looks like … 
the coat … that gives him a feeling for when things aren’t right … … then he 
starts to check the data … milk yield, feed, diseases and the like”. This is an 
example of a person first using his attentiveness, experience and 
knowledge to provide advice concerning care for dairy cows. Later, 
different sources of robot data are used as input to the discussions, which 
also requires theoretical knowledge, to support the farmer in a broad 
range of topics. 
One advisor said that she started with a university degree in agri-
culture and then worked for eight years in practice in Sweden and 
abroad. “Then I changed sides. ” She commented that she had gained 
experience both from dairy production and from being the farmer in an 
advisor-farmer relation: “Piecemeal advice is not good! ” but “it’s difficult to 
cover everything ”. 
Automated milking systems, or other systems that provide a lot of 
data (Dela Rue et al., 2019 ), change farmers ’ need for support. Data that 
were previously handled, interpreted and presented to the farmer by 
advisors are now produced, interpreted and available on the farm. This 
changes the role and possibly the power relation between advisor and 
farmer. 
One farmer made a comparison between crop production and dairy 
production advisors. “I would say that crop production and economics are 
easier than the production side … [milk production] is tricky … many crop

399advisors have their own farm, and grow crops and test products … so even it if 
it is at hobby level, they are passionate about their work … but there are no 
young women who work as production advisors and run their own dairy 
farm ”. Thus, first-hand experience-based competence must come 
through their work as an advisor, so 1) farmers play a central role in 
educating advisors; and 2) it is easier to start an advisory career with 
interventions and support related to some kind of robot data or control. 
Another farmer expressed it thus: “Unfortunately today there are many 
very young [advisors] with little experience from their own farm … so you 
have to sit and teach the advisor about a lot of things … and pay 900 Krona 
an hour for that”. 
To summarise, care in dairy farming is a complex matter. As one 
farmer said concerning what it takes to be a successful dairy farmer: “It’s 
quite complex to run a farm like this. You have to go to school and learn 
things … you have to think that it’s interesting to calculate and see connec -
tions here and there … many think that you’re only a farmer, but it’s not that 
easy, you have to be an all-rounder and know a lot … you have to be an 
economist and a stockman, handle technology … you should also have a 
social network … to cope … to ring for help”. New care processes need to be 
developed for everyone involved, humans and non-humans in an 
ongoing learning process. This care encompasses robot data, which are 
used as input for making proper decisions on results to check at different 
intervals and in interpretation of viewed data, to plan feeding strategy 
and cow traffic, teach cows how to be milked, choose regular intervals of 
service for the AMS, handle alarms, find staff and advisors if needed and 
finally combine information from robot software or other devices with a 
stockperson ’s eye, in order to provide as good conditions for the cows as 
possible. 
5.Discussion 
The care perspective applied in this study to robot milking is opposed 
to the dominant technology-oriented view on agricultural production, 
commonly referred under labels like smart farming, digital agriculture 
and agriculture 4.0 (e.g. Ayre et al., 2019 ; Clay et al., 2020 ; Finstad 
et al., 2021 ; Klerkx et al., 2019 ; Lioutas et al., 2019 ; Rijswijk et al., 
2021 ). Applying the care perspective emphasised the need to use a 
systemic perspective in farming, which were stated by, for instance, 
Darnhofer (2021) , Klerkx et al. (2019) and Rijswijk et al. (2021) . Using 
the perspective of care, considers the interdependencies between 
farmers and the technologies in robot milking (Finstad et al., 2021 ; 
Rijswijk et al., 2021 ), because AMS provides meaning only when it is 
enrolled in its work practices (Suchman, 2007 ). Applying the 
socio-technical perspective to dairy farming implies that the AMS is 
dependent on the farmer ’s work practice in which it will be imple -
mented and used in such a way that it shapes the nature of the work 
practices of running a dairy farm (Finstad et al., 2021 ; Rijswijk et al., 2021 ). We applied the care perspective because of its criticism of the 
technocratic and productivist paradigm (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ), 
where care is characterised as the result of all practices that make 
technology and knowledge work, considering care as a patterning of 
activities. 
The aim to study Swedish farmers ’ experiences and reflections from 
the perspective of care in dairy farming using AMS was examined here 
based on two research questions: 1) What kinds of success factors and 
management challenges do farmers experience with AMS usage? and 2) 
How do farmers view their work environment in this kind of system? 
We used AT to enable a more structured approach to investigating 
and analysing care in the socio-technical system of AMS in dairy 
farming. The focus in AT on studying contradictions during technology 
mediation also provided insights for learning and development when 
shifting from CMS to AMS, aspects well-aligned with care. 
The majority of farmers who participated in the study saw more 
advantages than disadvantages with AMS. A possible bias is that farmers 
who have made large investments in AMS might focus on the advan -
tages. However, the obvious improvements in physical health and 
workload for the majority of the farmers, despite increased mental stress 
caused by frequent alarms, the increased profitability and milk pro-
duction for most farms provide a positive picture of AMS in Swedish 
dairy production. However, farmers also reported poor service from the 
AMS companies, problems concerning the entire management on the 
farm and challenges to find competent employees as well as advisors. 
The findings showed the importance of local adaptation. The main 
starting point was the interests, motives, knowledge and experience of 
those responsible for milk production. There was no general ‘truth ’ 
concerning e.g. the optimal number of cows per milking robot. Some 
farmers preferred to intensify production by having many cows per 
robot, while others chose a lower number of cows per robot to increase 
cow health and cow comfort, thus increasing milk yield per cow. Vari-
ation in the number of cows per robot was also reported in a survey of 
Canadian dairy farms (range 27–72 cows per robot, median 52) (Tse 
et al., 2017 ). Different farmers have different motives and goals for their 
businesses, as long as they consider it viable. High milk production and 
profitability are not the only motives for a farmer, e.g. cow comfort, 
flexibility in work hours, work satisfaction etc. are other relevant 
motives. 
5.1. Contributions, challenges and need for an interest in animals and a 
stockperson ’s eye 
The most important finding of the study was the need for a stock -
person ’s eye or a professional vision (Goodwin, 1994 ) regarding cows. 
Less surprising was the need for tool-mediated seeing (Goodwin and 
Goodwin, 1996 ), to choose and to use robot data in a value-creating

400way. Even though milking robots provide much data, the stockperson ’s 
eye cannot be replaced. Thus, professional vision and enhanced profes -
sional vision (Lundstr om and Lindblom, 2018 ) using robot data are 
needed in order to use AMS effectively. In this context, tool-mediated 
seeing (Goodwin and Goodwin, 1996 ) means being able to interpret 
credible robot data and apply the outcomes in care for cows. This study 
identified two examples of tool-mediated hearing , when a farmer could 
hear that the robot needed “help ”. 
On implementing AMS, farmers working with robot data enter a 
continuous learning process, in which they start to recognise what data 
to focus on and learn how to apply and use it in practice to manage the 
individual cow and the herd. This means that farmers develop tool- 
mediated seeing in order to improve their professional vision (Goodwin, 
1994 ). The experienced farmer ’s combined professional vision and 
tool-mediated seeing emerge from the process of learning to choose, 
interpret and correctly use data from computerised technology like 
AMS, which we call enhanced professional vision (Lundstr om and Lind-
blom, 2018 ). To be successful in dairy production, farmers need to adapt 
their practice and technology to the local situation, thus improving their 
care, where care is the sum of all practices that make technology and 
knowledge work (Krzywoszynska, 2015 ). 
Another way to express this is that AMS is not for high-tech farmers, 
but for cow farmers (Driessen and Heutinck, 2015 ). This was obvious 
from the responses in interviews and to the questionnaire, and has also 
been mentioned by others (Butler et al., 2012 ). The robot technology can 
be used as an expert system, a decision support system (Lindblom et al., 
2017 ) or for check-ups. Our results show that AMS technology cannot 
supersede human experience and a stockperson ’s eye in providing good 
care in milk production. To use AMS effectively, farmers also need to 
develop their enhanced professional vision (Lundstr om and Lindblom, 
2018 ) to choose and interpret robot data in specific situations in an 
on-going learning process. Consequently, good care in AMS dairy pro-
duction must be based on AMS data and on interest in animals and a 
stockperson ’s eye. This applies to the farmer, the stockperson and the 
advisor. The challenge for educators and the dairy industry is to facili -
tate more systemic training of future farm staff and dairy production 
advisors. 
There are training opportunities available for people working with 
cows concerning the skill to read cow behaviour. For example, Vaxa 
Sverige, the largest advisory service company for dairy production in 
Sweden, educates animal handlers in reading so-called cow signals, i.e. 
how to interpret cow behaviour (https://www.vxa.se/ ). However, 
reading cow signals is a rather technical description concerning cow 
behaviour, which needs to be recognised and then interpreted and acted 
accurately upon. In order to interpret the signals from cows, the indi-
vidual needs attentiveness, experience and knowledge of cows, which 
are the key elements in the care perspective. 
The care perspective builds on the ethics of care (Gilligan, 1977 ) as a 
relational matter, i.e. not as acting on, but rather living with (Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2017 ). Care ethics do not build on roles and moral principles, 
but on interdependent, contextual relations in practice, in the vicinity, in 
relations where people have or take responsibility (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2017 ). Instead of rules or moralities, care ethics build on compassion, 
sympathy, relations and mutual dependency (Lonkila, 2021 ; Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2017 ), creating good solutions in practice within a local sit-
uation (Mol et al., 2010 ). To care is to be in a relationship with humans, 
non-humans and/or natural settings, and continually develop relevant 
patterning of activities. 
In the technological fix approach (Black, 2000 ), which is 
well-aligned with the dominant technology-oriented view on agricul -
tural production, some challenges persist. In our view, there is a lack of 
ongoing discussion concerning the requirements for establishing good 
relations built on mutual dependency between the user of technology 
and the non-human or natural setting in which the technology facilitates 
action in order to deliver good care. The possibilities to build (mutual) 
good relations through a filter of technology, i.e. by tool-mediated seeing , are currently limited. On the contrary, there is a risk of the rapid and 
recent implementation of technology increasing the distance between 
humans, non-humans and natural settings that they act upon. According 
to AT, the tools used, i.e., AMS as the main mediating artefact, should 
not be viewed as an interaction device between the farmer (subject) and 
the cows (object). Rather, the interaction with cows is mediated by the 
AMS. Consequently, the use of technology increases the need for alter-
native strategies for creating mediating relations. Based on our findings, a 
relation-creating strategy with AMS might be spending time within the 
herd, and systematically observing the cows. It is possible to use AMS 
without other forms of relation creation, but the result will not be very 
satisfactory, as is obvious from the results in this study. Since the 
experienced dairy farmer with a good stockperson ’s eye knows the 
importance of contact with individual cows (i.e. relation creation), they 
develop strategies to achieve this. 
Using care as a perspective forced us to think of mutual dependences 
and relations to humans, non-humans or natural settings in the case of 
AMS. Use of technology also increases the need for new relation-creating 
strategies among decision makers with responsibility for strategic de-
cisions, who must have an understanding of the importance of reciprocal 
relationships. As Mol et al. (2010: p 15) state: “Technologies …. do not 
work or fail in and of themselves. Rather, they depend on care work ”. 
Without understanding and insights into the dependence on relation -
ships with humans, non-humans and natural settings, it is easy to 
overlook the fact that performed measures are necessary, but not suffi-
cient, to cultivate good care. AMS is a very clear example of connections 
that exist everywhere, but are not always noticed. AMS is an animal- 
dependent operation using technology, but cows are high-value in-
dividuals with possibilities to live long lives. Cow comfort or a holistic 
view on the dairy system is important to achieve business viability. 
Dairy farmers often have a great interest in animals and a stockperson ’s 
eye, and thus understand the value of human-cow relations. The need for 
good care based on relations between humans, non-humans and natural 
settings also arises for instance in crop production. However, the con-
nections and mutual dependencies are probably not as obvious as with 
cows in AMS. Cow comfort and soil health are interrelated by the holistic 
perspective, but the cow is much easier to recognise, acknowledge and 
relate to than the very small creatures in the soil. Cow comfort also has a 
direct and obvious influence on farm profitability, in both the long and 
short term, while soil health is much more elusive. Nevertheless, the 
care perspective shows that a relational approach towards non-humans 
and natural settings, based on attentiveness, experience and respon -
siveness, could be valuable in a broad range of agricultural topics. We 
are hopeful that the socio-technical systems approach to dairy farming 
with AMS will have additional attention, as recent publications within 
the field emphasise the need for studying the work practices from a 
systemic perspective (Darnhofer, 2020 ; Finstad et al., 2021 ; Rijswijk 
et al., 2021 ). We interpret recent attempts from what Rijswijk et al. 
(2021) call socio-cyber interactions and socio-physical interactions as a 
perspective of care. 
5.2. Limitations 
The scope of this study was narrow and there were some limitations 
that could have influenced the results. For example: i) No farmer with 
only one robot was interviewed, but single robot farmers was the 
dominating group among questionnaire respondents. ii) The inter-
viewed farmers came from a limited area within Sweden. iii) The field 
visits were limited in scope due to the pandemic. iv) All results from the 
questionnaire are not reported in this paper. Finally, v) since there is no 
Swedish actor with statistics on all Swedish AMS farmers, we chose to 
use newsletters from the two dominating AMS companies and a Face-
book group for AMS farmers to invite respondents to answer the ques-
tionnaire. Swedish farmers are well educated and due to an investigation 
2021, 73% of all Swedish farmers used digital tools for communication 
and 87% have rather good or very good internet connection on their C. Lundstr om and J. Lindblom                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Journal of Rural Studies 87 (2021) 386–403
401farms (lantbrukspanel_maj_2021_den-digitala-lantbrukaren.pdf (land -
shypotek.se). That was the main reason for us to use digital newsletters 
and Facebook to reach the farmers, even though we realised that it may 
have precluded some AMS farmers from answering the questionnaire. 
This strategy also, made it impossible to calculate a response rate. 
However, this study do not claim any generalisability, rather it has a 
descriptive approach. Despite these weaknesses in collection and anal-
ysis of the data, the results are interesting and provide deeper knowledge 
and insights into the socio-technical system of AMS in dairy production. 
The purpose of using a mixed methods research design conducted via 
triangulation was to combine several sources of quantitative and qual-
itative data to reveal how care on dairy farms with AMS was manifested. 
This research design and analysis of the collected data is rather 
descriptive, and aims to provide initial step towards an increased un-
derstanding of how care is manifested as a socio-technical system of 
dairy farming via an AT lens. The AT lens was mainly due to the care 
perspective not having its own analytic method. The analysis was 
inspired by thematic analysis but constantly informed by AT and its focal 
points and their interrelatedness. However, there were trade-offs be-
tween the level of granularity for the analysis and the concepts included 
in the analysis due to the scope of the paper. Our main focus was on care 
as the main activity, and future work could go into much more detail 
about how the patterning of activities are realised in practice via the 
entities and basic principles in the AT framework at several farmers with 
AMS. The AT lens proved suitable for the analysis, and the Activity 
System model visualised the main contradictions within the socio- 
technical system of dairy farming. Using AT as a lens for studying 
care, including the Activity System model, forced us to pay attention to 
all entities in the model and interrelations that might otherwise have 
been neglected, as well as focusing on the learning and development 
perspective originating in the notion of contradictions. However, there 
were some limitations with the use of AT, e.g. it can be rather 
cumbersome to apply and, as in Rogers (2012) , it was used here as a 
conceptual tool-making sense of a dairy domain rather than for offering 
ready-made answers. While AT is one of the most prominent approaches 
used for studying socio-technical systems, its success still relies on the 
analyst ’s skill in interpretation and orientation when analysing the 
collected data and relating these to AT concepts (Lindblom and Alenl -
jung, 2020 ; Rogers, 2012 ). Therefore, it takes time to obtain an 
acceptable level of understanding and competence in using AT appro -
priately. However, the structure provided by the AT lens and the Activity 
System model offered a viable way to unravel several aspects of the care 
perspective. 
5.3. Future work 
This study suffered from limitations regarding the amount and 
duration of field visits on dairy farms with AMS. Future work should 
involve more extensive ethnographic studies with participatory obser -
vations on one or a couple of specific farms, in order to collect more in- 
depth data and gain further insights on care. Future work should also 
involve a deeper theoretical analysis of the relations between the care 
perspective and the entities and basic principles of the AT lens, in order 
to confirm that the approach used in this study can provide viable in-
sights on how technology such as AMS is integrated into the work 
practices on the farm. 
Some farmers reported mental stress in handling and interpreting 
robot data. Examination of farmers ’ digital work environment, by 
integration of knowledge and methods from Human-computer interac -
tion (HCI), in particular from a user experience (UX) perspective, is one 
future need of research. In HCI, researchers study and evaluate the 
quality of interaction in a systematic way (ISO 9241 –210:2019 ; Lind-
blom and Alenljung, 2020 ). 
Future work could also apply the care perspective through an AT lens 
to other agricultural systems. If farming should be considered as: “an 
ongoing and open process of transformation, involving manifold humans and nonhumans who are themselves conceptualised as processes connected to 
other processes. “ (Darnhofer, 2021 , p. 15) and “The aim is thus to identify 
and better understand how relations and constellations enable or impair 
transformation and change, how these relations are constantly made and 
remade, stabilised or undone ” (Darnhofer, 2021 , p. 15). Then, the 
perspective of care, analysed with AT, would be a valuable tool and a 
possible way forward. 
To conclude, the obtained contributions in this paper emphasise the 
need to consider the rapid increase of digitalisation in agriculture 
beyond the technocratic paradigm. In a similar vein as addressed in the 
emergence of Industry 5.0 (Longo et al., 2020 ), we want to highlight the 
need for a similar emerging Agriculture 5.0, which we view as taking 
more profound care perspective. Industry 5.0 is characterised as an 
approach that focuses on the symbiotic relationship between technology 
and humans as well as addressing the need for putting the farmers and 
their work practices, ethical issues, and value-based aspects back at the 
centre of attention. 
6.Conclusions 
By focusing on the ongoing transformation of actions that charac -
terise handling of contradictions as expansive cycles of learning, appli -
cation of an Activity System model to dairy farming revealed that the 
work practice of care is constantly evolving when using AMS. The ac-
tivity of managing a dairy farm for producing milk is continual, and the 
alterations and modifications of the milking robot and its related tools 
change work practices, in turn re-shaping the tools used in dairy farm 
management. 
6.1. Success factors and challenges in AMS 
In successful dairy farming with AMS, willingness to learn, adapt to 
the local situation and continually improve practices seem to be the most 
important factors. This requires learning strategies for the farmer and 
strategies to get support from others, e.g. on feeding strategy, crop 
production, interpretation of data, cow comfort, service of technology 
etc. Conditions will differ depending on farm size and number of people 
involved. With more people involved, knowledge and competence could 
be differentiated. In that case, competent people who understand why 
things are done, are attentive and then act upon what they have found 
are needed. This study revealed the importance of experience and a 
stockperson ’s eye, in combination with tool-mediated seeing , for devel -
oping enhanced professional vision and good care in dairy farming. A good 
stockperson has broad competence, combining a systemic view of cow 
health and comfort, assessed using a stockperson ’s eye, and experience 
with robot data. Finding competent staff for AMS farms is a major 
challenge. Another challenge is finding advisors with experience and 
broad competence in AMS dairy production. Combining robot-mediated 
seeing with a stockperson ’s eye is demanding, but is an important 
component of achieving good care in AMS dairy production, whether 
farmer, stockperson or advisor. 
6.2. Farmers ’ experience of work environment in AMS 
Increased flexibility in work and better physical health appear to be 
important driving forces for implementing AMS. Handling alarms was 
mentally stressful for almost half of the respondents to the question -
naire. Other issues that caused mental stress were perceived AMS vul-
nerabilities. A questionnaire-based survey clearly showed that AMS had 
brought major, primarily positive, changes in daily work and increased 
work satisfaction for most farmers. More than 80% of the respondents 
reported feeling good in their work situation and enjoying their work.
