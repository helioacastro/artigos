ABSTRACT
This article delves into the intricate dynamics of air data ﬁcation as
matters of care within the distinctive context of air quality data
politics in Poland. It focuses on the implementation of data-
mediated care for air quality, scrutinizing two interconnecteddimensions: data practices and data phronesis. The former
involves the meticulous handling of air quality data, while the
latter explores the phronetic valuation of more-than-humanrealms, including data standards, air sensing technologies, and a
diverse array of actors integral to the data ﬁcation process. Data
phronesis is conceptualized as the situated and context-dependent practical wisdom demonstrated by various actors,
shaping the de ﬁnition of ‘good ’data-mediated care for air
quality. The article emphasizes the duality of care, highlighting
the interplay between data phronesis and data practices. It
underscores the ongoing negotiation surrounding air quality
concerns, intricately mediated through data, within relational and
contextual dimensions. Through an in-depth qualitativeexamination and Reﬂexive Thematic Analysis, four key themes,
related to data-mediated air quality care, are identi ﬁed: ‘caring
about data, ’involving the valuation of situated data practices;
‘caring for data, ’translating polluted air into reliable data, while
considering dominant standards; ‘caring by data, ’deﬁning data
usage methods within dynamic contexts; and ‘data for caring, ’
exploring practical applications, particularly activist practices
integrating diverse local contexts with European air quality
standards. The article enriches our understanding of data ﬁcation
as matters for care, shedding light on the interconnections
between hands-on data practices and the contextual wisdom
steering strategic action.ARTICLE HISTORY

matter of care (de la Bellacasa, 2017 ; Gabrys, 2022 ; Pink, 2022 ) within the Polish context
of air quality data politics. It speciﬁ cally focuses on how data-mediated care for air quality
is realized in two interconnected dimensions: data practices and data phronesis

air quality data, and the phronetic valuation of more-than-human worlds (de la Bellacasa,
2017 ; Mol et al., 2010 ) composed of data standards, air sensing technologies, and diverse
actors participating in the process of the dataﬁ cation of air. Data phronesis is understood
as the situated and context-dependent practical wisdom of various actors that determines
how de ﬁnitions of ‘good ’data-mediated care for air quality are created.
In the article, I posit that the process of air dataﬁ cation ultimately involves the
conversion of air pollution into data, with the aim of quantifying risks and guidingprescriptive actions (Pink, 2022 , p. 75). This process is upheld through the e ﬀorts of pub-
lic and scientiﬁ c institutions, as well as the activities of grassroots social movements.
Therefore, the dataﬁcation of air as a matter of care can be comprehended as mainten-ance and repair practices using the data and dataﬁ cation technologies necessary to pre-
serve, sustain, and restore our breathable world ‘so that we can live in it as well as
possible ’(de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 3). These practices of collecting air pollution data
serve as documentation of harm and are employed as a means of generating care for
air quality (Gabrys, 2022 , p. 105).
However, air quality data is not universal, but rather determined by context and
relationships (Loukissas, 2019 ;Ślosarski, 2023 ), and their valuation is based on data
phronesis. Data phronesis reveals the vulnerability of data as facts, and emphasizestheir collective signi ﬁcance, supported by networks of both human and non-human
actors. The concept of ‘matters of care ’considers the three Aristotelian intellectual vir-
tues together (Aristotle, 2015 ). It focuses on episteme as the means of constructing knowl-
edge and cognition, on techne as the construction of sociotechnical assemblages, as well
as addressing issues of situated ethics as a key aspect of caring for the representation of
things. The aim of the article is to strengthen this third aspect by proposing to study
phronesis as situated practical wisdom that determines how de ﬁnitions of good care
are created, thus inﬂ uencing practices. This category adds to the understanding of care
by indicating how valuation is realized and linked to practices that involve adapting to
various technologies and contexts. Data phronesis enables us to capture the diverse sen-
sibilities of actors, thereby highlighting the power dynamics among them, determining
whose values hold greater importance, and how certain vulnerable actors, such as localactivists, adapt in relation to other actors while creatively navigating between standards
and contexts. The category of phronesis facilitates the consideration of values and prac-
tices within the relational process of sustaining diverse more-than-human worlds, as willbe exempli ﬁed by the case of air pollution in Poland.
In a theoretical sense, the article aims to contribute to the problem of the ‘double
vision of care ’(Lindén & Lydahl, 2021 ), speci ﬁcally regarding an ethico-political issue
of what worlds are composed and sustained by air quality data (de la Bellacasa, 2017 ,
p. 44), as well as which ‘good ’practices using air sensing technologies are expected to
be ‘handled with
care ’(Mol, 2008 , p. 5) in order to have a meaningful impact in
object-oriented politics (Marres, 2015 ). To understand this double vision, the concept
of phronesis (Eubanks, 2012 ; Flyvbjerg, 2013 ), which refers to practical wisdom and
the valuation of practices, technologies, and power relations between human and non-human actors, will be applied in the context of air data ﬁcation. This approach o ﬀers a
non-idealized understanding of care in critical studies of data and air pollution, while
also highlighting the ability to analyze situated data practices (Kitchin, 2022 ). In an
empirical sense, the article will explore the Polish data ﬁcation of air, focusing on mattersINFORMATION, COMM UNICATION & SOCIETY 759
of care in terms of practical engagement in data production and use, and examining
‘good ’practices through the lens of data phronesis as practical judgments. I will focus
on the network of organizations comprising the Polish Smog Alert. These organizations
are striving to exert inﬂ uence on the course of air quality policy by using data and
engaging in various relationships with other actors, including public measurement
institutions and scientists who research air pollution in Poland. For local activists,
however, handling data is not simply about using it in their practice. It also entails asituated practical wisdom –data phronesis –which involves recognizing the value
of data and technologies, while also considering how these things are valued by otheractors.
In the next section, I will formulate a theoretical contribution related to data phronesis
by conducting a literature review regarding matters of care and air quality data politics.Subsequently, in the following section, I will introduce fundamental aspects related to theempirical context of Polish air quality data politics, demonstrating how data practices
and data phronesis manifest in the Polish context. Finally, I will discuss the results in
the context of the previously outlined concepts.
The duality of care: practice and phronesis in air quality data politics
A range of scholarly works shed light on di ﬀerent aspects of matters of care in critical
data studies, including the practices (Fotopoulou, 2019 ; Meng et al., 2019 ), infrastruc-
tures and technologies (Gray & Witt, 2021 ; Slota et al., 2023 ) or imagined futures associ-
ated with it (Ruckenstein & Trifuljesko, 2022 ). Building upon previous studies that have
predominantly explored the intersection of techne/episteme in the study of data-mediated care and caring ethics of research, I argue that we should also amplify issuesof data phronesis, which pertain to situated and context-dependent practical wisdom
determining how de ﬁnitions of ‘good care’ are created, thus inﬂ uencing practices.
In the ﬁeld of air quality data politics (Marzecová & Husberg, 2022 ), the issue of data-
mediated care for air has gained prominence. According to Gabrys ( 2022 , p. 105), citizen-
sensing practices in monitoring air pollution express concern for breathable worlds.
These practices speculatively aim to document harm and advocate for care, operatingindependently from o ﬃcial public infrastructures, and encouraging corrective actions;
but their political engagements often lack speci ﬁc outcomes such as immediate regu-
lation, policy, or consensus on environmental issues (Gabrys, 2022 , p. 105). The latter
is often associated with the category of ‘just good enough data’ , suggesting that data
usage alone can be adequate in creating awareness about air pollution (Gabrys et al.,
2016 ), but may not be enough to bring about a signi ﬁcant impact on public institutional
policies ( Ślosarski, 2023 ). The contradiction between data practices aimed at caring for
air quality and the question of having su ﬃciently ‘good ’data to e ﬀectively implement
or inﬂ uence those caring practices is a crucial aspect of comprehending the interplay
between data practices and data phronesis in the realm of air quality policy, as will be
shown in the case of Polish air quality data politics. However, before delving into this,
I will examine the dataﬁcation of air, drawing upon existing research in this domain.
Matters of care ultimately involve representing things as vulnerable, interconnected,
and predominantly dependent on often neglected maintenance work, as well as ethical
obligations that lead to the speciﬁ c aesthetic articulation of politically demanding issues760 B.ŚLOSARSKI
(de la Bellacasa, 2017 , pp. 56 –57). Care is fundamentally dualistic in nature because, on
one hand, it entails active practical engagement and material actions, and on the other
hand, it embodies an ethical responsibility for things (de la Bellacasa, 2015 , p. 90).
This understanding has consequences for the way care is conceptualized. First, the
issue of the double vision of care (Lindén & Lydahl, 2021 ) is conceptualized as an
ethico-political concern regarding the composition and sustenance of worlds throughmaterial practices (de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 44), as well as the identi ﬁcation of ‘good ’prac-
tices for addressing speci ﬁc issues with care (Mol, 2008 , p. 5). This duality of care, as both
a practice and a world-composition, is always situated within a particular terrain charac-terized by power relations, exclusions, and marginalization (Lindén & Lydahl, 2021 , p. 4).
Second, care is understood as practical tinkering or a process aimed at ﬁnding local sol-
utions to the challenge of reconciling the coexistence of diverse human and non-humanactors in real-world scenarios (Mol et al., 2010 ). It involves working with socio-technical
elements to improve situations and address the complexities inherent in balancing mul-
tiple values and objectives (Lavau & Bingham, 2017 ). As highlighted by Mol et al. ( 2010 ,
p. 13), the practice of caring necessitates the reconciliation of diverse understandings of
‘good care ’through practical experimentation and adaptation. The qualiﬁ cation of what
constitutes good care is not a separate process preceding its implementation; rather, it is
integrated into the very act of providing care –instead of critically evaluating the notion
of goodness from an external perspective, those involved in caring must actively under-
take actions to bring that ‘ideal ’to fruition, while actively engaging in their tasks (Mol
et al., 2010 , p. 13). It means that the practice of caring itself is relationally and contex-
tually bounded (Gill et al., 2017 ).‘Good care’ is context-dependent and its very de ﬁnition
is an object of ongoing negotiation in the realm of the more-than-human world (Gill,
2017 ). Therefore, care is ‘relational per se ’(de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 69); however, in
order to study it empirically in a situated way we should start from practices, discovering
their material, relational, and contextual interdependencies (Fotopoulou, 2019 ).
In air quality data politics, we can observe this interrelationship between data practice,
as practical tinkering with data, and data phronesis, as value judgments of air pollutiondata. This duality includes both the practices of handling data and the concept of dataphronesis, which entails valuing these practices and making practical judgments that
consider materiality, context, and various relationships.
The handling of air quality data is one aspect of the spectrum. Data practices are rela-
tional, involving various actors ( Ślosarski, 2023), and contextual, because these relation-
ships unfold di ﬀerently in speci ﬁcsettings (Loukissas, 20
 19). In this realm, we are
dealing with a multiplicity of actors and their data ﬁcation practices. We can identify
speciﬁc practices employed by public institutions, which focus on the administrative
logic of air governance (Kunz & Hornidge, 2022). Scientists conduct basic research within
thisﬁeld, while data activists or citizen scientists generate knowledge to evidence harms
(Gabrys, 2022) and understand their localities, or conduct ‘undone science ’(Hess, 2016).
Furthermore, market players concentrate on establishing a speci ﬁc market for selling air
puriﬁers and other commodities as individual and commercial responses to the issue of
air pollution (Negi & Srigyan, 2021). This stream of research perceives actors as ful ﬁlling
the fundamental criterion of matters of care, as they actively contribute to the understand-ing and acknowledgment of air pollution as a constructed fact and represented entity. They
also express varying degrees of ethical responsibility for air quality, albeit with di ﬀerentINFORMATION, COMM UNICATION & SOCIETY 761
visions and interpretations. Moreover, this line of research implies that the practices them-
selves, regarded as local tinkering involving conscious adjustments to speci ﬁc contexts and
relational interdependencies, are complex, uneven, frequently contradictory, and give rise
to con ﬂicts among divergent practices (Crooks & Currie, 2021).
At the opposite end of the data handling spectrum lies everything that impacts and
inﬂuences these practices. This includes the concept of phronesis as a value judgment per-
taining to practices that are contextually and relationally situated. In air quality data poli-tics, the understanding of the topic is multifarious, ﬁrstly encompassing regimes of
perceptibility and the politicization of air as a contested political space (Calvillo, 2018). Sec-
ondly, there is contention regarding the concept of ‘just good enough data ’which involves
using diverse sensors, including low-cost ones, to go beyond traditional perspectives and
engage with air pollution from multiple angles (Gabrys et al., 2016). Thirdly, interpreting
data of varying quality requires an awareness of potential errors and their contextual impli-
cations, in ﬂuencing how air pollution is understood and perceived (Garnett, 2016).
Fourthly, the role of citizens or actors using air quality data is closely intertwined withthe conceptualizations of data and its potential within various settings, shaping de ﬁnitions
of‘good ’citizenship and enacting di ﬀerent forms of citizenship (Gabrys, 2022; Gross et al.,
2019). This line of research focuses on phronetic meanings, connecting the values and
judgments of actors to their practices, and encompassing the de ﬁnition of citizenship
and active involvement in the process of air data ﬁcation to generate care for air quality.
Prior research has given limited attention to air quality data as a matter of care,
encompassing practical considerations and the de ﬁnition of ‘good ’practices. There is a
need for a comprehensive conceptualization of caring that acknowledges the interdepen-dence of these two aspects: a de ﬁnition of caring for the state of air quality through data,
while also situating it in a relational context. The data phronesis concept reinvigoratesawareness of power dynamics within the realm of data care. This is crucial becausedata is often perceived in terms of its objectivity and purity, while focusing on phronesissheds light on how power inﬂ uences data production, evaluation, and use.
1This perspec-
tive helps us grasp the vulnerability of sociotechnical systems in air data ﬁcation, and
facilitates a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted roles data plays in air pollutiondata politics. In the following sections of the article, I will demonstrate how we can con-
ceptualize the duality of care for the air –as practice and phronesis –in the material, rela-
tional, and contextual realm of air quality data politics, referring to the speciﬁ c landscape
of anti-smog politics in Poland.
Polish air quality data politics
Poland’ s high pollution levels, ranking among the highest in the European Union,
present a critical environmental concern due to the negative impact on human health(Matczak et al., 2023 ; Wróblewski et al., 2021 ). Winter seasons in Poland see heightened
pollution levels from heating activities, leading to increased public discourse and around
50% of the population recognizing smog as an urgent issue (Frankowski, 2020 ). Heigh-
tened public awareness of air pollution has spurred the involvement of various actorswho are actively engaged and care about the air dataﬁ cation process, turning it into a
dynamic arena where diverse actors participate ( Ślosarski, 2023 ), including public insti-
tutions, anti-smog activists, scientists, as well as commercial actors (Matczak et al., 2023 ).762 B.ŚLOSARSKI
Data usage is a central issue, as the various actors use data from diverse sources –public
infrastructure and low-cost sensor networks –in their strategic actions.
Within this context, the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection (GIO Ś)i s
the key actor. Since 1991, this government agency has maintained its role as the provider
of the most dependable smog data, operating nearly 300 public measurement stationsthat constitute the foundation of its monitoring network, using this data to inform
both domestic and EU government entities. However, since 2012, due to the increasing
social e ﬀorts to combat smog, GIOŚ has encountered an unforeseen challenger in the
anti-smog movement, which measures and reports air pollution within local commu-nities using public and lower-cost sensors, despite their higher measurement inaccura-
cies. The upsurge in interest and active engagement in the air data ﬁcation process in
Poland has not only impacted researchers who previously faced challenges in sharing
theirﬁndings with the public, but has also catalyzed the growth of a market for commer-
cial entities establishing private measurement sensors and selling air puriﬁ ers as priva-
tized solutions to the public issue of air pollution. Air data ﬁcation in Poland is,
therefore, a realm where a variety of actors pursue their distinct objectives through
data use. This involves engaging in mutual interactions that manifest as practical invol-
vement in data practices and making value judgments concerning data, infrastructure,and other actors, essentially encapsulating the essence of data phronesis. In this context,GIOŚ as the incumbent entity collects data for institutional reporting and collaborates
with scientists. Meanwhile, local activists, as part of the anti-smog movement, engagein data action using public and low-cost sensors, often seeking guidance from knowl-edgeable scientists. Together with market players and civic-tech entities, the anti-smog
movement challenges the status quo by raising public awareness, providing content
for journalists, and inﬂ uencing local and state institutions.
For the study on air quality data politics, I conducted 20 in-depth, semi-structured
interviews involving a diverse group of 12 activists from di ﬀerent locations. The inter-
views aimed to explore the various data practices and meanings within the movement(Blee & Taylor, 2002 ). Based on insights shared by the activists, an additional eight
key actors were identi ﬁed, including public institutions, air pollution scientists, civic
technology actors, and data journalists. The interviews employed a deliberative and phro-netic approach (Flyvbjerg, 2013 ) in which I unpacked the process of dataﬁcation of air
with interview participants, noting how individual actors value these processes, taking
into account other actors, the relationships between them, and how they value the prac-
tices of using data in their strategic actions. The aim of the interviews was to collabora-tively establish the practical meanings and importance ascribed to actors, practices, and
various types of data. This was not about distinguishing them in terms of ontology (e.g.,
human vs. non-human actors), but rather in the context-speci ﬁc ethical considerations ofTable 1. Phronesis and practices of data-mediated care in relational and contextual dimensions.

what is deemed right or wrong in the case of active involvement understood as caring
about air quality. The analysis of the empirical material using Atlas. Ti software followed
the principles of re ﬂexive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2022 ), with the aim of gen-
erating patterned meanings across the dataset and exploring the socially perceived prac-tices, actors, relationships, and phronetic meanings associated with them.
In this research, conducted as part of a larger project, the focus was on how data legit-
imizes the actions of environmental activists. During the study, the concept of careemerged incidentally through interactions with activists, shifting the perception of
data from being a universal resource for activism to recognizing its role within socio-
technical networks of care. This involves acknowledging shared vulnerability acrossdiverse relational contexts. As a result, data itself can be conceptualized as an object of
care. Consequently, I generated four themes on the intertwining of data practices and
phronesis in air quality politics, as presented in Table 1 .
The themes address the duality of care as phronesis and data practices, while high-
lighting the signi ﬁcance of relationality and contextuality in these practices and practical
valuations of data. The detailed explanations for each of the four themes aim to show howphronetic meanings inﬂ uence the understanding of environmental care in relation to
data practices and the perception of more-than-human worlds. It is important to note
that the themes are analytically divided to represent the four elements that constitute
dataﬁed care in air quality policy.
Caring about data
Theﬁrst theme –‘caring about data’–encompasses both phronetic and relational
aspects, focusing on the de ﬁnitions of ‘good ’data practices and standards within the
realm of air quality data. The attitude towards data, rooted in practical judgments, serves
as the primary di ﬀerentiating factor among actors involved in the politics of air quality
data. Caring about data involves developing a vision of the standards applicable in this
domain and evaluating various data sets and types based on these standards. In other
words, this theme addresses the issue of ‘good care ’as appropriate air dataﬁcation, result-
ing from a situated negotiation between actors engaged in air quality data politics (Mol
et al., 2010 ).
Caring about data is primarily inﬂ uenced by air quality scientists, who shape the con-
cept of ‘good data’ based on their expertise in data acquisition and use. They emphasize
the importance of producing data that adheres to technoscienti ﬁc standards and employs
professional equipment and reference methods. These standards are established by scien-
tists and public institutions. A crucial factor in this determination is the value attributed
to diﬀerentiated air pollution sensors. In Poland, both public measurement stations and
low-cost, commercial, or citizen-made sensors are available. However, as one scientist
pointed out, low-cost sensors were originally designed for measuring pollution in work-
place settings, focusing on larger pollution peaks than those typically found in Polish cities
(Sci-Smog-1). As a result, public measurement stations are considered the most reliable
source of quality data, providing information on average pollution exposure rather than
temporary spikes. This high standard is reinforced by legal regulations, as emphasized byan environmental lawyer who states that data from the Chief Inspectorate of Environ-mental Protection is the only reliable data admissible in lawsuits (Law-Smog). Ultimately,764 B.ŚLOSARSKI
the de ﬁnition of ‘good data’ encompasses both the phronetic aspect of responsibly hand-
ling data according to scienti ﬁc and legal standards, and the relationships with various
actors, including the public institutions responsible for maintaining measurement infra-
structure, and the involvement of experts and scientists in the measurement process.
The practical signi ﬁcance of ‘bad data’ in this context is minimal, but it primarily
serves as a reference point for the interviewees. It refers to the misuse of data obtainedfrom unreliable sensors, which raises questions about its quality. As one scientist ironi-cally remarked, these devices often lack clarity regarding what they measure: but it shows
on some screens some concentration. It measures every second, right? All it takes is for sometruck with a broken engine to pass and it will emit a pile of this dust into the air. Theinstantaneous concentration will be dramatic, for example, eight hundred. The norm is
forty. God, twenty times the permissible concentration! (Sci-Smog-2). This observation
aimed to emphasize the lowest standard of data, which was universally acknowledged
by all study participants. Among the interviewees, which included both scienti ﬁc and
lay actors, there was consistent mention of the technological fetishism exhibited by cer-tain users, showcasing the lowest standard that manifests through an inability to properlyassess the value and composition of technological tools and the data they generate.
Existing value judgments regarding good and bad data shape the landscape within
which local activists operate. They use public data if it is available in their area, butalso rely on ‘just good enough data’ (Gabrys et al., 2016 ) from low-cost sensors to com-
municate daily air pollution levels not captured by o ﬃcial measurements. Their practical
judgment of data revolves around the speci ﬁc requirements of their strategic actions
aimed at addressing air quality concerns within their communities. It is important tonote that activists are not unaware of the standards set for ‘good ’data. On the contrary,
they actively engage with and assign signi ﬁcance to these standards, based on their rela-
tional practices. For example, when engaging in o ﬃcial communication, they use publicly
accessible data that they obtain and analyze independently. As described by a female acti-vist from the conservative context of a small town in southern Poland, their access to data
provides a basis for their claims and enhances the credibility of their e ﬀorts: when local
authorities ﬁnally put up the measurement station, we also had something to base our
claims on. If a blonde comes to the city hall and says, ‘because the air stinks, do something
about it,’ well, we weren ’t taken seriously at all. And now, when we have data, we can
somehow base our actions on that (Act-Smog-3). Activists use low-cost sensors to provide
real-time updates on local air conditions via social media platforms. While this approachallows for quick information sharing to indicate whether air quality is good or bad, the
results are not precise (Act-Smog-11). In this manner, activists employ various types of
data as a strategic toolbox to address diverse needs.
All actors, particularly activists, align themselves with the ‘good ’data concept,
acknowledging its empowering in ﬂuence on strategic action. It enables them to shift
from neglected matters of concern to undeniable matters of fact. The ‘bad data’ ﬁgure
helps draw a line between actors who can participate in air quality data politics andthose who choose technological fetishism as a counterweight to the matter of concern.
Nevertheless, real adaptation relies on addressing the initial concerns through tinkering,which involves recognizing the shared fragility of the socio-technical assemblage sup-
porting it. In this sense, it boils down to practical and goal-oriented caring for data
(Schrader, 2015 , p. 668).INFORMATION, COMM UNICATION & SOCIETY 765
Caring for data
The second theme –‘caring for data’– speciﬁcally concerns socio-technical data practices
focused on practical tinkering with various measurement tools. On one hand, this rep-
resents a practical and tangible manifestation of ‘good practices. ’On the other, it fosters
various more-than-human relationships.
Practical tinkering uncovers a whole network of human and non-human actors
who care about air quality data. As highlighted earlier, the primary source of infor-mation is the state’ s Air Quality Monitoring, with nearly 300 stations spread across
the country, which not only meets several methodological standards, but also ensuresthat these stations are regularly serviced, looked after, and maintained in such a way
that these devices operate under the conditions that the manufacturer imposes (Sci-
Smog-2). However, there are also numerous networks of low-cost sensors that are
used by local activists to monitor air pollution. The primary distinction between
these low-cost sensors and traditional monitoring stations lies in the method forextracting data from polluted air. As a local activist explained, low-cost sensors
shine a laser and detect dust particles in the air stream ( …) The di ﬀerence between
the oﬃ cial station and the amateur sensor is that the o ﬃcial station prepares this
air properly, it simply dries it. And only such dried air is subjected to measurements.Amateur sensors are not able to do that (Act-Smog-6). In this sense, the existing data
standards are materially rooted in entire networks of measurement infrastructure
maintained by the state or commercial-citizen e ﬀorts. Yet these methods of caring
for data quality are not all treated as equal, and the ‘good practice ’of data handling
inﬂuences the speci ﬁc practices undertaken by actors –especially the grassroots
actors, who are not representatives of the dominant state-corporate-academiadataﬁcation trio (Treré, 2019 ).
The main sociotechnical practice of data care is calibration, by coordinating
cheaper sensors with public measurement stations, in order to respond to the valuejudgments of other actors and reinforce the importance of the data and the claims
behind it. Although the intentionality of this process is on the human side, the
implementation is dependent on a network of non-human actors. Firstly, calibrationcomes down to the sensor calibrating itself with the oﬃ cial stations and just putting in
some corrective algorithms, based on the current humidity, to make those measurementsmore reliable (Act-Smog-6). Secondly, the algorithmic calibration is still subject to
measurement error, hence the anti-smog movement in Poland is also taking a morematerialistic approach, by developing its own measuring station –certiﬁed by the
Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection –at two locations in southern Poland.
The activist in charge of the maintenance describes what the measurement processlooks like at these stations: Dust is collected and measured through an online measurement
system and sent to a laboratory where it is weighed again to con ﬁrm the measurements.
This process serves as a validation in case any disturbances or issues occur with the spectraldevice or laser spectroscopy device during the initial measurements. The dust collected on
the tapes is carefully checked and weighed in the laboratory, and speciﬁ c thresholds are
used to con ﬁrm the accuracy of the results (Act-Smog-12). Air pollution measurement
essentially involves the de facto weighing of dust (Choy, 2011 ), which undergoes
multiple levels of veri ﬁcation, both technical and in laboratory settings. In this context,766 B.ŚLOSARSKI
practical caring for data refers to the notion of seeing-touching (de la Bellacasa, 2017 ,
pp. 113 –114), understood as the process of translating air samples into tangible dust
and subsequently transforming them into data.
In terms of sociotechnical practices, the measurement stations are used to calibrate
mobile dust meters to measure locations not covered by state monitoring –which is
done by placing them next to the measuring station and manually correcting the results,
adjusting them for reliable measurements. A dust meter calibrated in this way creates themost reliable measurement data, approaching the ‘good data’ standard. Calibration is a
form of practical socio-technical adaptation to the data standard; it is a practical exampleof maneuvering and tinkering between the standards of technologically diverse devicesand data quality, but at the same time it relies on diverse non-human actors, such as
measurement stations, dust meters, low-cost sensors and the measurement networks
that coexist with them.
Caring by data
Phronetic valuing of data in relation to speci ﬁc socio-technical practices is not realized
only in terms of the relational dimension, but also in terms of the perceived and
deﬁned context of maintained action. The third theme –‘caring by data’– speciﬁcally
addresses these issues, focusing on the de ﬁnitions of ‘good ’use and the ‘appropriate ’
scope of data use within perceived contexts. A notable aspect of this theme is the tensionbetween the local and global contexts.
In the local context, the strategic placement of public and commercial/citizen sensors
plays a crucial role. The local context is highly important in data usage, but disagreementsoften arise regarding the role of data within speci ﬁc contexts. Public actors prioritize
localization by establishing measurement stations at the local level, considering spatial
resolution, and aiming for accurate and comprehensive data collection for air quality
management at the administrative level. The selection of station locations adheres tomethodological criteria and reporting obligations stipulated by European Union law,
and requires negotiations with landowners to secure a certain level of inviolability ( …)
that ensures that stations are not arbitrarily relocated (Public-Smog). The primary admin-
istrative objective is to ensure continuity, scienti ﬁc reliability, and compatibility with air
quality reporting systems at both national and EU levels. On the other hand, local acti-vists employ a proximity strategy, by focusing on speci ﬁc locations to highlight the
environmental situation and advocate for change. The proximity and locality of data
hold signi ﬁcant importance for the community, as individuals tend to concentrate on
tracking immediate surroundings, such as nearby streets and neighborhoods. However,these two values often clash, since public measurement stations predominantly provideaveraged and longitudinal pollution data, whereas activists and the local community –
mostly vulnerable people such as children and elders –need real-time data speci ﬁct o
their immediate location.
However, this does not mean that activists are locally entrenched, and public insti-
tutions are oriented toward reporting the results of the European Union. All actors par-ticipate in a kind of ecology of comparison (Choy, 2011 ), viewing localities in relation to
the global context and constructing scales of comparison between these contexts. As oneactivist summarized this contingent comparative approach by stating, Poland is also theINFORMATION, COMM UNICATION & SOCIETY 767
most polluted country in the entire European Union, both in terms of PM10, PM2.5, and
benzopyrene. As for benzopyrene, the standard is one nanogram per cubic meter, and the
average for Poland is about ﬁve nanograms per cubic meter. These are the concentrations,
the annual average for the whole country, but there are localities such as mine, which is therecord holder in this area, where the annual concentration of benzopyrene is eighteen nano-
grams per cubic meter (Act-Smog 11). Thus, the immediate neighborhood is constantly
compared with the entire country and the European Union, in ﬂuencing the ways in
which locality is valued. This comparison serves to highlight disparities in public policyactions across di ﬀerent localities, underscoring the issue of unjust metrics when com-
pared to other EU regions.
‘Caring by data’ is achieved through two contextual dimensions. Firstly, by the local-
ization of metrics based on guiding values in administrative and community-tracking
practices that may sometimes contradict each other. Secondly, they both relate to the glo-bal context, often associated with the European Union and western countries. This
association allows for the creation of comparative scales that provide alternative perspec-
tives on localities where these practices are implemented. Phronetic meaning is context-dependent, although actors in their valuing move within constructed scales, which alsotake on material and practical dimensions.
Data for caring
The fourth theme –‘data for caring’–directly addresses the material and practical issues
of contextuality, understood as practical uses of data combining various local and global
contexts of action. Certainly, it should be emphasized that data is used in many ways,
coinciding with the repertoires of action of environmental data activists or the strategiesof public institutions and market actors (Gutierrez, 2018 ; Negi & Srigyan, 2021 ; Sun &
Huang, 2021 ). In the studied context, data is used for caring about individual and collec-
tive health through visual representations of air pollution shared on social media plat-forms or via traditional means such as informational materials displayed in
kindergartens or schools. Additionally, data plays a role in engaging with policymakers.
This theme also sheds light on grassroots observation and activist pressure on local andnational institutions of power, as well as the use of data in implementing comparisonecology to construct comparative scales between speciﬁ c locations. Therefore, the
focus will primarily be on the activist practice of ranking the most polluted locationsin Poland.
The practice of ranking is both a comparison and an elaborate way of informing com-
munities and local institutions about how their locations relate to others across thecountry and norms established by the EU. As one of the activists described, the processboils down to combining available datasets and translating the data into speciﬁc rankings:
When we have these annual rankings of the smog record holders, we prepare a map on
which we plot these localities, and we show in a very simple, graphic way where these con-centrations are high. We can make some kind of graph that shows us a comparison of the
norm to what the annual concentration was. Because if we say that in one location there
were eighteen nanograms per cubic meter of benzoalphapyrene concentrations on anannual average, that doesn ’t tell a normal person much at all. But if we compare it to
this [EU] norm, which is one nanogram, and show these bars one and eighteen, then768 B.ŚLOSARSKI
some ordinary citizens can accept that we have a problem. Because it ’s not just a matter of
eighteen nanograms there …It’s an overrun of eighteen times! That says more than just
the value (Act-Smog-10).
Value judgments identi ﬁed with the ecology of comparison gain practical materi-
alization in the form of ranking. This quote encapsulates two crucial practices of data
use. One is to provide reports on the air quality status, while the other involves
translating intricate information using rankings as tools for comparing and blendinglocal contexts. These practices also involve transitioning between the EU norms of
pollution imposed by the administrative logic of measurement and the logic of
addressing social needs, demonstrating the practical implementation of the ecologyof comparison. Furthermore, this quote alludes to the presence of two logics –
administrative and social –in deﬁning good practices, which are central to the poli-
tics surrounding air quality data in Poland. However, the most crucial practice lies inthe ability to e ﬀectively translate data outputs. This involves maintaining standards
on one hand, while also adapting to the communication requirements of socialmedia platforms and the limited attention span of the public on the other. ‘Data
for caring’ is contextualized and, at the same time, enables the merging and amalga-
mation of diverse contexts in relation to other localities and transnational air quality
standards.
Discussion
In Polish air quality data politics, several actors have emerged who actively engage in
the process of air data ﬁcation, overseeing the measurement networks responsible for
generating air quality data and visualizing smog in the public sphere. This data is not
merely seen as a tool for strategic interact ions, but also as something that requires
active involvement and caring. Those ac tively involved in the process view the
data as vulnerable and fragile, necessitating constant maintenance work of sociotech-
nical assemblages (de la Bellacasa, 2017). Thus, data signi ﬁcantly impacts our breath-
able environments, giving rise to new sensibilities within the context (Lindén &Lydahl, 2021). However, its value is not uniform among the various actors involved
in the air data ﬁcation process, as it depends on the practical adaptations and value
judgments of these actors. In this sense, the data ﬁcation of air is understood as a
matter of care with a fundamentally dual nature, straddling the line betweenpractical tinkering with data and measur ement technologies, and the situated
deﬁnition of what constitutes good or just -good-enough care in the form of high-
quality data.
This duality of care highlights the interconnectedness between data phronesis and
practice within the studied context. Data phronesis, which serves as situated and
context-dependent practical wisdom for various actors and their value judgments
(Flyvbjerg, 2013 ), inﬂ uences what is deemed good or bad in the data ﬁcation process.
This primarily pertains to the de ﬁnition of data meeting a good or satisfactory standard
in comparison with other actors, as well as in ﬂuencing which contextual scopes and
areas of data use are appropriate. Data phronesis allows us to capture how actorsdeﬁne and perceive the vulnerability of data, while at the same time paying attention
to the dependencies involved in power relations –as shown by the example of activistsINFORMATION, COMM UNICATION & SOCIETY 769
adapting to the value judgments of scientists. Within this context, data phronesis is
realized through the ongoing negotiation of the de ﬁnition of data-mediated care for
air quality. This negotiation is evident in the dominant position held by scientists
and public institutions on one hand, and the orientation towards a high standard bylocal activists on the other. The negotiation encompasses not only data quality, but
also a form of comparative ecology that addresses the connections between locality
and global benchmarks (Choy, 2011 ), whether referring to the entire country, Europe,
or other locations worldwide. In this context, data phronesis addresses the notion of
‘good care ’for the dataﬁcation of air, arising from a situated negotiation among actors
involved in air quality data politics, where the phronetic meaning is also context-
dependent, and actor valuations operate within constructed scales that also encompass
the material and practical dimension.
This practical dimension is realized by data, understood as practical tinkering with
data and measurement technologies. Within the Polish context, data production con-cerns the materialization of air, which is achieved through the conversion of air pollution
into vials of dust. These vials, in turn, can be transformed into indices or rankings, thusbecoming circulating references or manifestations of matter that enable the mobility ofmaterial forms (Choy, 2011 , p. 163). The rankings produced by activists represent
numerical representations with profound implications for their a ﬀective and aesthetic
eﬀects, shaping the a ﬀectionate understanding (de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 62) of our pol-
luted and/or breathable worlds (Liu, 2017 , p. 448). Data practices represent a practical
adaptation to the value judgments of actors dominating the sphere of air quality datapolitics, including public institutions and researchers. This adaptation is achieved by cali-brating and aligning sensors with public measurement stations. Practical adaptation also
applies to the production of air pollution rankings, wherein there is a materially
grounded negotiation and blending of contexts to complement the public narrative onone hand, and reinforce it on the other, by incorporating local dimensions of airpollution.
Considered together, data phronesis and data practice represent two highly inter-
related dimensions of care for air dataﬁ cation in Poland, shaped by unequal relation-
ships and inﬂ uenced by individual actors ’value judgments. These actors implement
dataﬁcation practices and adhere to values that shape the de ﬁnition of ‘good ’practices
and the appropriate scope of data usage. These determinations in ﬂuence the inclusion
and exclusion of other actors and expose visible power dynamics and inequality, par-
ticularly concerning technoscience and factors like origin and gender. Phronesis thus
unveils interdependencies and exclusions within speciﬁc contexts while propellingthese de ﬁnitions of ‘good ’data and practices within dynamic and relational situations.
By exploring phronesis, we uncover the diverse value judgments held by actors in theirpractices and relationships. It also reveals the contextual sensibilities of individualactors who actively respond to values and demands. However, phronesis is not analyti-cally dominant, but rather shaped by practical adaptation. Nevertheless, its role involves
situated theorizing, undertaken by all actors involved in taking care of things, and
remaining responsible for their becomings (de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). By examining both
phronesis and practices, we gain insights into the realities of power dynamics, exclu-
sions, and cooperative interdependencies within the networks that sustain the data ﬁca-
tion of air.770 B.ŚLOSARSKI
Conclusion
In this article, the duality of care is emphasized, focusing on the interplay between data
phronesis –context-dependent practical wisdom determining the practical tinkering
with data/technology –and data practices. The article also highlights the ongoing nego-
tiation surrounding air quality concerns, mediated through data, within relational andcontextual dimensions.
Four key themes related to data-mediated air quality care are identi ﬁed: ‘caring about
data ’involves valuing and assessing practices based on phronetic and relational values
despite tensions between activists and scienti ﬁc-administrative approaches. ‘Caring for
data ’entails translating polluted air into reliable data while considering dominant stan-
dards and inﬂ uential judgments. ‘Caring by data’ deﬁnes data usage methods and scopes
within dynamic local and global contexts. ‘Data for caring’ explores practical appli-
cations, speci ﬁcally examining activist practices in integrating diverse local contexts
with European air quality standards. These themes underscore the complex interplaybetween human and non-human actors, the signi ﬁcance of phronetic meanings, and
the practical application of data within distinct relational and contextual frameworks
in air quality data politics.
The concept of data phronesis revitalizes our understanding of power dynamics in the
context of data handling. The phronetic approach o ﬀers several advantages aligned with
the ‘matters of care’ perspective. Firstly, it positions the practical judgment of diverse
actors actively involved in socio-technical caring practices, recognizing their signi ﬁcance
in more-than-human world composition (de la Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 35; Flyvbjerg, 2013 ,
p. 133). Secondly, it acknowledges that the theoretical sensibilities of various actors are
not neutral, fostering a dialogue concerning what constitutes good care within a speci ﬁc
context (Flyvbjerg, 2013 , p. 61; Mol et al., 2010 ). Thirdly, it demonstrates re ﬂexivity to the
strategy within relational power dynamics, acknowledging that de ﬁnitions of care are
diverse and coexist in contradiction (Flyvbjerg, 2013 , p. 139; Lindén & Lydahl, 2021 ).
By emphasizing phronesis, we gain insight into how power shapes the production, assess-ment, and use of data. This perspective enables us to comprehend the susceptibility of
sociotechnical systems in the realm of air data ﬁcation and promotes a nuanced recog-
nition of the diverse roles that data plays in the politics of air pollution data.
