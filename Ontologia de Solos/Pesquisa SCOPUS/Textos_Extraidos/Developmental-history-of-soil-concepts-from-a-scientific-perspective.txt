Featured Application: New concepts within the soil science community have emerged through
multiple actions: (1) reﬂection on the social, cultural, and/or political needs that exist outside the
soil science community, and (2) by being progressive and relevant to new emergent interests (e.g.,
health and security). Future applications of research communication are expanding from tradi-
tional formats (e.g., papers, books, printed journals) to digital research platforms that enhance
the capacity of growth in soil science research.
Abstract: Various soil concepts have emerged since the beginning of the twentieth century, with
some shared similarities. These concepts have contributed to a rise in the awareness of protecting
limited soil resources, but not every idea has equally gained widespread attention from scientists. The
purpose of this study was to document the developmental history of 10 soil concepts from 1900 to 2018
and investigate their growth/decline. Articles containing words related to the selected soil concepts
in titles, abstracts, or publication contents available in the Web of Science were examined. “Soil
production” was the oldest concept, found in a paper published in 1910, followed chronologically in
the literature by soil care, fertility, conservation, quality, health, protection, security, sustainability,
and resilience. Most of the concepts were initially found in non-soil-science journals that predated
publications in soil science journals, which implies slowness of the soil science community’s adoption.
The statistical publication trend for each concept over time was analyzed and interpreted based
on diffusion of innovation theory. The results suggest that all of the soil concepts experienced a
statistically positive/upward shift ( p< 0.01) over time. In particular, soil concepts cited in soil science
journals tended to maintain their momentum and communal value over time in soil science research,
except the soil care concept. Applications of soil concept research based on collaboration between
scientists of different nationalities, afﬁliations, and research expertise would further increase the
possibility of citation frequency and foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration.
Keywords: soil health; soil quality; soil security; soil conservation; soil fertility; soil sustainability;
soil productivity; soil care; soil protection; soil resilience
1. Introduction
Various soil concepts have been discussed over time in the soil science community,
and narrative descriptions of these concepts have been developed to capture the increasing
complexity of soil–environmental issues. Many of these have helped to raise awareness
of the need to protect limited soil resources [ 1], but some are used inconsistently or in-
terchangeably due to the shared semantics of their deﬁnitions, aims, and/or scopes [ 2].
Soil quality and soil health are examples of concepts that improve public awareness of the
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275. https://doi.org/10.3390/app11094275 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 2 of 19
importance of soil resources, with short- and long-term soil management that inﬂuence
soil functions and processes in practice [3,4].
Soil concepts seem to arise from a combination of various pathways: researchers in
the scientiﬁc community (top-down); dialogue in professional organizations (top-down
and bottom-up); and communication with stakeholders (bottom-up). Mizuta et al. (2018)
summarized diverse deﬁnitions of soil concepts, including soil quality, soil health, and soil
security [ 2]. These deﬁnitions were proposed by scientists and professional organizations,
such as the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA). Semantic similarities can be found
among the deﬁnitions of each soil concept. Soil quality and soil health are used loosely and
interchangeably with another soil concept, soil fertility [ 5]. Stevens explained soil health
as a holistic measure of soil productivity, resilience, and sustainability [ 6]. Soil care has
been promoted, along with soil productivity and fertility, in the service of farmers [ 7]. Soil
care can be seen as a broad concept encompassing soil fertility, soil conservations, and/or
protection from soil degradation [8].
Professional institutions seem to play the role of aggregating individual proposed
ideas into an adaptable form for various stakeholders. On the other hand, Sojka et al.
(2003) sounded an alert in regard to the impacts of institutionalizing deﬁnitions of soil
concepts that may prevent speciﬁc stakeholders from protecting/managing soil resources
properly [ 9]. The gap between individual and collective perceptions/perspectives must be
revealed and closed. For instance, Grunwald et al. (2017) addressed this need using the
Meta Soil Model, which is rooted in integral theory and integral ecology [ 10]. Bouma (2011)
asserted that the different opinions of various stakeholders (farmers, non-governmental
organizers, manufacturers, researchers, etc.) and policymakers must be aligned to enable
successful projects based on a review of sustainability problems in Dutch agriculture [ 11].
Ng and Zhang (2019) stated that top-down policy-driven changes in soil health manage-
ment will be necessary for the common good [ 5]. However, the bottom-up approach is
underappreciated in current soil concepts.
Understanding how soil concepts have evolved in the soil science community is
crucial for soil scientists, because the concepts’ backgrounds may reﬂect social, cultural,
and/or political needs and events/situations. In addition, quantitative trend analysis
of soil concepts over time can reveal how each concept has gained attention and been
popularized through scientiﬁc research.
Thus, the purpose of this study is to quantitatively understand the developmental
history of various soil concepts (1900 to 2018) and demonstrate changes in their frequency
of use over time. Identifying the origins of each soil concept in publications for the ﬁrst
time may provide insights into how the soil science community adopts new ideas in
scientiﬁc research.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Searching Soil Concept Publications in the Web of Science
Ten major soil concepts were selected for investigation: soil productivity, care, fertility,
conservation, protection, sustainability, resilience, quality, health, and security (Table 1).
The number of publications that contain each concept available in the Web of Science was
analyzed. Materials published from 1900 to 2018 were retrieved on 29 July 2019. The “all
languages” setting was used in the retrieval process, with 52 different languages available
on the website. Search keys for the analysis were imputed with the wildcard character,
asterisk (*), as right-hand truncation and quotation marks (Table 1). Though the wildcard
works for searched items in English only and turns off the automatic lemmatization function
and internal synonym ﬁnder, this process identiﬁed exact phrases and variant spellings
of a word. The following document types were selected for the search: article, editorial
material, book, book chapter, letter, note, proceedings paper, and review. Each category is
described in the Web of Science Core Collection Help section (accessed on 30 July 2019 :
http://images.webofknowledge.com). The text areas searched for the selected soil concepts
in the published materials were limited to titles, abstracts, and key words. This process
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 3 of 19
was expected to minimize the risk of retrieving records that used a given soil concept term
in contexts that differed from its conceptual deﬁnition.
Table 1. Search keys for each soil concept (in English).
Soil Concepts Search Keys
Soil Care “Soil care*”
Soil Conservation “Soil conservat*”
Soil Fertility “Soil fertilit*”
Soil Health “Soil health*”
Soil Productivity “Soil productiv*”
Soil Protection “Soil protect*”
Soil Quality “Soil qualit*”
Soil Resilience “Soil resilien*”
Soil Security “Soil securit*”
Soil Sustainability “Soil sustainabilit*”
Note that the asterisk (*) is the wildcard that represents any group of characters, including no character.
Two groups, soil science journals and “all” (i.e., both soil science and non-soil science)
journals, were searched to identify pioneering contributions from scientists across the
research ﬁelds. A total of 35 soil science journals exclusively within the soil science category
were examined to analyze the number of publications containing each soil concept. Of the
35 soil science journals, the earliest publication was the Soil Science (SS) journal in 1916,
and the most recent was Geoderma Regional in 2016. Journals without an impact factor
were considered in identifying pioneer contributors for each concept but not in the trend
analyses. The annual impact factor (IF) for year 2018 is automatically generated on the
website with the equation:
IF=X/Y (1)
where Xis the number of 2018 citations and Yis the number of source publications pub-
lished during the previous two years (2016–2017). The IF measures citations of published
articles divided by the number of recent articles and represents the signiﬁcance of cita-
tion frequency by eliminating biases such as the size of the journal, issue frequency, and
citable body size of the literature [ 12]. The calculation of eigenfactor scores (ES), on the
other hand, is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the
past ﬁve years are cited and excludes self-citations from the calculation. The metrics are
calculated using network analysis to determine the mathematical weights and apply them
to each citation depending on the citation inﬂuence of the source publication [ 12]. Total
numbers of publications for soil concepts in soil science journals and all journals were
calculated to understand the contribution from the soil science community for each soil
concept. The earliest publications with soil concepts were also retrieved from the Web of
Science database.
2.2. Statistical Methods for Change Point Detection and Trend Analysis of Publications
A single change point, at which the number of publications for each soil concept
signiﬁcantly increases/decreases during the search period (1900–2018), was identiﬁed
using a nonparametric method, Pettitt’s test [ 13]. This point represents abrupt changes in
the data when a property of the time series shifts. In other words, statistical distributions
would likely differ for past and future data at that point. This analysis does not assume that
Yivalues (number of publications over time in our case) are normally distributed, because
the algorithm is based on the ranks of the elements of a series rather than on the values
themselves [ 14]. Thus, it is less sensitive to outliers. The analysis was conducted using the
“trend” package in R (3.5.3) [15].
A nonparametric trend analysis, the Mann–Kendall test, was also performed to assess
whether there is a statistical upward/downward trend in the number of publications
separately for each soil concept over time. This rank-based analysis does not assume
that the Yivalues conform to any unique distributions [ 16]. The algorithm computes the
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 4 of 19
difference between the later-measured value and all earlier-measured values to identify
positive/negative differences or no differences [ 17]. Hirsch et al. (1982) described this
method as appropriate for quantifying the large magnitude of changes over time [ 18]. The
analysis was conducted using the “Kendall” package in R [19].
3. Results
A total of 35 journals were grouped in the soil science category in the Web of Science
(Table 2). The youngest journal with over 10,000 total citations was Catena , which began
publishing in 1983. No journals published within the past decade have yet reached 2000
citations. A few journals published before 2015 have not reached more than 1000 citations,
such as Agrochimica ,Arid Land Research and Management , and Soil and Water Research .

1Total number of times each journal has been cited by all journals included in the database from the time when the journal began publishing.
The following journals were ranked as having the ﬁve highest IF and ES scores: Soil
Biology & Biochemistry (SBB); Biology and Fertility of Soils (BFS); Soil & Tillage Research (STR);
Geoderma; and Land Degradation & Development (LDD). Both the Vadose Zone Journal (VZJ)
and Pedosphere (PDP), which began publishing within the past decade, ranked in the top 10
in terms of IF but not for ES. On the other hand, the Journal of Soils and Sediments (JSS) and
theSoil Science Society of America Journal (SSSAJ) ranked within the top 10 for ES.
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 5 of 19
In some cases, journals were ranked higher for IF and/or ES with fewer total citations.
For example, Clays and Clay Minerals (CCM) from 1968 and LDD from 1996 were similar in
terms of total citations, but the IF of CCM was nearly two times higher than that of LDD.
Even journals with fewer total citations, such as PDP , received higher IF and ES scores than
CCM. Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis (CSSPA), which received a similar
number of total citations as CMM, had a higher ES score but only half the IF score of CMM.
The ES score of the JSS was notably high, considering that its total citations were similar to
those for CCM.
3.1. Scientiﬁc Attention to Soil Concepts in All-Category Journals and Soil Science Journals
The number of publications from all-category journals (i.e., both soil and non-soil
science, labelled “all journals” hereafter) and soil science journals was derived for each soil
concept (Table 3). Soil fertility and soil quality received great attention in both all journals
and soil science journals, followed by soil conservation and soil health. Soil productivity
and soil resilience concepts appeared in soil science journals relatively more often than the
other concepts, at more than 36%. The rates of publications found in soil science journals
out of those in all journals ranged from 25% to 54%, with most rates under 40%.

3.2. Early Studies of Soil Concepts
The earliest soil concept publications were identiﬁed in all journals and soil science
journals available in the Web of Science. In all journals, soil fertility was the earliest
concept published in a journal (1908), followed chronologically in the literature by soil
productivity, conservation, quality, health, protection, care, security, sustainability, and
resilience ( Table 4 ). Soil quality was examined in one article written in German; all the
other materials were written in English. Interestingly, the earliest article on soil health was
found in a medical journal (Table 4). Soil sustainability and soil resilience were the only
concepts that, on the ﬁrst occasion, were published in soil science journals.
When the search window was limited to soil science journals, the order of ﬁrst ap-
pearance for some soil concepts was different from the order for all journals (Table 5). The
earliest literature for soil fertility was found in 1917, which was nine years after the article
was published in a non-soil-science journal. Ten authors were identiﬁed for early studies
of soil conservation. The authors (H.H. Bennett, A.L. Patrick, T.S. Buie, R.H. Musser, L.P .
Merrill, A.E. Mccymonds, C. Luker, C., and J.H. Christ) published their article in 1947 in
the same issue of Soil Science Journal (SSJ, volume 64, issue 6). The author who published
the ﬁrst articles about soil resilience in the category ‘all journal’ and soil science journals
was R. Lal [ 20]. The soil quality concept appeared for the ﬁrst time in an article in the Soviet
Soil Science-USSR (SSS-USSR) in 1971.

Several soil science journals published pioneering work for different soil concepts
(Table 5). For example, CSSPA recorded the earliest articles for soil fertility and soil care;
SSJ produced the earliest articles on soil conservation and soil productivity concepts;
and the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation (JSWC) produced the earliest work on soil
sustainability and soil health. These journals appeared before 1974 and can be classiﬁed as
relatively old journals for soil concepts.
3.3. Quantitative Trends in Soil Concepts
Soil concepts were introduced and popularized at different times. Pettitt’s test was
conducted to ﬁnd the change point in the number of publications for soil concepts over
time (Table 6). The test shows that all soil concepts, except for soil care and soil security,
experienced statistically signiﬁcant shifts in the number of citations between 1900 and 2018.

Soil Care 564 0.65 1994 540 0.25 <0.01
Soil Security 678 0.39 2013 680 0.31 <0.01
Results from the Mann–Kendall test showed that all soil concepts had positive tau
values ( p< 0.00), indicating that the trend of citing the soil concepts overall has statistically
increased. Soil care and soil security did not observe a statistically signiﬁcant change point
(p> 0.05). A possible reason could be the low number of publications found in the literature
analysis. We found that soil care did appear in published articles at low frequency, but
more prominently on websites. Soil security was introduced in soil science journals more
recently, which is likely the reason that it had the lowest frequency of citations.
The differences between the year when each soil concept appeared for the ﬁrst time in
all journals (A) and the soil science journals (B) and the change points (C) were calculated
in detail (Table 7). Many soil concepts appeared in soil science journals 20 years or more
after they appeared in non-soil-science journals for the ﬁrst time (B-A in Table 7). Soil
fertility was an exception, with a nine-year difference. Soil resilience and soil sustainability
concepts had a value of zero because they appeared in soil science journals ﬁrst. Many
soil concepts reached their change point almost 40 years or more after appearing in all
journals (C-A in Table 7). However, change points for soil quality, soil health, and soil care
came almost immediately after the soil science journals published articles with those soil
concepts (C-B in Table 7).
The number of publications for each soil concept overall increased over time, particu-
larly since 1990 (Figure 1). Soil concepts differed in the speeds at which their publication
rates increased. Most journals experienced visibly upward trends in publications up to
2018, except for soil care.

4. Discussion
4.1. The Emergence of Soil Concepts
Many soil concepts have emerged at different times over the years. The soil fertility
concept appeared to be the earliest of all of the soil concepts examined in both all journals
(1908) and soil science journals (1917) (Tables 4 and 5). Viets (1977) argued that much
of the research that contributed to progress in soil fertility research was conducted even
before the establishment of a formalized soil science [ 21]. McNeill and Winiwarter (2004)
supported this idea and asserted that the oldest writing on the topic—the book Yugong ,
which described the characteristics of soil fertility in Northern China—appeared in around
500 B.C.E. [22].
The soil fertility concept has a strong association with measurements of soil nutrients
for crop production [ 23]. Patzel (2004) found the historical linkage between human fertility
and soil fertility in the writing— Mother Earth [24,25]. The linkage has been developed
across diverse cultures as farmers developed a general agronomic theory in the late 18th
century [ 26]. Social and technological development and understanding have also impacted
the development of soil concepts. Food supply shortages during and after the World Wars
led questions of soil fertility to be central [ 22] at a time when urgent demand for farm
products and high prices confronted U.S. farmers [ 27]. Many countries in Europe also
recognized the need to increase agricultural production, especially after World War II [ 28].
Justus von Liebig and John Lawes were early scientists in Europe who contributed to the
initial development of organic chemistry for soils and mineral fertilizer production, which
revolutionized agricultural production. A German chemist, Fritz Haber, later synthesized
and industrialized nitrogen fertilizers, which coincided with trends to industrialize and
corporatize agriculture and forest industries (e.g., machinery- and technology-derived
agricultural revolutions). Land reform after World War II, enforced by U.S. occupation
forces, also played an essential role in consolidating fragmented agricultural land in
Japan [ 29]. Other countries in South Asia have increased external inputs to enhance
agricultural production by diversifying biophysical and chemical conditions. Soil fertility
currently emphasizes the biological, chemical, and physical soil attributes important for
provisioning crop nutrients and water [ 30,31]. The measurements and analysis of such soil
properties have been explored as well in context of soil fertility studies, e.g., [32,33].
The concepts of soil conservation and soil productivity appeared in soil science jour-
nals at almost the same time in the late 1940s (Table 4). The ﬁrst author found in the search
process for all journals in the Web of Science was Lipman (1926), who argued that soil
conservation should deal with both plant-food ingredients and the ability of the soil to
attain maximum crop production capability under all environmental conditions [34]. The
change point for the soil conservation concept came about 20 years later with Hopp and
Slater’s (1948) article, published in SS [ 35]. Hornbeck (2012) reported that many U.S. Plains
areas had cumulatively lost more than 75% of their original topsoil due to deep plowing
and drought, which was notably visible by the 1940s [ 36]. Bennett (1974), argued that the
origin of the U.S. national soil conservation program occurred much earlier than the U.S.
Dust Bowl era of the 1930s [ 37]. The author stated that an article he wrote, which was
published by the Department of Agriculture in the 1920s, was the ﬁrst comprehensive
appraisal of the erosion issue in the U.S. Many regional erosion stations were built and
thousands of soil and water measurements were performed to comply with the Buchanan
Amendment to the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for 1930. Bennett argued that the
commitment of scientists to prevent nutrient runoff and soil erosion was undertaken at
the national level using a top-down approach. According to Ice [ 38], the Soil Conservation
Act of 1935, which sought to develop practical methods of managing lands, was the origin
of the best management practices (BMPs) of today. Agricultural BMPs were designed
to address and minimize agricultural non-point-source pollutions by the applications of
excessive fertilizers and pesticides in the U.S. in the 1960s [ 39]. This movement seems
to correspond to the time when R. Carson published the famous book, Silent Spring , in
1962. As public concerns for environmental degradations and pollutions had spread, soil
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 11 of 19
conservation also experienced the change point in 1967 (Table 6). From the mid-1960s
onward, an increasing number of publications about soil conservation reﬂected the gradual
accumulations of public understanding and awareness.
The enhancement of soil quality was regarded as a goal of improving soil fertility and
agricultural productivity through soil conservation [ 40]. The term “soil quality” appeared
in a German soil science journal shortly after articles on soil conservation were published in
a non-soil-science journal (Table 4). Wolff (1939) used the term to explain the effect of land
use changes on soil characteristics and, in particular, from soil proﬁling perspectives [ 41].
The article was published in a German journal that focused on natural sciences [ 42]. The
journal was founded in 1913, and the article was published in Nazi Germany (1933–1941).
The vision was to be self-sufﬁcient in producing food for Germans toward World War II
that demanded soil assessment (Reichs-Bodenschätzung). This approach to soil assessment
could be considered a predecessor to more modern forms of digital soil mapping that
emerged in the 1980s [ 43]. Hans Jenny developed a conceptual model based on the soil-
forming factors that were rooted in Vasily V . Dokuchaev’s work, and the model became a
standard feature of U.S. survey reports in the 1940s and 1950s [44].
The soil quality concept appeared in a soil science journal for the ﬁrst time 32 years
after the term appeared in a non-soil-science journal (Table 7). The article was available
as an English translation after being published in the SSS-USSR by Taychinov (1971) [ 45].
The author used the term to describe the fundamental physicochemical, biological, and
hydrological properties of soils as those attributes relate to productivity for agriculture,
economic beneﬁts, proﬁtability, and production costs. The deﬁnitions/scopes/aims of soil
quality were revisited by various authors [ 2,46–49]. According to Karlen et al. (2001), the
concept of soil quality was introduced in the North American literature after the mid-1980s,
which was immediately after the concept’s change point in the number of publications
over time (Table 7) [ 50]. This may mean that the deﬁnition was initially overlooked or not
used in North America. A review of soil quality by Bünemann et al. (2018) shows that
the broader deﬁnition considered soil productivity for agriculture as well as the quality
of the environment and animal and human health [ 31]. The authors argued that the term
“soil quality” was introduced by Mausel (1971) [ 51]; however, some authors pointed to
others, such as Warkentin and Fletcher (1977) [ 52], as being among the ﬁrst to introduce
the concept [ 47]. In our opinion, the author initially found in the article search, W. Wolff
(1939), introduced the term “soil quality.”
The similarity/difference between soil quality and soil health is arguable [ 31]. In
deﬁning the concept of soil quality, Parr et al. (1992) stated that soil quality indices could
be used to assess the impact of management practices on human and animal health [ 53].
Though the appearance of soil health in all journals and soil science journals, as well as
the change point, occurred many years later than soil quality, the terms have been used
interchangeably. For example, Haberern (1992), whose article appeared in the search result
for soil science journals, advocated for a soil health index as a report card to document
gains and losses in soil quality [ 54]. Moebius-Clune et al. (2016) posited that soil quality
and soil health could be considered synonymous [ 55]. Bünemann et al. (2018) suggested
that the preferred term depends on the stakeholders (i.e., soil quality for researchers and
soil health for farmers), although apparently there are no scientiﬁc surveys to validate
this argument [ 56]. Stevens (2018) deﬁned soil health as “a holistic measure of a soil’s
productivity, resilience, and sustainability [ 6]”. The concept is straightforward in the
abstract, yet challenging to deﬁne in practice from various viewpoints such as farmers, soil
scientists, economists, and policymakers.
Some prominent deﬁnitions of soil health and soil quality proposed over the past
20 years were summarized and compared by Mizuta et al. (2018) [2]. For example, Doran
and Saﬂey (1997) deﬁned it as the “continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living
system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain biological productivity;
promote the quality of air and water environments; and maintain plant, animal, and
human health [ 57]”. The U.S. Department of Agriculture—Natural Resources Conservation
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 12 of 19
Service (USDA-NRCS) simpliﬁed the deﬁnition of soil health in relation to soil quality
as “the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains
plants, animals, and humans” [ 58]. Stewart et al. (2018) proposed measuring the dynamic
variables that mainly fell within biological, environmental, and agronomic groups that
are responsive to soil management, such as cover crop, based on a meta-analysis of 192
unique peer-reviewed papers [59]. These variables include soil respiration, soil aggregate
stability, mineralizable nitrogen (N), soil erosion, inﬁltration, runoff, nutrient leaching,
weed control, diseases, soil fauna, microbial indicators, soil N 2O emissions, microbial
biomass N, and other soil health indicators. These variables were measured for traditional
soil surveys as indicators of soil quality. Instead, new aggregation methods of existing
soil information into a comprehensive, sensible, and scientiﬁc-sounding index are the
focal point of current discussions in the soil science community [ 5,60]. Thus, soil health
must be reconsidered similar to other soil concepts with the purpose of overcoming some
limitations of past soil survey efforts, such as inconsistent soil measurement protocols.
Under a large umbrella, the concepts of soil quality and soil health share the common goals
of multiple stakeholders by targeting sustainable soil resource management under natural
and anthropogenic pressures.
The earliest publication on soil sustainability was found in a soil science journal in
1992; one year later, a soil resilience paper appeared. These concepts were the only ones
found ﬁrst in soil science journals (Tables 4 and 5). Considering that the two concepts
appeared at almost the same time, they would likely share similar content, target, audiences,
and semantic deﬁnitions, because they may be used interchangeably. However, A. J. Friend
(1992), the author of the ﬁrst soil sustainability publication available in the Web of Science,
claimed differently [ 61]. The author ﬁrst deﬁned soil sustainability as the “susceptibility
of soil to change under natural or anthropogenic perturbations,” while soil resilience
was deﬁned as “soil’s ability to recover to the antecedent state following degradative
perturbation or change in land use.” Soil degradation would be the manifestation of a loss
of soil sustainability and resilience. The author also argued that soil sustainability was
characterized by three aspects, soil stability, soil resilience, and soil quality, all of which
can be inﬂuenced by soil surface management (e.g., tillage) to a large degree. This view
of soil stability and resilience seems to be consistent with other publications as well. For
example, Vogel et al. (2018) argued that the stability and resilience of soil are produced by
the complex interactions of functional soil attributes. The important question of how to
integrate fragmented knowledge on soil processes from various perspectives was addressed
in the article [62].
The roots of the resilience concept can be found in ecology [63]. C. S. Holling, whose
work was published in 1973, is considered to be the founder of modern ecological resilience
by distinguishing ecological and engineering resilience [ 64]. However, Olsson et al. (2015)
argued that the prevalent theory was not integrated with sociology as socio-ecological
resilience [ 65]. This integral development has altered the earlier deﬁnition of the ecological
resilience by a different view. Speciﬁcally, that resilience expresses the achievement of a
new state or equilibrium after perturbations.
Ludwig (2018) considered sustainability from a biodiversity perspective and asserted
that potential maximum ecological performance (MEP) is the measurable part of soil char-
acteristics for sustainable management [ 66]. Three ecological stages were delineated in
the framework: resistance, resilience, and regime. The threshold between the ﬁrst two
responses to a disturbance of the ecosystem is expressed by effective MEP , while the thresh-
old between the last two is characterized by potential MEP . However, the sustainability
framework is often rather holistic. Wu and Wu (2012) organized various indicator frame-
works based on social, environmental, economic, and institutional dimensions [ 67]. The
authors introduced hundreds of various indicators that would be aggregated into indices
as measures of sustainable development. The measures of soil sustainability and resilience
are still open for discussion. New techniques to quantify the functions or capabilities of
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 13 of 19
soils through integration of existing information with communal consensus seem valuable
in advancing the monitoring of soil resources for sustainable use.
The soil care concept does not seem to be used often in scientiﬁc journal publications.
The concept itself has not been discussed deeply, in terms of deﬁnitions, conceptual framing,
and practical applications. Review papers were not identiﬁed in the database. However,
the soil care concept may play a role as a foundation of various soil management strategies
based on top-down and bottom-up approaches. Yaalon (1996) deﬁned the concept as “the
activity of selecting and implementing, locally and regionally, a system of soil and land
use management suitable for maintaining and improving soil usefulness and quality for
any selected purpose [ 8].” Yaalon also argued that knowledge on the topic also needs
to be discussed deeply, quantiﬁed, and organized, similar to other soil concepts such as
soil sustainability. However, Krzywoszynska (2019) addressed the act of care beyond
ethical and practical commitments of securing matters by introducing attentiveness [ 7].
Attentiveness was described as a focal point to relational ethics as “attending to the non-
human other, of becoming response-able to them” (p. 4). According to the author, this
practice of attentiveness fosters ethical expansions and transformations through encounters
between humans and non-humans. Forming care networks of interconnected entities whose
existence enables the well-being of the primary object of care, soil is necessary. Grunwald
(2021) proposed a novel Pluralistic Integral Soil Ethics (PISE) framework of which one of
the pillars is soil care [ 68]. The ethics of soil care (relational ethics) is rooted in cognitive
empathy, which is what a person thinks and understands about soils and the environment,
and emotional empathy, which is what a person viscerally feels in relation to soils. Purely
cognitive empathy provides factual understanding about soils, while emotional empathy
is an embodied experience. They both rely on each other to support action, but empathic
concern is a necessity to bring forth compassionate actions (e.g., conservation management).
In essence, soil care arises from a compassionate lived emotive relationship between carer
(person/community) and cared-for (soil/land/nature). It follows that if somebody (or a
community) does not care for soil, and attributes less (or no) value to soil compared to
other things, soil degradation and loss in soil quality are tolerated. This conception of soil
care stands in contrast to earlier deﬁnitions by Yaloon and Wallace that are system-oriented
and only involve cognitive empathy.
Soil security also experienced its change point almost immediately after soil science
journals published articles. This indicates that publishing research on soil concepts in soil
science journals may be a key step in enhancing awareness of newly proposed soil concepts,
though the soil science community might not acknowledge the value of new ideas for
many years. Interestingly, the deﬁnition of soil security found in the ﬁrst article published
in a non-soil-science journal differed from the one ﬁrst published in a soil science journal.
Tadanier and Ingles (1985) used the term to refer to a physical feature of soil (i.e., water
retention ability) [ 69], while Bouma and McBratney (2013) used the term to frame soils as a
broader term to address environmental issues, deﬁning soil security as the “maintenance
or improvement of the world’s soil resource so it can provide sufﬁcient food and ﬁber,
fresh water, contribute to energy sustainability and climate stability, maintain biodiversity
and overall environmental protection and ecosystem services” [ 70]. Most of the results
for the soil security concept used the holistic deﬁnition. The sources of publications for
soil security can be found in Global Soil Security [71], though the Web of Science did not
recognize the book in the database. The ﬁrst book chapter conceptualized soil security
similarly to food and water security, though soil security was not perceived as a global
existential challenge by the public as much as the other security concepts were [ 72]. Bouma
and McBratney (2013) proposed the ﬁve C dimensions that deﬁne soil security: capability,
condition, capita, connectivity, and codiﬁcation [ 70]. Grunwald et al. (2017) proposed
another C, cognizance, as the fundamental factor that binds the other ﬁve dimensions [ 73].
This feature was characterized as ecological awareness that motivates actions that value,
care for, and secure limited natural resources. Although all aforementioned soil concepts
aim to protect and preserve soils, their underlying motivations and justiﬁcations differ
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 14 of 19
widely [ 68]. Soil quality, soil health, and soil fertility (and possibly soil productivity as well)
have a tight linkage to agricultural production systems, in which the values of the concepts
are found in optimized management so that they meet the needs of people and, potentially,
other organisms. An anthropocentric stance undergirds soil conservation, suggesting that
humans control soil/land/nature to provide beneﬁts for people and the environment. Soil
sustainability is associated with “good” stewardship for future generations, while the
security of soils refers to being free from the risk of losing functionality and goods and
services of sustainable environment [10].
4.2. Factors for Propagating New Ideas in Soil Science
Overall, many soil concepts appeared in soil science journals 20 years or more after
they appeared in non-soil-science journals for the ﬁrst time. This reﬂects the soil science
community’s slow adaptation to new concepts. However, the earlier a soil concept appeared
in the ﬁrst article in the category ‘all journal’, the earlier the change points occurred in
general, except for soil quality and soil health (A and C-A in Table 7). This phenomenon
is possibly due to the more recent rapid increase in the number of articles on newer soil
concepts (Figure 1). Publishing new soil concepts in soil science journals is essential for
the soil science community to recognize and build communal understanding and values
though that would not be a sufﬁcient factor. Sharing a new concept with a large general
readership would also help the propagation of soil concepts.
Older concepts were generally cited more over time (Table 3, Figure 1). The minimum
number of citations necessary to experience a statistical change point of the publications
or a citation inﬂation in soil science journals was 57 (Table 3), while the number for all
journals was 119 (Table 3). The readership of journal subscribers/attention/citations
has varied by journal over time, though each journal has ﬁxed scopes/aims/deﬁnitions
and speciﬁc readers. Publishing soil concept articles in a journal with a large readership
would be the best strategy, or creating a journal based on a given soil concept is another
strategy. For instance, the change point for a number of publications on soil conservation
occurred the same year that the JSWC published the ﬁrst articles (Table 7). Out of 798 and
49 journals in all journals and soil science journals, the journal published the most articles
on soil conservation.
To enhance attention from soil science communities and beyond, other important
factors must be considered. Rogers (2010) proposed the diffusion of innovation theory
to explain how and at what rate a new idea or technology spreads in an organization
or community [ 74]. The diffusion approach has been used to evaluate the impact of
development programs in agriculture, family planning, public health, and other ﬁelds.
According to Rogers, there are ﬁve elements of a new concept/idea/innovation that will
each partly determine whether the adoption or diffusion of a new one will occur: relative
advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. These elements are
designed to answer some of the same questions raised in this study (e.g., Why do certain
innovative ideas spread more quickly than others, and why do others fail?). Relative
advantage is the degree to which a new concept is perceived as better or more useful for
particular stakeholders. Compatibility is the degree to which a new concept is consistent
with or relevant to existing experiences, values, and the needs of stakeholders. Complexity
evaluates how easily a new concept is comprehended—that is, the easier the concept is
to understand, the more rapidly it can spread. Trialability indicates whether a new idea
can be tested repeatedly. The last criterion, observability, ensures that a new concept will
produce visible results.
The ﬁrst three elements of the diffusion theory are essential to improve the adaptabil-
ity of new ideas for various stakeholders. For example, the choice of wording may draw
different associations and intuitions that could track the attention of stakeholders. Puig
de la Bellacasa (2015) stated that soil care is a widely used notion, though the publication
result for this concept was relatively low [ 75]. The term soil care has been associated with
intimate relationships, nurturing motherly care (for something or somebody), qualitative
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 15 of 19
values (e.g., long-term sustainability to secure our children’s future), and the feminine,
which have been devalued in the sciences and overpowered in societies attuned to prof-
itability (e.g., maximize crop production from soil), achievement (e.g., maximize soil carbon
sequestration), power, and doing-orientation (e.g., manage and control soils, production
agriculture, or “ﬁx the soil degradation crisis”). More discussions on the soil care concept
can be found in Grunwald (2021) [68].
Earlier concepts of soil, on the other hand, seem to be limited to agricultural perspec-
tives but were cited in many publications. Multiple factors explain the propagation of
new ideas in a community, including needs (e.g., soil degradation); crises/problems (e.g.,
the Dust Bowl, global climate change); curiosity; psychological (e.g., spiritual or inner
motivation to use speciﬁc soil concepts); and social (tribal patterns, e.g., scientists may feel
inclined to study soil health because their colleagues study soil health).
Social and environmental changes, along with technological advancements and public
awareness regarding the need for poverty reduction and sustainable management of natural
resources, have impacted public or professional organizations and soil science. Trends in
science can shift over time based on the interests of scientists and funding agencies [ 76].
The prominence of conceptual studies in the literature reﬂects a given research emphasis
and how it has sustained momentum over time.
Soil quality is a good example: it has a clear history of broadening its deﬁnition to
address complex soil/environmental challenges [ 31,49]. These conceptual criteria can also
be found in the assessments of various soil concept indices. For example, Karlen et al.
(1997) asserted that the critical characteristics of a soil quality framework should be that it
is (1) inﬂuential for the purpose of the assessment (i.e., relative advantage); (2) measurable
(i.e., trialability/observability); and (3) sensitive to detect differences at the point scale
in time and space (i.e., compatibility) [ 46]. Doran (2002) proposed that the important
criteria for soil quality/health indices are (1) utility and accessibility for agricultural spe-
cialists, producers, conservationists, and policymakers (relative advantage/complexity,
trialability, and observability) and (2) sensitivity to management and climatic variations
(compatibility) [77].
Despite the conceptual criteria for the adoption or diffusion of a new concept, this
study offers practical viewpoints for propagating awareness of soil concepts. The choice of
journals in which to publish articles on a soil concept inﬂuences the citation trend of soil
concepts. The large audience/readership outside of the soil science communities needs to
be considered because 63% of the citations for the soil concepts selected for this study were
from non-soil-science journals. The united efforts of professional organizations/institutes
within a country are also valued. It is notable that publication sizes for authors in the
Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) for many soil concepts were the largest, including soil
conservation, fertility, productivity, quality, and sustainability. This observation may be
linked to a large number of scientists from 114 institutions under the CAS, which is the
world’s largest research organization recognized by Nature Index [ 78]. However, one might
claim that this is not a fair comparison because many countries, including the U.S., have
not adopted the scheme that the Chinese have. Collaborations across nations or people
who speak different native languages is another factor in determining scientiﬁc awareness
as a part of cultural adaptability. The most prominent languages varied depending on the
soil concept, but the least cited concepts—soil care and soil security—were only published
in English. Efforts by a single organization (i.e., the University of Sydney) contributed the
majority of publications on soil security in all journals (39.4%) and soil science journals
(46.7%), which indicates the monopolization. However, opposite trends were found for
other soil concepts that showed pronounced diversiﬁcation in the form of English/non-
English publications indicating cultural and social adaptability.
A cultural or typological aspect may play an important role in restricting citations. Lal
(1993) referred to soil resilience as “soil’s ability to recover to the antecedent state following
degradative perturbation or change in land use” [ 20]. However, Olsson et al. (2015)
argued that the use of the term “resilience” in the natural sciences may cause disciplinary
Appl. Sci. 2021 ,11, 4275 16 of 19
tensions with the social sciences [ 65]. The application of resilience theory may change the
deﬁnition from coherent to internally contradictory, from precise to vague, from descriptive
to normative to predictive, and from concise to comprehensive. Sojka et al. (2003) also
warned that the vague quality of assessments requires deconstruction for interpretation [ 9].
Expanding stakeholders by broadening soil concepts may succeed in considering diverse
stakeholders and functions of soils, but it also seems to be a tradeoff with the possibility
of losing the capability for scientiﬁc advancement. Furthermore, vagueness can confuse
readers/users, and, as a result, divisions within soil science might be created. Soil quality
and soil health are good examples because these are interchangeably used depending on
the author.
4.3. Limitations of This Research and Future Research
Some limitations of the study can be opportunities for future research. Some articles
originally written in German were identiﬁed in the English translation, so articles in original
languages other than English might not be as readily accessible to readers in the Web of
Science. Adding other sources, such as Google Scholar, may retrieve soil concept articles
unavailable in the Web of Science.
In addition, different search settings may produce different results for total citations
for all journals and soil science journals. The wildcard character and quotation marks were
used to identify exact phrases of soil concepts with slight ﬂexibility in plurality (e.g., soil
care and soil cares). However, some articles—for instance, the paper titled “Soil structure
and sustainability” [ 79]—were not counted in the total citations for soil sustainability in all
journals. Thus, expanding searchability may increase the chance of ﬁnding unidentiﬁed
articles published earlier than those found in this study.
5. Conclusions
Soil concepts have emerged at different times, often changing in the frequency of their
use and their meanings over time. Whether soil concepts persist, are replaced, diffuse, or
make room for new ones reﬂects real societal needs and improved scientiﬁc understanding.
However, soil scientists may require decades of time and a signiﬁcant number of publi-
cations published in soil and non-soil-science journals to adopt new ideas within the soil
science community. The increasing number of citations in both the short- and long-term
also requires the expansion of audience/stakeholders in different countries/organizations,
including those who use languages other than English or Chinese as their primary lan-
guage. While not every soil concept has attracted widespread interest, those cited more
than 50 times in the soil science journals have tended to acquire momentum, communal
value, and understanding in diverse communities. Establishing new concepts with a lack
of novel semantics inherently risks creating communication barriers between scientists
and other stakeholders, speciﬁcally if those concepts are regarded as scientiﬁc buzzwords
and/or jargon. Older soil concepts that emerged in soil science journals in the early 1900s
apparently related to agriculture and productivity. The newer concepts developed since the
1970s address management, functionality (e.g., soil security and soil health), and biocentric
themes (e.g., soil resilience). Within the semantic ﬁeld, it seems that the original meaning
of a speciﬁc soil concept at emergence relaxes and broadens over time, with research
publications diverting from the original deﬁnition. This phenomenon is exempliﬁed by the
concept of soil health, with exponentially growing publications over the past decade but a
loss of clear and precise semantics of the term soil health.
The deﬁnition of each concept has been modiﬁed over time, depending on external
crises in society/environment (e.g., global climate change, food security) and/or internal
interests within the soil science community. The soil concepts that are successfully popular-
ized will likely be impacted in the future by shifts from disciplinary soil-centered research
toward more inter- and trans-disciplinary environmental research as global ecological and
humanitarian crises intensify.
