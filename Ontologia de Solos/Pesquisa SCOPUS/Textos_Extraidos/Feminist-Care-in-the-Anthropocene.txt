ABSTRACT 
As posthumanist or post-anthropocentric research in HCI and 
design proliferates and further commits to working with more-
than-humans, design research practitioners are left with many 
open questions and uncertainties with how to productively engage 
with more-than-humans in their thinking and working. This paper 
present results from a workshop with 17 researchers working at 
the intersection of care ethics and posthumanism to highlight ten-
sions in posthumanist engagement aimed at unpacking some of the 
challenges, obstacles, and questions encountered by researchers 
interested in more-than-human centered design. In foregrounding 
tensions with representation, legitimization, unseen labor, and ma-
terial narratives we contribute to a design research agenda which 
seeks to explicate and challenge dominant anthropocentric forces 
from design. We conclude by discussing epistemological care and 
urge practitioners to take up new ways of imagining through truly 
messy methods which contribute to a feminist unsettling of HCI’s 
methodological commitments, practices, and praxis.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3532106.3533540 Computer Interaction (HCI) and related felds such as Science and 
Technologies Studies (STS) have embraced this term and work to un-
derstand anthropocentric ways of thinking and knowing. They aim 
to characterize the political, epistemological, and ontological excep-
tionalism from which human’s many exploitative and destructive 
activities originate. Complicit in these efects, HCI designers and 
researchers have begun to see their role, at best, as “sustaining the 
unsustainable” [52] or at worst as “defuturing ” [ibib:10] by means of 
actively negating futures for humans and non-humans through un-
sustainable or irresponsible designs. If, as feminist STS scholar Lucy 
Suchman reminds us, design’s agenda is to produce “technologies as 
knowledges objectifed in a particular way” [106:3] then practition-
ers have rightfully begun asking what kinds of things, worlds, or 
futures are being produced from that anthropocentric and objectify-
ing standpoint. According to Colombian American anthropologist 
Arturo Escobar, the feld requires “a signifcant reorientation of de-
sign from the functionalist, rationalistic, and industrial traditions 
from which it emerged, and within which it still functions at ease, 
towards a type of rationality and set of practices attuned to the rela-
tional dimension of life” [46:42]. In response to these concerns, HCI 
has increasingly turned to Euro-Western posthumanist scholarship 
which rejects human exceptionalism and positions humans’ agency 
as distributed amongst a web of non-human forces in which hu-
mans participate but to not intrinsically control. Often in response 
to the climate crisis, HCI has adopted posthumanist philosophies 
in an attempt to “de-center” humans from within. Posthumanist or 
post-anthropocentric research in HCI and design has been growing 
with projects ranging from designing for human-fungi survival 
[81], to wearable designs for environmental speculation [31], to 
expanding participation methods to include non-humans [6], to 
name only a few. However, as the discipline continues to grapple 
with existing and emerging theories and practices to reframe de-
sign, many uncertainties with how to productively embody, design, 
and engage with posthumanist design research remain. 
With these concerns comes a need to care in new and scalar ways. 
As a means of accounting for those “relational dimension of life” 
called for by Escobar, researchers have turned to care ethics as a 
strategy to explicate and challenge dominant anthropocentric forces 
from design. Care as a feminist practice is about attending to what, 
how, and when things get caring attention and come to matter and 
what, how, and when things don’t. It is a relational, embodied, and 
ongoing practice which is necessarily particular. So, as practitioners 
work to understand and express non-anthropocentric alternatives 
for living in worlds “as well as possible” [48:40] we similarly need 
methods, capacities, and an ethic which is relational, particular, and 
non-just-human centered.

In ‘Letters to Joan Tronto,’ feminist scholars Talevi, Bailer, and 
Karjevsky ask what we need to “pack with us and what to unpack 
amongst us” [95:40] as people who care about care. Inspired by 
their metaphor (which conveys the importance of the journey not 
over but alongside the destination), this paper contributes learnings 
from the workshop titled Alternative Care Translations: A Work-
shop Using Care as a Lens for Speculative Posthumanism. This 
workshop gathered designers, researchers, philosophers, and artists 
working at the intersection of care and posthumanism to explore 
practices, theories, and open questions around how we actually go 
about negotiating those collaborative (or more-than-just-human) 
determinations of “as well as possible. ” Feminist care ethics was a 
critical lens for grounding the workshop’s activities as well as scaf-
folding attendants’ refections, “not as a stable heuristic but a context 
driven, and relational tool for both doing and noticing, not necessarily 
in that order” [72:12]. For STS scholar María Puig de la Bellacasa, 
“care is relational per se. . .this also means that an understanding of 
human agencies as immersed in worlds made of heterogeneous but 
interdependent forms and processes of life and matter, to or not to care 
about/for something/somebody, inevitably does and undoes relation” 
[91:69]. The polyphonies between a care ethics and posthumanist 
agenda provided rich foundational and material points of departure 
for speculating alternative modes of more-than-human care. 
Care, as a political, ethical, and material engagement with the 
excluded or devalued has long been of concern for feminist thinkers 
[66]. However, when it comes to more-than-human relations, the 
place-based experience (e.g., [73]) and scholarly discourse of In-
digenous thinkers and activists (e.g., [107, 111, 124]) have largely 
been excluded or devalued. Euro-Western discourses often treat the 
Anthropocene (and undergirding Cartesian divide) “as a teleologi-
cal fact implicating all humans as equally culpable for the current 
socio-economic, ecological, and political state of the world” [111:252]. 
However, there are knowledge systems which have long understood 
the theoretical and lived reality of the infnitesimal relationality 
and reciprocity of life, climate, knowing, and being [112]. In ad-
dition to the feminist Euro-Western body of theoretical work on 
care and posthumanism, this paper turns to Indigenous Knowledge 
(or Indigenous Ecological Knowledge) not just to amplify voices, 
inspire readers through colorful metaphor, romanticize ways of 
life, or ofer ornaments to reckon with the authors’ (or possibly 
readers’) lack of prior engagement with Indigenous cosmologies 
which proceed and exceed modern posthumanist thought. Rather, 
we are motivated by a humble and genuine desire to learn from 
scholars and exemplars whose place-based and relational praxis 
has a lot to teach. The authors are Euro-Western scholars who 
have benefted from settler colonialisms in the USA and UK which 
have systematically displaced and suppressed the very ideas and 
individuals relied upon in this paper. So, while the authors have 
tried to understand and learn from Indigenous perspectives, we 
do not claim them as our own and recognize the invaluable yet 
unidirectional beneft they provide. In engaging with these ideas, 
we must acknowledge the uneven and unjust frameworks upon 
which this work was built and disseminated. 
As more researchers and designers undertake posthumanist or 
more-than-human projects we hope to contribute fndings from 
these workshops which trouble enduringly normative and euro-
centric ways of engaging with more-than-humans. By leveraging the expertise and emergent experience of individuals working with 
research artifacts, methods, and orientations towards posthuman-
ist design and the politics and ethics of care, we explore how we 
might operate and conduct research diferently in the face of such 
sticky normativity. We contribute to pluriversal design agendas 
through layering posthumanist, feminist, and Indigenous Knowl-
edges combined with a making-as-knowing approach which fore-
grounds tensions with representation, legitimization, unseen labor, 
and material narratives. This work showcases how care ethics can 
be used to concretely attend to productions of subjects and objects 
and to how those anthropocentric mechanisms of production shape 
the capacities of care relations between humans and non-humans. 
Lastly, this paper contributes a discussion on epistemological care 
and urges practitioners to take up new ways of imagining through 
truly messy methods which contributed to a necessarily intersec-
tional feminist unsettling of HCI’s methodological commitments, 
practices, and praxis. 
2 MORE-THAN-HUMAN RESEARCH IN HCI 
Euro-Western design as a discipline has primarily concerned itself 
with human functionalism—with creating useful things to advance 
humans’ needs and desires. As with Euro-Western design generally, 
HCI has historically privileged humanist ideals and agendas as it 
extracts, exploits, and overlooks non-human species, matter, and 
systems. However, as HCI scholars have begun to acknowledge the 
existential and material consequences of this humanist approach 
they are forced to reckon with their role in those consequences. 
Afterall, Ann Light et al. assert, “we have claimed a stake in the pro-
duction of futures” [80:723] and therefore have sought alternatives 
in post-capitalist, post-anthropocentric, and posthumanist projects 
in an efort to counter those efects from within. 
Although many of the predominant ideas in more-than-human 
HCI research are derived from, and readily present in, discourses 
of Indigenous scholars and activists, Euro-Western design and HCI 
scholars have ‘re-discovered’ the need for an ontological reposi-
tioning to support these preferable futures [112]. To make this turn, 
scholars have relied heavily on the feminist Euro-Western body of 
theoretical work on posthumanism, which in essence, “expands the 
circle of moral concern, extending subjectivities beyond the human 
species” [17:3]. Feminist STS scholars like Donna Haraway have 
focused on bridging the gap between nature and culture towards a 
more relational ‘natureculture’ [59, 62] and emphasize networks 
and relationships of kinship rather than exploitation [61] while 
Braidotti [34] focuses on the bio-politics of human-centered ecolog-
ical devastation. Feminist new materialists such as De Wolf [38] 
and Bennett [ 28] work to breakdown dichotomies of alive vs inert 
or agental vs non-agental warning that “the image of dead or thor-
oughly instrumentalized matter feeds human hubris and our earth-
destroying fantasies of conquest and consumption” [27:ix]. Karen 
Barad synthesizes new materialist and queer theories to propose a 
posthumanist, or agential realist, account which “calls into question 
the givenness of the diferential categories of “human” and “non-
human, ” examining the practices through which these diferential 
boundaries are stabilized and destabilized” [14:808]. These and other 
678

eforts argue in various ways to acknowledge existing and foster fu-
ture relationships with actants both human and non-human which 
are less hierarchical. 
To address the presumed need to support alternative techno-
futures with fatter, more harmonious, and therefore more just and 
sustaining relationships with non-humans and our shared envi-
ronments, there have been an increasing number of proposals to 
de-center design from within HCI (e.g., [24, 64, 80, 104, 109, 118]). 
Researchers have looked to these and other theories such as critical 
race and decolonial theory (e.g., [49]), object-oriented ontology 
(e.g., [123]), and care ethics (e.g., [71]). Projects in the feld of Sus-
tainable Human Computer Interaction (SHCI), in particular, have 
long been sensitive to the many co-constituting relationships be-
tween humans and nonhumans. To bring humans and ecologies into 
conversation, researchers have engaged in posthumanist ethnogra-
phies, for example, detailing symbiotic encounters with companion 
species [84], exploring ontological alternatives for agricultural tech-
nology [29], and using permaculture to show how technology can 
support working with nature rather than controlling it [83]. 
Although many of these projects remain more theoretically ori-
ented, researchers have also productively grounded their inquiries 
in designerly practices such as photography to examine naturecul-
tures [82], speculative design artifacts which explore personal and 
bodily encounters with climate change [31] or how repair and 
care can challenge hierarchical human-object narratives [72]. Re-
searchers have adopted and adapted methodologies such as an-
thropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing’s ‘arts of noticing’ [116] to 
expand participation in research to non-humans [6], or to design 
with non-humans for collaborative survival [81]. Biggs et al. blend 
‘arts of noticing’ with making practices to interrogate their psy-
chological attachment to the subject/object hierarchy, describing 
it more as a subject/abject relationship [ 30]. Jönsson et al. borrow 
from Barad’s notions of posthumanist performativity to introduce 
‘performative prototypes’ which engage in materially speculative 
co-design with humans and non-humans alike [69]. 
These projects share a commitment to working with design as 
a discipline and phenomena to conceive of and realize better fu-
tures for more than just humans. However, the project is scalar, it 
is plural, and the work of self-critiquing and challenging some of 
its longest-standing commitments has just begun. We argue that a 
posthumanist design agenda must materially attend to its ethical 
commitments in connection to its ontological and epistemologi-
cal ones—troubling and nuancing prevailing notions of justice and 
agency as entangled, unfxed, and a bumpy rather than fat territory. 
Without reducing one to the other (or suggesting that either have 
all the answers), this paper will attempt to demonstrate that femi-
nist ethics of care and Indigenous Ecological Knowledge are well 
suited to the task. Although originating from and diverging to quite 
diferent places these two bodies of knowledge share a faithfulness 
to relational understandings and expressions of subjects, labors, 
places, and temporalities which are based in concrete diferences 
rather than universalized objectifcations. 
3 ETHICS OF CARE AND RELATIONALITY 
The notion of an ethical imperative to recognize the life-giving 
relationships between humans and non-humans (and that such an ethic would account for how the past is simultaneously enacted in 
the present, therefore shaping how we conceptualize the future) 
is well understood in many Indigenous philosophies of ecology. 
Papaschase Cree scholar of Pedagogy Dwayne Donald describes 
such an ethic—ethical relationality—as “an ecological understanding 
of human relationality that does not deny diference . . .This form of 
relationality is ethical because it does not overlook or invisibilize the 
particular historical, cultural, and social contexts from which a par-
ticular person understands and experiences living in the world. It puts 
these considerations at the forefront of engagements across frontiers 
of diference” [45:6]. Although Donald developed this idea of ethical 
relationality in the context of Canadian-Indigenous curriculum it is 
important to understand the breath of Donald’s notion of ecology 
(from Cree and Blackfoot philosophies) which entails “paying atten-
tion to the webs of relationships that you are enmeshed in, depending 
on where you live. So, those are all the things that give us life, all 
the things that we depend on, as well as all the other entities that we 
relate to, including human beings” [44]. Henceforth, an ecological 
understanding of human relationality and ethical responsibility 
is a critical point of departure both from Kantian ethics but also 
from many approaches to euro-centric more-than-human research 
which, in its zeal to decenter humans, erases rather than recognizes 
human diferences—efectively emancipating humans from that 
ethical imperative. 
Feminist ethics of care is similarly committed to understanding 
interdependence or relationality as an essential organizing force 
in the world [112] while stressing how those relations are neces-
sarily particular and situated [45] and privileges responsibility and 
reciprocity [48] in its understanding of those relations. Although 
historically oriented towards problematic human-human relations, 
it is precisely because of care ethic’s concrete and particularized (vs 
generalized) consideration of selves and others [25] when interro-
gating the processes, matterings, and materials needed to maintain 
a world that feminist STS scholars like María Puig de la Bellacasa 
see such potential in “involving a feminist vision of care in the politics 
of things [which] both encourages and problematizes the possibility 
of translating ethico-political caring into ways of thinking with non-
humans” [91:30]. In her invocation of ‘thinking with,’ Puig de la 
Bellacasa suggests not just an epistemic relationship, but that care 
is at the heart of matters all along a “naturecultural ontological con-
tinuum” [ibib:52], suggesting that looking into the ethico-politics 
of care for agencies, things, and entities opens possibilities of under-
standing and representing their relationships without ‘re-objectify’ 
them. 
Although care ethics has a robust legacy within feminist study 
(e.g., [5, 25, 48, 66]) and STS (e.g., [23, 67, 86 it has a relatively new 
(though generative) and predominantly human-centered history 
within HCI and design (e.g., [1, 12, 26, 94]). Care as an ethico-
political nexus has proven a potent way to understand technology-
mediated social spaces like a home (e.g., [19]), communities such as 
hacker collectives (e.g., [113]) or to trouble researcher / participant 
engagement in general (e.g., [77, 78, 115]). A recent strand of HCI 
has used care ethics as both theoretical and material medium for 
doing research with non-humans or not-just-humans. For example, 
Bardzell et al. analyzed ethnographies of farming practices to spec-
ulatively imagine how HCI might shift away from anthropocentric 
functionalism in pursuit of more care-ful relationships [17]. Key 
679
DIS ’22, June 13–17, 2022, Virtual Event, Australia Cayla Key et al. 
et al. used care ethics as an analytic and speculative lens to ofer 
alternative design considerations through more-than-human frame-
works for embodiment, positionality, temporality, and reciprocity 
[71]. Wakkary uses care to make visible the politics and ethics of 
things—with which designers (or co-biographers) need to more fully 
engage if they ever hope to design for more-than-human-centered 
worlds [118]. 
These projects work to shift an underlying question in more-
than-human HCI from ‘how can humans care more’ to “what hap-
pens to our work when we pay attention to moments where the ques-
tion of ‘how to care?’ is insistent but not easily answerable” [91:7]. 
With this uneasy insistence comes opportunities but also responsi-
bilities to address the efects of those ethical conditions. We argue 
it is crucial to adopt non-anthropocentric ethics as an essential 
process of worlding when reworking those conditions. In the same 
way that posthumanist HCI has been driven to reject boundaries be-
tween human and non-human, “such a posthuman ethics contradicts 
the humanist assumption of a proper boundary between ethics and 
politics, agency and subjectivation, autonomy and dependence” [10:2]. 
An attention to the entangled ethics of things might resist univer-
salizing tendencies by encouraging more specifcity to the forces 
sustaining perceived boundaries between particular humans and 
particular non-humans. Lastly, we argue that such an ethical orien-
tation works to keep humans responsible to an ethical imperative to 
recognize non-human labors and agencies through acknowledging 
diference. Within the current discourse on more-than-human HCI 
we fnd it pertinent to remember Puig de la Bellacasa’s words: “care 
is not about fusion; it can be about the right distance” [91:5]. 
4 ALTERNATIVE CARE TRANSLATIONS 
WORKSHOP 
To open up conversation and tease out tensions with posthumanist 
engagement two workshops were held over the course of several 
weeks with 17 participants. The primary goal was to engage in 
posthuman speculation vis-a-vis care. This was done through two 
individual embodied speculative activities followed by small group 
discussions and a fnal collective group discussion at the end. 
As designers and design researchers (especially as research-
through-design, critical design, and speculative design expand and 
develop) the need for practice as well as theory to advance a posthu-
manist agenda is made clearer and more urgent. This work is part 
of a lineage of workshops conducted in HCI which uses design-
erly methods such as rapid prototyping (e.g., [8]) sketching (e.g., 
[105]), other forms of ‘thinking through making’ [126] or embodied 
speculation [36] with participants. In this case, participants en-
gaged in making in order to generate “back-talk” [97:79] to discuss 
with other practitioners, creating a materially discursive workshop. 
Çerçi et al.’s analysis of how probes are used in design research 
assert that when designers engage in making it amplifes designerly 
tendencies, brings materials into conversation, captures current 
interpretations, and foregrounds decision-making [37]. These were 
key elements to consider for practitioners trying to disrupt and in-
terrogate their own mental schema, as humans trying to de-center 
humans in design. 
While workshops with other researchers are incredibly common, 
as conference activities (e.g., [7]), to pilot methods, share practices (e.g., [47]), develop new directions (e.g., [102]) etc. they are less com-
monly reported in archival publications (see e.g., [11, 92, 128] as 
notable exceptions). One related trend in HCI is for small groups of 
scholars to engage in collective refection, retrospective, or ethnog-
raphy (e.g., [13, 40, 55, 68, 127]) as part of a refective practice to 
“re-understand their own role in the technology design process” and 
“uncover and alter the limitations of design practice” [98:7]. In these 
and other frst-person accounts, researchers become research par-
ticipants. As is the case with duoethnography, trioethnography, 
etc., each person’s experiences and refections are positioned in 
dialogue with other research participants’ [ 96] resulting in refrac-
tions, parallels, juxtapositions, and debate. These were foundational 
aspirations for the Alternative Translations Workshop. Further in-
spired by critical refexive practice in feminist HCI [18], our pro-
cess used participants’ dialogic accounts to examinate the situated 
ethico-political underpinnings of designs, design practices, and 
designer/researcher positionality in an attempt learn and unlearn 
together. 
4.1 Recruitment 
To realize collective and discursive refection on researchers’ per-
sonal approaches to posthumanist and care-ful design we recruited 
practitioners working with either or both theoretical bodies. Al-
though most of the participants engage in that work via HCI we 
choose not to limit the participant pool to technology spaces alone 
as other disciplines such as anthropology, philosophy, and art have 
made signifcant contributions to posthumanist and care theory 
which are germane to HCI. The initial pool of potential participants 
consisted of 38 individuals which were identifed through a pro-
cess of literature review, a call to participate in the Care Matters 
reading group (organized by anthropologists Ioanna Manoussaki 
Adamopoulou and Emilie Glazer for which the frst author is a 
member), and through the recommendation of fellow researchers 
who’s networks extended out to include early stage researchers and 
PhD students whose interests and knowledge might not be well 
represented in current literature. Each of these individuals were 
emailed a brief which explained the purpose, goals, the general 
structure of the workshop, and invitation to attend one of two on-
line sessions. From this process, 17 participants were confrmed, 9 
for workshop 1 and 8 for workshop 2. 
Although the participants represent a diversity of experience, 
methodological practice, theoretical grounding, worldviews, and 
areas of discipline, the original list of 38 was by no means exhaus-
tive. Researchers were almost entirely from the Global North for 
example, and selection of the fnal 17 participants was made based 
on pragmatic factors such as availability and the desire for some 
symmetry across the two sessions in terms of overall number of 
participants as well as expertise. This process of selecting partici-
pants can certainly be seen as a limitation of this work which will 
always be partial. However, we see this limitation, in part, as the 
result of a genuine efort to assemble a multi-disciplinary group 
capable of the types of materially discursive refractions, parallels, 
juxtapositions, and debates mentioned earlier in the paper while 
simultaneously recognizing that we can and should do better.

ments. The micro-situation demonstrated here is ‘putting on a shirt.’ Sonic phenomena were created using a bone key, radiator, 
carpet, window, skin, hair, water heater, and more. 
4.2 Participants 
Researchers who participated came with their own sets of practices, 
knowledge, concerns, and dilemmas which were equally valuable 
and vital to the discursive goals of the workshops. Participants’ 
research projects range from exploring the agentic materiality of 
human-data relationships [39], posthuman design for transitions 
to renewable energies [93], how care ethics can advance pedagogy 
[99], the UX of climate change [22], blending postphenomenology 
and thing-perspectives [ 88], using the practice of BioArt to explore 
relational ontology [51] and arguing for the integration of a feminist 
care ethics perspective in HCI [115] to name just a few examples 
(see appendix for further details on participants). 
However, because of the critical, refective, and multidisciplinary 
nature of the workshops, participants occupied a somewhat dual 
role, at once expert researchers and research participants. As such, 
participants will be referred to by their initials as a narrative device 
refecting the liminality and at times vulnerability of the workshop 
space when participants refexively fuctuated between discussing 
nascent experiences and deeply considered notions. 
4.3 Structure and Activities 
To broaden reach and accommodate geographically diverse partici-
pation, each workshop took place online via Zoom and Miro and 
lasted approximately 2.5 hours. The sessions began with a brief 
introduction by the frst author to help frame goals and activities 
of the session. Participants were invited to introduce themselves 
and share what they hoped to get out of the event. The workshop 
consisted of two main activities and a fnal group discussion. Both 
activities centered around the theme of translations. As art curator 
and philosopher Nicolas Bourriaud states: “translation always im-
plies adapting the meaning of a proposition, enabling it to pass from one code to another... Every translation is inevitably incomplete and 
leaves behind an irreducible remainder” [33:30]. In foregrounding 
that human-nonhuman translations will always be reductions, it 
was our hope that participants might begin to uncover ways to 
take responsibility for—and attend to the specifcity of—how those 
reductions, adaptations, and remainders are produced, as a matter 
of ethics and care. 
Activity 1: Micro-Situation Reenactments . This activity was 
designed to enlarge participants thinking [25] through resonant 
translations. Participants were asked to choose a micro-situation 
(inspired by [71]), which could be a ritual, a habit, a lark, a hap-
pening (e.g., milk being delivered to the front door, rain washing 
away your kid’s sidewalk chalk, brushing your teeth, sun fading a 
rug near a window, etc.) to physically reenact (Figure 1). In this ac-
tivity, participants used their homes as companion landscapes and 
partners in these activities to think co-speculatively with. During 
their reenactments participants created new sonic phenomena and 
were more attuned to existing ones by tapping, rustling, grinding, 
swishing, etc. as they reenacted and noticed diferences, harmonies, 
dissonances, echoes, ambiance, and vibrations (Figure 2). Finally, 
they translated or annotated their experiences which they discussed 
in small groups of 3-4 after completing their own reenactments. 
Participants were provided a series of prompts to guide their group 
discussions such as: what labor (human and non-human) is involved 
at each step and how visible it is? What gets neglected so that this 
micro-situation can occur? In this scenario what is providing care 
and what is provided/denied care? And what do you think counts 
as a world? 
The goal of this activity was not to see from the perspective of 
another thing, rather it was for participants to see their own bodies

in thicker relation to other things (so that they might begin to chal-
lenge those relational hierarchies) through embodied translations. 
The aim was to tune in so that non-human liveliness might reach 
a point of expressivity, legibility, and ultimately translatability al-
lowing a particular world to emerge to a particular human. This is 
essential when attuning to the particular conditions (rather than 
voices) of more-than-human relations and engaging them critically. 
Activity 2: Speculative Translations. The second activity was 
aimed at exploring alternative care relationships through specu-
lative human-thing translations. This activity was very much in-
spired by Tsing’s writing on translations in the context of human-
mushroom relations. She writes: [capitalism] "translates across living arrangements, turning worlds into assets . . . Alienation is that form 
of disentanglement that allows the making of capitalist assets...from 
all kinds of livelihoods, human and non-human" [116:133]. Tsing’s 
insight potently provokes the speculative question: then what else 
might we use to translate between entangled worlds? So, for the 
second activity’s move towards speculation we asked participants 
to experiment or play with translating other conditions by expand-
ing or redirecting who and what gets attention from individuals or 
regimes of care. 
Participants each choose one condition such as land ownership, 
oral history, sanctuary status, etc. to translate between non-humans

in their micro-situation (Figure 3). They were then asked to materi-
alize their speculative world using basic ofce and home supplies 
such as printers, tape, paper, string, thread, water, Play-Doh, maga-
zines, etc. letting the materials help evoke the new conditions of the 
landscape. Participants could play with what new infrastructures of 
care would need to emerge to enable that world, or how labors and 
resources would move because of that translation. Lastly, partici-
pants wrote a haiku to punctuate their world. Participants would 
again discuss their experiences in the same small groups of 3-4 
from the previous activity. The workshops ended with a collective 
group discussion where we tried to zoom out and identify complex-
ities, uncertainties, and provocations for posthumanist research 
and design. 
Combining modalities of reenactment, discussion, crafting, and 
writing throughout the workshop resulted in myriad creative out-
puts ranging from a sonic remix of the sounds of decaying food, to a 
hand drawn image of pneumatic tube infrastructure for hand cream, 
and a speculative assemblage with a succulent connected to a mo-
tor with an alligator clip, and more (Figure 4). These outputs were important for analysis but also for participants to fnd interstices 
between thinking and doing, between human and non-human. 
4.4 Making Sense of the Data 
Workshop material in the form of transcripts, notes, and screen 
captures from the many Miro boards which include images, sticky 
notes, poems, collages, audio fles, and GIFs served as the dataset for 
formal analysis and for a zine/token to thank workshop participants. 
Yet what began as two discrete activities (zine making and formal 
analysis), collapsed into a blended process of making, curating, 
coding, theme fnding, and narrative building. The process began 
with an initial round of open coding with printed transcripts and 
screen captures cut into interesting snippets. These bits were then 
reviewed, organized, and reorganized by the frst author into loose 
categories. Themes and an overall narrative developed with each 
step of the zine-making process (Figure 5). 
Zines have been a part of the creative lexicon of HCI for some 
time ([50, 89]) and although not typically used as a tool for anal-
ysis there are parallels in HCI from which this analytic method 
can build. Desjardins and Key, for example describe the iterative

process of drawing a visual taxonomy of their RtD processes as 
an integral aspect of their refective practice and analysis saying, 
“These illustrations are not meant to be decorative, or mere accom-
paniments to the text. The lines themselves are the ways by which 
we were able to make sense of our own process” [40:11]. In a similar 
manner, the iterative process of grouping content, ordering layout, 
even the choice of typeface opened space to embody, relive, and 
articulate the experiential qualities of the workshop alongside and 
in response to themes emerging from the data. This process was a 
way of tactilely making sense of the nuances, details, and contra-
dictions present amongst the many forms of data. In the sections 
below we present fndings from the analysis. 
5 TENSIONS IN POSTHUMANIST RESEARCH 
Below we present results from our critical analysis which highlights 
three tensions in posthumanist engagement aimed at unpacking 
some of the challenges, obstacles, and questions encountered by 
researchers interested in more-than-human design. Although by 
no means extensive, in foregrounding tensions with representation, 
legitimization, unseen labor, and material narratives we contribute 
to a feminist and care-ful departure from HCI’s anthropocentrism 
towards the development of more relational approaches, under-
standings, and perhaps someday, futures. 
5.1 The Representation Problem / Producing 
Legitimate Subjects of Care 
Throughout the workshop, participants were often oriented to-
wards questions of who, what, and how things got caring attention 
as a means of uncovering and refecting on the relations around 
them. Although all the participants have contributed to or engaged 
in discourses which challenge dominant and human-centered mech-
anisms of knowledge production, when it came to expressing non-
human relationships in the workshop, long standing tendencies 
towards representationalism often persisted. For example, during 
a group discussion of activity 2: Speculative Translations—DO no-
ticed that “almost half of them are speculative translations with oral 
history” (Figure 6). It is likely not the case that almost half the 
participants found language (a distinctly anthropocentric process 
of knowing and organizing) the most interesting or generative 
speculation. Yet, as Barad reminds us, representationalism is “a par-“internal” and “external” that breaks along the line of the knowing 
subject” which “is so deeply entrenched within Western culture that 
it has taken on a commonsense appeal. It seems inescapable, if not 
downright natural” [16:806]. Participants had diferent ways of un-
packing the refexive dominance of this way of understanding and 
expressing possible alternative relations as when RW discusses 
the broader colonial humanist project saying “humanism has given 
us all of this language. The project has always been to bring people 
and things into society or exclude them for society through language. ” 
Speaking specifcally from a research perspective he continues, “I 
think we run those risks when we have these kinds of encounters that 
we want to bring out. Part of this is this struggle. How do we do this 
if we have to question our epistemological approaches? Which are 
pretty deep-rooted. ” These examples reiterate some of the limits of 
epistemologies like language (specifcally English in this context) 
as it is embroiled in socio-philosophical constructs which constrain 
the ability to understand and express non-human relations or con-
ditions as they are rather than how they are represented by default 
as external rather than relational. 
In questioning the subjects and objects of caring attention, par-
ticipants not only confronted separations created through refexive 
representationalism but also how those separations structured no-
tions of deservedness. CR encountered this during activity 1: Micro-
Situations, when reenacting the ritual of applying hand cream be-
fore bed as they became aware of how easy it was to apply humanist 
values and qualities to non-humans as a byproduct of noticing. They 
explained, “When I was re-enacting that I felt quite bad. (Laughter) 
I was like, "Okay. " I had a moment of guilt, "Maybe I shouldn’t do 
this. " Also, when I was doing it a couple of times just to hear the noise 
and think about it, it’s like, "Okay, here I go giving the tube some 
human quality. Maybe I should be nicer to it. " I think that in itself 
was also interesting, to see that now me paying attention to it gave 
it such human qualities. ” The very act of attuning to the perceived 
experience of the hand cream refexively caused CR to reconsider 
that care relation based on a supposed harm—asking should I care 
diferently? And more importantly, why would I? 
This nascent question of why a non-human (like the hand cream) 
would deserve diferent treatment was the subject of further discus-
sion by another group. Because of SA’s work around prisons and 
policing, they were particularly sensitized to how political mecha-
nisms produce other humans worthy of care within these contexts, 
ticularly inconspicuous consequence of the Cartesian division between 
684
Feminist Care in the Anthropocene: Packing and Unpacking Tensions in Posthumanist HCI DIS ’22, June 13–17, 2022, Virtual Event, Australia 
sharing, “I think there’s a lot of pushback in the radical political 
circles I’m in about the language of humanizing as if somehow that 
produces a form of person that becomes palatable to people. ” SA takes 
the connection between needing to humanize (and the exclusionary 
politics therein) to build capacity to care and directs that towards 
non-humans saying, “I think I’m really curious about what tools we 
have to take these objects or forms or other living beings where they 
are. I feel like I go in circles about this all the time. How do we think 
about more-than-human or the not-human in ways that aren’t about 
humanizing them?” Critically for SA, the ‘we’ in their question 
and concern implies not only individuals but regimes of care—of 
which research collectives are very much a part. This points to 
issues beyond mere individual representationalism and highlights 
the need to look deeper at institutionalized representationalism and 
how together they produce not just subjects external to humans 
but subjects worthy of care. 
These frictions and contradictions with participants attempting 
to move beyond representationalism make clear how easy it can 
be to participate in or enable a dominant oppressive system of au-
thority (i.e., humans) to produce subjects for representation (i.e., 
non-humans). Through these subject productions with more-than-
humans, care is often contextualized as an integral ethic of ‘hu-
manity.’ This allows non-humans to fall into the same trap as other 
humans in need of “our” help, rescue, saving, or stewardship which 
are the racialized, gendered, classist etc. “politics of benevolence and 
compassion for a sufering human” [110:141]. This phenomenon 
of joining the cognates human (individual separation), humanity 
(generalized entity), and humane (moral imperative) [ibid] is at the 
crux of how care and representationalism is entangled in legitimiza-
tions of non-humans as subjects of care which further entrenches 
a subject-object divide. These examples foreground work still to 
do in fnding the mechanisms, materials, and willpower needed 
to interrogate the politics of benevolence and compassion for a 
sufering entity, or (perhaps more pointedly) non-particularized eth-
ical collectives of entities (i.e., ‘nature’ or ‘technology’). We argue 
this is critical if Euro-Western discourse hopes to move past those 
categorical representations and meet non-humans “where they are. ” 
Furthermore, taking a cue from gender theorist Judith Butler’s work 
on the production of legitimate (human) subjects beyond refexive 
actions to account for the political or manufactured [35], designers 
and researchers need to confront their own individual and system-
atic representational power and authority present from within their 
hegemonic structures (i.e., the academy). It is time to take seriously 
an attention to how such productions of subjects pre-determines 
the texture and possibilities of care relations between humans and 
non-humans. 
5.2 The Labor Problem / Labor is Progress, 
Labor is For the Living 
Because care can be described as “a cumulative efort of attentiveness 
and resilience [that] is easily overlooked” [71:2] for humans and non-
humans alike, discussion prompts for each activity often focused 
on questions of labor’s movements, visibility, and efects, especially 
as they might shift or redistribute in an alternate care relationship. 
Despite a predisposition from many of the participants towards dis-
rupting invisible labor hierarchies it took focused attention, efort, and at times a real uncomfortability to locate the labor of anything 
outside of their own human experience. For example, when SA 
was refecting on their experience producing and translating reso-
nances (from activity 1) while reenacting cleaning their glasses in 
the morning they explain, “I’m always thinking about people who 
are made invisible, whose labor is made invisible by labor conditions. 
For me, it actually felt really diferent from that to be thinking about 
the voice or the labor of the cloth which I think precisely because it’s 
not human, I think of it as just belonging to me. ” SA then refected on 
instances of material friction where non-human labor did emerge 
saying, “for me it’s recognizing that there were certain points where 
there was like a tension, like a potential snag of the material or the 
railing catching that, so at these points of resistance where I became 
aware of the labor. ” 
This susceptibility to feeling like the sole bearers of labor was 
evident in all the groups at various stages. In some instances, partic-
ipants contextualized the invisibility of more-than-human labor in 
relation to the lack of perceived progress of that labor. In the case of 
HR reenacting opening her bedroom curtain and disturbing some 
gnats she explained, “I defnitely perceived them as being disturbed 
and I guess the labor would be then to kind of achieve a homeostasis 
again. ” It took HR some time to recognize this form of non-human 
labor in part because labor is often seen as movement towards 
something as opposed to a going back, or as a focused efort to get 
somewhere new and perhaps better. Similarly, MB found himself in 
relation to a form of non-human labor closer to self-maintenance 
or persistence in the face of human intervention. When describing 
his micro-situation of reading a book, he explains, “I’m pretty rough 
on books. I like to highlight. I mean, it’s my book. I want to be able 
to engage with this book. So, it’s, kind of, warped; it defnitely had 
some use. It looks like it has been doing some labor while trying to 
withstand my engagement with it—putting up with me. ” For MB the 
non-human labor he connected to was neither progress forward nor 
movement back but a holding steady, or as RW referred to during 
the group discussion when describing a door “trying to stay as a 
door” in his 110-year-old house, “that quiet labor of trying to stay 
together. ” 
Although the previous examples of locating non-human labor 
were all discussed in the broader context of care and care relations, 
AL directly confronted the notion of labor as progress as care while 
thinking through her evolving emotional response when reenact-
ing her micro-situation—opening the front door of her house. She 
recalls, “I care for the house, but it’s not necessarily caring for me. 
And then I was thinking, that’s not fair. It cares a great deal. It’s just 
that it’s kind of quite a static form of caring. ” In the fnal group 
discussion of workshop 2, CG brings these ideas together when 
working through what it might mean to live in a world where an 
anthropocentric link between care, labor, and progress was severed 
or challenged. She wonders, “If you had to treat everything with 
a level of care that you would a human, I don’t know, I think you 
wouldn’t get very much done. Maybe that would be a good thing. ” 
CG’s provocation takes us one step further to suggest that human 
labor redirected away from a productivist frame might also be a 
form of self-care or collective care. Furthermore, her comment un-
derscores that there is no universal way to care or be in relation. 
Those are necessarily particular and treating them as such (to care 
685
DIS ’22, June 13–17, 2022, Virtual Event, Australia Cayla Key et al. 
for a door as a door rather than human) is better for both the door 
and the human. 
This section illustrates how unproductive labor by non-humans 
which might be static, non-linear, or resilient gets marginalized 
and overshadowed by “the persistence of a modern paradigm that 
associates the future with progress, with an ethico-political imperative 
to ‘advance”’ [90:693]. By shedding light on these unseen labors, we 
caught glimpses into the ways in which care relations among entan-
gled entities are similarly static, non-linear, resilient, and silenced. 
By mapping these relations through their labors, we arrived at a 
“topology that defes any suggestion of a smooth continuous manifold” 
[16:244]. Such a map highlights the agency of non-humans via their 
labor in ways which begin to resist humanization. Through the 
very process of locating these labors, participants were required to 
suspend humanist lenses which prescribe who and what has the ca-
pacity to labor in ways that were relationally particular. These acts 
of acknowledgment helped participants begin to reframe produc-
tion and progress from linear to “nonlinear enfolding[s]” [ibid:244] 
which suggests an ontologically signifcant opening. 
5.3 The Material Problem / Narratives of 
Pureness and Reconfguration 
The notion that “nothing preexists the relations that constitute it” 
[32:350] is an established ontological pillar of both care and posthu-
manist theory. As participants engaged in various forms of mate-
rial reconfguration throughout the workshops, they confronted 
long-standing narratives around what is perceived to be pure (i.e., 
preexisting relation to humans). Within these narratives are an 
unintended denial of non-human agency which exists outside of a 
human’s representation. This has the efect of saying: nothing preex-
ists the representations that constitute it—a damaging notion indeed. 
However, participants also experienced moments of reconfgura-
tion which challenged the idea that human agency is self-derived 
and exists separate from its relation. In this section we will explore 
the connections we saw between these narratives and the ways 
they directly afected matters and conditions of care. 
The phenomena of categorizing value based on material pureness 
was most present when directed at non-humans as in the case when 
AL was discussing with her smaller group why she felt a stronger 
connection and care for one item over another saying, “So I think it 
is partly because it is just the most amazing living fabric. A lot of the 
fabric that we work with is so processed that you do not get a sense of 
its relation to the original material. I mean, in cotton you can kind of 
see it a little, but for most things their nature is just so extracted. ” Al-
though her feelings and relationship to this item are more complex 
than we as deeply discussed, one element to that connection was 
the fabric’s aesthetic proximity to its unprocessed origins, or rather 
its comfortable distance from human meddling. Additionally, ro-
manticizing the material provenance of pure/impure divisions can 
produce narratives of sacrifce or sufering and therefore legitimize 
modes of care. This is a concept DO explored during the closing 
group conversation of workshop 1 when sharing why it felt easier 
to care for wood over metal: “I am wondering now too, should we 
get that for metal as well? Are we just having a missed connection 
there because we cannot see it, because we cannot see the grain of how 
we can recognize the living of the tree? I wonder if there is a blind spot . . . You know something has been given up for the metal as well, 
it is just less direct, and then we cannot empathize with it as much.” 
In her thinking, DO draws connections between pureness and care 
but also to living versus inert and suggests a danger in that blind 
spot is how it obscures those relations and limits potential forms of 
care. HR elaborates the tension between care and the fction that 
what is living has more to sacrifce as the conversation evolves, 
“I’m thinking about how a tree in its death, its materials are used to 
provide life for the other things in its ecosystem. That is a type of care 
that is contributing through its death. This is probably not the death 
that it evolved to become, the door, the spoon, the whatever. There was 
a care that it evolved to fulfll, and we took it out of that loop. ” HR’s 
refection cognizes the tree as a pure living thing with something 
akin to destiny, while recognizing “there also maybe a danger is 
romanticizing materials like that. ” 
During activity 2: Speculative Translations, participants created 
physical expressions of speculative worlds in which care conditions 
were radically diferent. Critically, these were made as situated 
human bodies—as sites of enmeshed and particular perceptual dif-
ference. Thus, in addition to the things in and around their homes, 
participants’ selves were positioned as materials to be playfully 
reconfgured. This position was often uncanny and unpleasant in 
the way it unseated a pure/reconfgured dualism for even brief 
intervals. RW describes the way he felt reconfgured during his 
speculative translation (redirecting socio-ecological oral history to 
a door hinge) saying, “I felt that I was reconfgured now as a piece 
of material, that was my fesh. Then the history of my fesh, of the 
scar, and that was no diferent, I suppose, than the wood. These things 
are taken, rendered apart, put back together . . .but I suddenly felt, 
very quickly, a kind of afnity with the things that I was literally 
physically connected to. That, I guess, is a diferent confguration that 
did not exist for me before. I never made the connection between that 
particular door and my body in that way, until this workshop. But I did 
feel like an invasive species in terms of all the care relations that are 
already in place. I felt I did not belong here. Is it a new world? Do you 
think we created new worlds?” “Yes, defnitely” (MB). “Defnitely—it 
is surprising to me that I did that, and it defnitely troubles me also” 
(AR). RW’s experience of feeling a simultaneous afnity for and 
rejection from the care relations in place among the other materials 
highlights a distinct ambivalence. From a researcher perspective, it 
is interesting and exciting to experience moments, however brief, 
of a relational ontology but there was a marked backlash as well. 
In the emergence of those worlds—those moments of heightened 
awareness of ‘being with,’ comes the uncomfortability of dimin-
ished power (agency), evoking questions of if we feel welcome 
anymore and are we ready to feel like outsiders? 
Within these various material engagements with bodies and 
things we saw how researchers grappled with a morality based 
on pureness versus reconfguration which treats entities (selves 
included) as categorical rather than particular or relational. Much 
like the ‘pristine myth’ construct of the North American wilder-
ness in Indigenous scholarship which “imagined an unopened wild 
landscape as pristine, pure, and unspoiled” [57:100] (by Indigenous 
ways of life) which was “born from the Manifest Destiny ideologies 
of western expansion” [ibid:92], this fallacy and its moral conse-
quence, is necessarily a kind of violent colonial erasure of already 
in-place and place-based relations which are undervalued because 
686

they don’t serve white anthropocentric visions of present and fu-
ture domination. This kind of political interrogation of the ‘pristine’ 
is especially needed in design research as practitioners confront the 
moral consequences of what might seem like harmless aesthetic, 
material, and narrative choices. Furthermore, when researchers 
turn the lens in on ourselves as materials like any other, susceptible 
to the same political, moral, and ontological trappings of a pure 
versus confgured dualism we are all too tempted to look away out 
of fear of our own erasure. Afterall, as feminist STS scholar Cecilia
Åsberg uncomfortably reminds, “we have never been purely human 
in the frst place ” [10:9]. 
6 DISCUSSION 
Recalling the metaphor of using this workshop to explore what we, 
as a research community, need to pack with us and unpack amongst 
us in the above sections we focused on unpacking three tensions 
with more-than-human engagement. To further trouble these ten-
sions and trace where we see them link up, the sections below 
focus on what we might pack with us ideologically and tactically 
when navigating our way forward as practitioners committed to 
posthumanist design research. 
6.1 The Knowledge–Care Loop / Towards 
Epistemological Care 
Within the tensions detailed above is the seeming inescapabilty 
of anthropocentric epistemologies to reproduce anthropocentric 
ethics and modes of care. Through our explorations of how partici-
pants related to material reconfguration and legitimizing subjects 
we begin to understand that what and how we know (epistemology) 
and what and how we care (ethics) are bound together in cycles of 
replication. By drawing a through line to seen and unseen labor as 
manifestations of uneven reciprocities we will attempt to paint a 
picture in this section of how we might attempt to know diferently 
to care diferently. 
Within posthumanist HCI there has been much attention paid to 
alternate ways of knowing, to fnding methods which push bound-
aries to encompass more-than-human voices and knowledges. How-
ever, during the fnal group discussion in workshop 1, participants 
began shifting away from trying to see through the eyes of an other 
(human or non-human) or understand their lived or even lively ex-
periences. Instead, they focused on unpacking nonrepresentational 
ways of knowing. RW suggests that “epistemological care might be 
to not know, might be to not give words to, might be to not categorize. 
There is a privileging or entitlement that we have to know, or we have 
to give it some way of knowing. Language does that. If it’s not in 
language, it doesn’t exist, or we’re not communicating. I think your 
workshop gets at this and I think there are these epistemological care 
issues ” to which HR adds “It’s interesting because this not knowing, 
it’s an important societal power mechanism to be exercised. It’s a way 
to create order. It’s a way to keep a perspective. It’s also a way to 
humble, to recognize that there are just not things that you will be 
able to understand and just lean into that and accept it and fnd other 
ways to relate to it. ” 
We further develop this idea of epistemological care frst as an 
interrogation of the knowledge-care loop, meaning we care to know 
how we know to care and second as an attempt to disrupt it. This interrogation might begin with the assumption that humans can 
only perceive of a world from the outside [ 70]. From that distance 
one must perceive of things (human and non-human) as separate, 
categorical, legitimate, and in the case of many humans—and all 
non-humans—much less agentic. This vantage point allows moral 
judgment to be administer on top of others—as is the case with an 
ethics of justice. However, there are counter proposals within Indige-
nous scholarship where thinking/knowing and therefore agency are 
not merely humanist representations overlaid on top of the world— 
as if there was a separate and solid surface upon which to place these 
‘higher level’ thoughts anyway. In her critique of Euro-Western 
onto-epistemological framing of agency, Haudenosaunee and An-
ishinaabe scholar of Indigenous Studies & Sociology Vanessa Watts 
describes ‘Place-Thought’ witch is “the non-distinctive space where 
place and thought were never separated . . .based upon the premise 
that land is alive and thinking and that humans and non-humans 
derive agency through extensions of these thoughts” [124:21]. For 
Watts, agency isn’t a given for either humans or non-humans but 
emerges out of the relations between them in a place that rejects 
human/non-human separation. When applied to an ethics of care 
this adds consequence and nuance to how knowing (or thinking) 
diferently might provide openings for caring relations to emerge 
which do not perpetuate separated, stabilized, and categorical ways 
of knowing-treating non-humans as less capable or with less ethical 
agency. 
To help concretize and articulate mechanisms which might sup-
port disrupting the knowledge-care loop a feminist care ethics 
notion of asymmetrical reciprocities might provide a tactical edge. 
In care ethics reciprocity is not necessarily symmetrical (as in ‘the 
golden rule’ do unto others as you would have them do unto you) 
which is a generalized form of justice. Rather reciprocity is seen 
as complimentary [25] or asymmetrical and particular. This makes 
obligations to co-operatively maintain a world through concrete 
acts of care labor an ethical condition of those relationships rather 
than a moral application. This is an importance distinction because 
it means that human and non-human agency is equally bound up in 
those ethical conditions, yet not equally obligated or efected. We 
saw this manifest most clearly when looking into how non-human 
labor foregrounds the linkages between agency and care (as in AL’s 
experience denying then coming to terms with how her home cares 
for her too). 
This brings us to a key point: if care ethics is a condition of 
our entangled existence, where the particularities of those relation 
(not the abstracted perceptions of humans) are what materialize 
or actualize agency for humans and non-humans then all entities 
participate (labor) in how they come to matter. As a result, we argue 
that by following care labor and linking it to asymmetrical reciproc-
ities, researchers have a concrete ‘in’ for tracing back through and 
addressing some of the ethico-onto-epistemological conditions of 
their relations in ways that interrupt the knowledge-care loop and 
perhaps begin the work of epistemological care. 
Furthermore, we argue that this form of labor tracing could be 
used to create ‘difractive’ maps of non-human relations. For Har-
away, difraction is the “mapping of interference, not of replication, 
refection, or reproduction. A difraction pattern does not map where 
diferences appear, but rather maps where the efects of diferences 
appear” [60:304]. Mapping the ’through’ with which a situated

individual is understanding non-human relations might shift fo-
cus away from the feelings or experiences of non-humans (which 
require processes of representation and legitimization through hu-
manist valuation) and turn to the interference patterns that get 
created by subject/object boundaries. Using DO’s discussion about 
the purity of wood over metal as an example, this map would not 
be an account of what we know or assume about wooden spoons. 
Rather it would trace how those particular spoons, metal, and peo-
ple are diferentiated and how that diference matters for spoons, 
metal, and people in an inspirable ethico-onto-epistemological kind 
of way. Hence, the resulting map is not ’representative’ of spoons, 
metal, or people categorically but has something to say about how 
the diference between them is produced and takes responsibility 
for how such practices come to matter. Because the labor needed to 
maintain such relationships and divisions are concrete responses 
to those diferences, we argue that visibilizing those labors difrac-
tively is one possible tactic for disrupting the knowledge-care loop. 
In this way, posthumanist epistemological care for HCI might 
entail other difractive methodologies for interrogation and disrup-
tion which seek not to replicate humanism, but which marinate in 
the unease and tensions of asymmetric reciprocities which may feel 
non-proximal, illegitimate, or lonely. Such epistemological com-
mitments could resist the urge to tame or stabilize matter and 
matterings and create openings within ourselves as knowledge 
producers to rework those boundaries—a prospect which may be 
scary or unsustainable yet none the less is our responsibility. 
6.2 Where is the Risk? / Towards a Diferent 
Kind of Imagining 
Throughout the two workshops participants oscillated between 
enacting a morality based on categorical entities which are com-
fortably sperate to rejecting those categories and dualisms based 
on particular and embodied relations which were uncomfortably 
close. These encounters were marked by feelings of alienation, re-
jection, and being uncared for. As AB put it during her group’s 
discussion of activity 1, “I felt like I was interrupting their conference. ” 
While exploring the romantic materiality of subject/object cuts it 
became clear that although those categories and dualisms are not 
absolutes, they possess a haunting aesthetic capacity to marginalize 
non-humans and humans alike. 
As designers, makers, or creators of knowledge objects (con-
structed from an array of diferent materialities) we hold and have 
claimed some say in that aesthetic. And as researchers committed 
to posthumanist agendas we are necessarily working with a specu-
lative aesthetic because imagining how else we might live in worlds 
“as well as possible” means trekking through relations not yet made 
or unmade. Therefore, it is worth considering how the origins and 
functions of speculation are more complex than they might seem 
and, as we will attempt to unpack here, there is a real risk in our 
speculations not being risky enough. For philosopher and social 
theorist Michael Halewood, ‘successful’ situated speculation “re-
nounces any faith in a settled world that can be immediately known. 
Instead, it launches itself from, and returns to a world-in-the-making, 
where one’s speculations can only be assessed in terms of the efects 
and consequences that they produce as part of the making of the 
world” [58:60]. Building of Alfred Whitehead, this is an important distinction as it separates productive speculation from idle imagi-
nation [125]. For Halewood and Whitehead, to speculate is not just 
to imagine a move but to make a move through the speculating of 
it. 
This idea is not new however, and an imaginative landscape can 
be productively thickened through Indigenous Ecological Knowl-
edge. According to Haudenosaunee scholars of Indigenous Envi-
ronmental Studies Joe Sheridan and Dan Longboat, “Imagination, in 
its ecological sense, is the cognitive and spiritual condition of entwin-
ing with local and cosmological intelligences. Indeed, imagination is 
the spiritual medium of those powers that engage humans without 
humans being the prime movers of the act” [101:370]. Although imag-
ination in an Indigenous ecological sense and situated speculation 
share the belief that speculation is not an external doing to a world 
but rather an act of the world—a medium of its co-becoming—the 
two philosophies difer on what it means to a take a risk through 
that act. For Halewood the risk is twofold, it is in the uncertainty 
of where one will end up as the result of a speculation (because 
worlds are not fxed) and the socio-political consequences therein 
(i.e., ridicule from within the academy). For Sheridan and Long-
boat however, the consequences are much deeper. They explain, 
“From a Haudenosaunee or Mohawk perspective, we notice that minds 
colonized by these assertions concerning the universality of imagi-
nation’s origins and functions are contributing dimensions to larger 
conceits maintained by anthropocentrically biased cultures. Cultures 
colonized by these conceits tautologically confrm the interior sources 
of their intelligence” [101:366]. In the context of imagining (here the 
paper will shift terms to bring the following ideas into alignment 
with Sheridan and Longboat’s more consequential formulation) 
for more-than-human centered design futures, the risk of avoiding 
methodologies because they make us (Euro-Western researchers 
and participants) feel uneasy, uncomfortable, unwelcome, uncared 
for, or shut out roots the very subject/object dualism and human 
exceptionalism we are trying to speculate ourselves out of. This is 
an important distinction as it asserts that risk does not rest solely 
on the shoulders of a human speculator but that imaginative risk 
scales to the cosmological as a real and inseparable material of an 
entwined world. 
In closing his essay on situated speculation Halewood concludes 
that ‘successful’ situated speculation is rare and very challenging 
to achieve. In analyzing the Alternative Translations Workshop 
against Halewood’s notion of success as making a real move from 
a situated place to one which is unknowable, and which produces 
consequences and Sheridan and Longboat’s element of risk to hu-
man self-perception, we realized instances of ‘success’ lay precisely 
in the moments where participants felt the most physically and 
emotionally troubled as they challenged perceived contaminants 
through embodying thresholds. This was the case when RW re-
confgured his body as a door hinge and felt, but also afected, the 
boundaries between himself and those other materials. In that act 
of imagining he challenged the perceived containments of human 
and non-human ‘successfully.’ In the case of GB explaining to the 
group her process of imagining alternate care relations with her 
wall and foor (per activity 2) she begins by describing her daily 
handstand practice saying, “it’s a very embodied experience, because 
your entire weight is on your arms, which is not something that we’re 
688

used to, as humans, so you’re really focused on your embodied ex-
perience of the handstand, and you’re really fghting yourself, too. ” 
GB used the physicality of her connection with the foor and of her 
own bodily resistance to this reconfguration as starting points for 
reimagining what at frst seemed like the “passive work of the foor” 
saying “I came to realize that we both change, that I change with 
them, and that stability isn’t fxed but relational, not rigid but a dance 
of trust between bodies. ” For GB, embodying and fghting through 
thresholds of trust, stability, and autonomy within herself and the 
two surfaces allowed her to imagine/realize their relationship as 
more fuid—as something choreographed yet co-created. 
The tactic of fnding thresholds within a relationship and em-
bodying them, making them something humans must feel and 
physically or emotionally endure also resonates with Sheridan 
and Longboat’s understanding of imagination: “Like everything 
Haudenosaunee, imagination has a place because imagination is a 
place , and because everything is connected to everything else, the en-
counter with imagination is a living communication within a sentient 
landscape” (original emphasis) [101:369]. Simply put, imagination 
is not thinking diferently but being diferently because it is a part 
of our daily worlding practices. This last point underscores why 
HCI and design research needs to take speculation more seriously 
and why imagining should/does not solely reside in our minds. 
In some ways this is quite intuitive for a design audience yet as 
designers and researchers we are materials to be imagined as well 
and stand to beneft the most from these kinds of uncomfortable re-
confgurations as we hold the potential to transfer that imaginative 
aesthetic through our research materials. After all, “Imagination did 
not become a quality of a singularly human mind until mind severed 
itself from landscape and the depths of time. For the Haudenosaunee, 
imagination possesses no prehistory. Imagination became something 
other than what it is when mind went solo into Cartesian waters 
and lost sight of mythological shores” [101:370]. HCI cannot run the 
risk of speculating more-than-human worlds from disembodied 
subject minds and needs to relocate critical practices of imagining 
back within landscapes and specifcally between the boundaries or 
cuts which severed the two in the frst place. Without these truly 
messy methods, design and research runs the risk of once again 
displacing the same elsewhere [15] from a position of nowhere [59]. 
As AT nicely surmised during workshop two’s closing discussion, 
“As there is with decay and these remixing, and these messy moments, 
I think they’re not romantic. Even though I think we kind of want 
them to be. ” 
7 CONCLUSION 
Although care can be described as a “form of political imagination to 
fuel hope and desire for transformative action” [110:137], relational 
ethics (like care ethics) are not an ideal, not an innocent, not a 
utopia. They are not safe, moral, or stable either. This paper reports 
on the analysis from a workshop which applied such an uneasy 
relational understanding of ethics to reveal and unravel tensions 
within posthumanist research practice but also to fuel a transforma-
tion of how design researchers might imagine and act diferently 
within those practices. We have argued that is time to take seri-
ously an attention to how subjects and objects are produced and to 
how those mechanisms of production shape the capacities of care relations between humans and non-humans. This paper unpacks 
tensions within posthumanist design and research regarding repre-
sentationalism, legitimization, unseen labor, and dualistic material 
narratives. Along the way we have left markers or cairns—small 
piles of stones delicately balanced atop one another to show how 
one has proceeded along a path which is unclear. It is our hope that 
these metaphorical cairns might contribute to orienting posthuman-
ist design within feminist and Indigenous praxis through conveying 
their ability to highlight the thickness of our present and to thicken 
our futures because both make sense of being on earth as a neces-
sarily interdependent and relational practice of maintenance rather 
than domination. 
Although we have taken care to extract these tensions and re-
sponses, we recognize that engaging issues as deeply rooted as how 
to de-center design will likely not result in clear-cut directions or 
enunciations. We take to heart Puig de la Bellacasa’s afrmation that 
speculative ethics cannot be a sanctuary for its positions and as a 
practice must stay “aware and appreciative of the vulnerability of any 
position on the ‘as well as possible”’ [91:7]. We admit to providing no 
‘answers’ but believe that our process of investigating and respond-
ing matters more. In the words of Red River Métis/Michif scholar 
of STS Max Liboiron: “methodologies—whether scientifc, readerly, 
or otherwise—are always already part of Land relations and thus are 
a key site in which to enact good relations (sometimes called ethics)” 
[74:7]. Where we have arrived is the result of a series of difractive 
‘readings’ built atop and throughout each other, beginning with 
how the workshop was conceived and curated, to the happenings 
which took place therein, and in the analysis presented here. This is 
not to say that if practitioners construct their research from messy 
difractive methodologies, they are not accountable for their con-
tributing outcomes. Rather, this underscores the importance and 
ethics of the journey not over but alongside the destination because 
we too are reconfgurable through our praxis in ways possibly more 
consequential than any other.

APPENDIX 
This appendix is meant to provide a brief introduction to each 
participant researcher and pointers to key publications or projects 
which are by no means exhaustive, but which help situate the 
starting points of each individual’s research interests. 
Workshop 1 
Doenja Oogjes, a design researcher and PhD candidate in the 
School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser Univer-
sity uses postphenomenology to move beyond human-centeredness 
to explore more-than-human design practices [63] and relations 
with things often utilizing thing-perspectives [88]. Dr. Ann Light is 
a researcher in the School of Engineering and Informatics at the 
University of Sussex and the School of Arts and Communication 
at Malmö University. Her work critically investigates and troubles 
design through axes of gender [75, 79], ethico-political care [77, 78], 
sustainability [76, 103], the anthropocene [80], and collaborative 
more-than-human future making [ 6]. Dr. Shana Agid is an artist, 
design researcher, activist, and Dean of the School of Art, Media and 
Technology at the Parsons School of Design whose work engages 
design and participation [4] across dimensions of care [1] ethics [3] 
politics [2] and geography and infrastructure via queer experience 
[9]. Dr. Holly Robbins, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department 
of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology, 
explores posthuman design for transitions to renewable energies 
[93]. Dr. Tammy Shel is a feminist philosopher and care ethicists 
who uses care ethics to advance pedagogical methods and theory 
[99, 100]. Michael Beach, a PhD student and researcher in the Col-
lege of Engineering at the University of Washington, has facilitated 
research on the UX of climate change [21], and has used posthu-
manist theory to facilitate and design a collection of design fctions Cayla Key et al. 
or multispecies care and collaborative survival [22]. Dr. Anuradha 
Venugopal Reddy, a postdoctoral design researcher in the School
of Arts and Communication at Malmö University, explores tech-
nological interventions such as AI and CA’s from a non-human 
perspective to reimagine more-than-human approaches to ethics 
[87] and agency [92]. Dr. Ron Wakkary is a design researcher in 
the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser Uni-
versity and the Chair of Design for More Than Human-Centered 
Worlds at Eindhoven University of Technology. His work explores 
thing-centered design [120, 122, 123], posthumanist reconsidera-
tions of design epistemology [117], and how posthumanist design 
(informed by care theory) might decenter humans to enable multi-
ple and diverse worlds [118, 121], as well as sustainability in design 
more specifcally [119]. Neilly Herrera Tan is a PhD student and 
researcher in the College of Engineering at the University of Wash-
ington who uses speculative design to investigate relationships 
with power and privacy via smart home cameras [108]. 
Workshop 2 
Dr. Alex Taylor at the Centre for Human Computer Interaction 
Design, at City, University of London is an researcher who has 
used feminist new materialist relational ontologies to de-center 
human for alternative food futures [65], to explore re-orientations 
to design which expand human / non-human relations [109], and 
feminist care theory to challenge AI and Assistive Technology [26]. 
Dr. Tyler Fox, an artist and researcher in the Department of Human 
Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington, 
uses posthumanism, relational ontology, technology, and integrated 
non-humans as part of an art practice which creates shared experi-
ence between humans and nonhumans highlighting their relations 
[51]. Dr. Austin Toombs is an HCI researcher at Purdue University 
who has argued for the integration of a feminist care ethics perspec-
tive in HCI to attend to and problematize care entanglements with 
researcher relationships [115], technology mediated community 
spaces [113], gendered labour division [20], and gig economy labor 
practices and technologies [114]. Armi Behzad, a Ph.D. student and 
design researcher at the School of Interactive Arts and Technol-
ogy at Simon Fraser University is interested in human-technology 
relations [121]. Dr. Audrey Desjardins, a design researcher in the 
School of Art + Art History + Design at the University of Wash-
ington, uses feminist methods to reimagine everyday encounters 
with things [41], explores human-data relationships as having an 
agentic materiality [39, 42], and to deeply investigate the role of 
designer and thing as co-constituting and co-confgured [43]. Cas-
sidy is a creative technologist and researcher at a UK university 
where they use intersectional feminism and queer studies to ground 
explorations in self-care technologies. Gabrielle Benabdallah is a 
PhD student, artist, and researcher in the department of Human 
Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington 
who explores the relationships between humans, technology, lan-
guage, and creativity. Dr. Cally Gatehouse is a feminist designer 
and researcher in the School of Design at Northumbria University 
with an interest in distinctive kinds of knowledge design can pro-
duce and how that can help designers, researchers and citizens to 
navigate and understand a world shaped by network technology 
[53, 54, 56].
