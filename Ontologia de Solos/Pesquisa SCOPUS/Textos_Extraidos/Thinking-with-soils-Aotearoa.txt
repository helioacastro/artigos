In this commentary, we reflect on our work with an urban youth farm where
young people (re)connect to the food sys tem. Participating in everyday soil
creation and care activities nurtured n ew relationships with more-than-human
ecologies and beings at an urban farm calle d Cultivate Christchurch. In this farm,
participants engaged with soils and the process of making and regenerating soil
from food waste via composting. We ask whether such activities can begin to
help participants think with soil rather than about it, and to heal the ‘metabolic
rift ’, the socioecological disconnect from food growing and nutrient cycles.

1|INTRODUCTION
In this commentary, we reflect on our work with an
urban youth farm in /C22Otautahi Christchurch, where
young people (re)connect to the food system through
participating in everyday embodied activities of caringfor soil. As participants in everyday activities such ascollecting waste, making compost, cleaning bins, grow-
ing, washing, distributing and eating produce, we were
able to ‘think with ’soil and ‘become with ’more-
than-human ecologies in the urban farm. ‘Thinking
with soil ’is a term inviting us to change our thinking
around soils: moving from linear, productivist under-standings of soils as lifeless media to socioecological

than-human communities (Puig de la Bellacasa,
2017 ;
Salazar et al., 2020 ). Understanding soils in this way
enacts a soil care, which, we argue, has the capacity
to begin healing the rupture that occurred in the‘metabolic rift ’, when nutrient cycling between town
and city was ruptured under globalised industrial
agriculture and when generations of humans became
disconnected from food growing and nutrient cycles(Schneider & McMichael,
2010 ). We finish with some
thoughts on the temporality of ‘thinking with soils ’.
2|METABOLIC RIFTS IN THE
21ST CENTURY
Aotearoa New Zealand residents are becoming increas-
ingly urbanised and spending more and more time in
built environments (Holland et al., 2021; Laird &
McFarland, 2014; Wilkinson et al., 2021). An increasingly
urbanised population becomes increasingly disconnected
from their food's origins in the land and sea, and also dis-connected from the harmful environmental conse-
quences of their food supply networks in places both
near and far (Barthel et al.,
2019). Food systems theorists
use the notion of ‘metabolic rift ’to think about the
disconnect between urban and rural. Schneider and
McMichael trace this concept to Karl Marx, who pointedto ‘both a rupture in nutrient cycling between town
and country and a rupture in the metabolic relation between
humans and nature under capitalism ’(Schneider &
McMichael,
2010, p. 462). This speaks not only to the lossReceived: 27 June 2023 Accepted: 29 June 2023

of agricultural knowledge within urban spaces, but the
wider loss of other forms of exchange between humansand nature, including food gathering, hunting, gleaning
and using commons, where a relatively close or tight
‘circular economy ’of production and waste was
retained. The metabolic rift informs us of absences both
material and relational.
The material aspect of the rift is the very real geo-
graphical break in nutrient cycling, whereby the urban
population consumes the products of rural agriculture,
without returning the ‘waste ’to the soil from which it
was grown (Dehaene et al.,
2016). This rupture in nutri-
ent cycling creates an opening for commercialised fertili-
ser products to top up the soil nutrients extracted by the
vast amount of food exported from rural to urban. This isnot innately related to urban and rural material flows,
however, since China's early urbanisation included systems
for transporting both food waste and ‘night-soil ’from cities
back to rural areas to be returned to the soil (Yu,
2010).
The material and nutrient side of the metabolic rift is exac-
erbated by the homogenisation of food crops and the colo-nisation of particular kinds of foods (plants and animals)
into environments that do not e asily support their nutrient
requirements. For example, New Zealand began importingsuperphosphate in 1867 in the form of guano from thePacific Islands, and began manufacturing it in 1881. This
displaced traditional m /C22ara kai and mahinga kai activities
and supported settler-led expansion of dairy, sheep andbeef farming in this country.
1
New Zealand's farming sector has long been export-
oriented, meaning that the rift between ‘town and coun-
try’is a vast rift of millions of kilometres between food
growing regions of New Zealand and food purchasers
abroad. In New Zealand, our food waste is still ending upin landfill, where it cannot decompose easily and contrib-utes to greenhouse gases (Office of the Prime Minister's
Chief Science Advisor,
2022), and our bodily waste is
flushed away ‘we know not where ’(Hawkins, 2006),
with millions of litres of drinkable water. This is the dis-
connected nutrient cycle that the metabolic rift refers to.
The relational aspect of the metabolic rift is inter-
twined with the material one, but implies a further
disconnect: the separation of humans (in this case, urban
residents) from the natural systems that sustain their lives.There are often global separations between production
and consumption processes and the ecological systems
that support them. These are all social as well as ecologicalproblems. The kinds of infrastructures that separate usfrom the cycling of organic waste/nutrients produce a par-
ticular kind of waste subjectivity (Diprose et al.,
2023). The
kind of thinking that focuses on separations, categories,hierarchies and classifications both emerges from and con-
tributes to forms of relational metabolic rift.3|CARE AND RELATIONSHIP IN
HEALING THE RIFT
In Aotearoa and elsewhere, scholars have been drawing on
Indigenous research and worldviews for inspiration inrepairing this disconnect. As Indigenous scholar Sherri
Mitchell (Weh'na Ha'mu Kwasset, Penawahpskek Nation)
notes, science is finally coming to see that her people's‘kinship teachings were more than fanciful fiction ’,a n d
experts are pointing to Indigenous ecological knowledge as
being key in addressing the multiple ecological system col-lapses we face in our time (Mitchell,
2020,p p .3 6 –37). For
Jess Hutchings (Ng /C22ai Tahu) and colleagues, there is a rela-
tionship with soil evidenced in the whakapapa connecting
soil to tangata whenua in Aotearoa New Zealand. Thisrelationality leads to kaitiakitanga as a form of care for and
with nonhuman kin, and a consideration of relationships
‘ki uta ki tai ’, from the mountains to the sea (Hutchings
et al.,
2018). This relationality is two-way: ‘while the
resources sustain us as a people they also need to be sus-
tained by the people ’(Roskruge, 2007, cited in Hutchings
et al., 2018, p. 94). Acts of care, then, are implied in Te Ao
M/C22aori thinking on relationality, as they are in thinking
arising from non-Indigenous feminist social studies of soilscience, such as the work of Maria Puig de laBellacasa (
2012,2017)a n dY e ea n dS h a r p( 2023).
In contrast to disconnected relationalities with soils,
Puig de la Bellacasa proposes a relationality with soils thatis non-productivist. She identifies that one of the conse-
quences of the relational rift is the productivist manage-
ment of soil, which prioritises maximum output from thesoil with targeted inputs. She critiques this kind of produc-
tivist relationship with soil as a further extractive practice
that does not acknowledge the community of soil in and ofitself without humans, or the different kinds of timescalesthat complex soil communities are embedded in outside
the productivist cycles of crops. She asks us to ‘think with ’
soils, to think with their temporalities, and to engage withsoils through touch. For Neera Singh working with people
in the Odisha forests in India, community acts of care and
spending time in the forest together renewed and nurturedcollective and connected ‘co-becomings ’with more-
than-human communities (Singh,
2017). For Singh, this is
not about ‘displacing the human ’, as some critics of the
‘nonhuman turn ’have supposed, but is about displacing
‘Eurocentric, modern, capitalist conceptions of the human
to allow other ways of being human to flourish ’,w h e r e
‘vitalist ontologies in conjunction with Indigenous insights
/C1/C1/C1offer possibilities for a pluriversal, postcapitalist world ’
(Singh, 2022, p. 85, see also Escobar, 2018;Y e e&
Sharp, 2023).
Our ethnographic research work in recent years has
explored such touch-based relationships with soils and128 COMMENTARY

other more-than-human ecological communities in an
urban farm in /C22Otautahi Christchurch. At the time of
research, Cultivate Christchurch was an urban farm and
charitable trust that took in paid and unpaid interns for
3–6 month periods, while also providing inner city food
waste collection and restaurant quality vegetables for
sale. Kelly was part of a research team in 2017 and 2018
that conducted fieldwork with Cultivate,2while Sasha
did fieldwork in 2020 as part of his thesis. We both
noticed the healing nature of relationships within more-
than-human places and ecologies for young people whohad previously been disconnected from both nutrientcycles and relationships with the environment: Kelly's
team focused mainly on the belonging in community
and physical activity of gardening and care work(Dombroski,
2020 ), and Sasha's work focused on rela-
tionships with soil and other nonhuman actors in the
space (Goburdhone, 2021). Kelly's work concentrated on
understanding how Cultivate understood their values and
outcomes for their work with an awareness of hybrid
more-than-human collectives where more-than-humanincludes more than just those non-human actors consid-
ered ‘animate ’(Whatmore,
2002), such as place (Larsen &
Johnson, 2017). Sasha's work was a multispecies ethnogra-
phy using relational perspectives that highlighted theinterdependence of human and non-human lives as mean-
ingfully intersecting through ‘ecological relations, political
economy, and cultural representation ’(Locke &
Munster,
2015, p. 1). Recently, we have thought about
what our work might mean for ‘healing ’the metabolic rift
(see Clausen et al., 2015).
4|THINKING WITH SOILS IN
AOTEAROA
At Cultivate, we noted two kinds of activities that worked
to restore relationships between humans and soils in par-ticular. The first was touching and interacting with the
soil. The second was embodied cognition —a thinking
with the soil.
For youth interns (and us) on the farm, interacting
with soil might involve shovelling large loads of mulch
and food waste in a layered ‘lasagne ’of compost. They
actively engaged in vigorous and creative interactions
with potential soil —being part of the birth, regeneration
and care of soil in many ways (observations and inter-views with Kelly, 2018). It might also involve cleaningout bins with rotted food waste and burying food waste
in the soil or putting it in worm farms to further digest.
For staff and interns who had been there longer, therewas a deeper attentiveness to what soil itself was saying,
as one person related:I part it with my hands a bit, ‘cause you
wanna see your depth. The water here gets
radiated by the sun, evaporated, the windcomes in, sucks the top layer off /C1/C1/C1if you're
putting your hand in and you're hands aren't
dirty, then it's pretty dry. And it's not just thelooking at the soil, you're looking at yourhand and how it is affected I guess. Like, the
response of the soil particles to your hand.
(Interview with Sasha, 2020)
Attentiveness to soils at this time is critically important: a
third of the world's productive soils are already degraded,
with over 90% on a pathway to degradation by 2050
(FAO,
2021 ). This is important for humans because
95% of the food we eat comes from the soil (FAO, 2021 ).
But as Krzywoszynska ( 2019 )n o t e s ,i nm a n yi n d u s t r i e s ,
a productivist attentiveness to soil is mainly aboutstabilising nutrient extraction from soils by chemical
replacements. This has detrimental long-term effects
on soil biota. The kind of attentiveness that focuseson the already-present ecological communities that
make up soils —which Cultivate encourages —invites a
different kind of caring relationship with soils (seeKrzywoszynska & Marchesi,
2020 ).
As Puig de la Bellacasa proposes, it is not enough
to just care about soils or care forsoils, but it is necessary
to care with soils and all their attendant needs and con-
cerns that might not fully coincide with our productivist
temporalities. As humans, we can only do this through
our ‘impure entanglements rather than an enlightened
distance ’(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017, p. 133) —through
getting involved in a caring mutual relationship with
soils (see also Yee & Sharp, 2023). At Cultivate, this
‘thinking with ’soils is expressed relationally as a life
cycle to be honoured:
Compost to me is the perfect example of a
truly cyclical nature, because we're getting
stuff that essentially people don't want and
they're throwing away, which, there is noaway, like, that's not a place that exists. So
by taking that and by actually honouring
that cycle and bringing it back in again togrow that food, we're like showing people
the cyclical nature of existence on this planet
(Interview with Sasha, 2020).
Learning from the embodied and ‘haptic ’relationships
with soils, then, involves a shift from body to cognition:
the knowledge of the mundane activities of care forcompost and attentiveness to soil structure through touch
becoming coherent thoughts about and with compostCOMMENTARY 129

and soil, thoughts that have developed through attunement
to soils (see also Siimes, 2023 and his description of
knowing wine in this issue).
What does all this mean for thinking around meta-
bolic rift in urban spaces? Does this attentiveness andinteraction with soil necessarily lead to new ways of
thinking and being with the environment? We cannot
make that claim for this short commentary based on ourwork with Cultivate. But what we can say is that as with
any relationship, it develops through time spent together
(as many of the articles in this special issue demonstrate;see particularly the comments in Weber & Barron,
2023).
Here, another kind of temporality comes into play: the
urgency of soil care, the climate crisis, food security and
soil loss through erosion and disastrous floods like thoseAotearoa has experienced in 2023. This urgency must be
matched with a relationality and an attentiveness to soil
temporalities that do not match productivist timeframes.We observed and participated in an urban farm that
worked both within and against productivist temporali-
ties to relate to soil, provide food urgently for communi-ties (Dombroski et al.,
2020), and to learn new ways of
being together with soil and plants (Dombroski
et al., 2023; Goburdhone, 2021). Healing the metabolic
rift cannot be rushed, but urban farms can enable us toattend to it through teaching more of us how to ‘think
with ’soils as interdependent more-than-human commu-
nities with temporalities that challenge urban materialand relational experiences.
