Received: 6 February 2023  
Accepted: 15 March 2023  The highest challenge humankind is facing in the current time period is the enormous 
population growth and the need to meet the food and nutrient to the population. To meet the 
enormous production, the farmers are more relayed on the usage of chemicals to increase 
the food production during the cultivation process. Inclination towards chemical fertilizers 
is because of their popularity and availability , the over usage of these chemicals is a root 
cause of many major problems like nutrient -less crops, soil quality degradation, and 
environmental hazards in the long run. The availability of a knowledge base of the soil 
quality parameters and their related organic fertilizers according to the farmer’s region can 
decrease the inclination towards the utilization of chemical fertilizers and adopt the usage 
of organic fertilizers. To help in this process of a major change in farming we built an 
ontology oriented  deep learning model which recommends the farmers in choosing the best 
organic fertilizers based on the soil quality. The domain ontology construction for 
agriculture is based on semantic language which can be reused in the future. The knowledge 
base is th en utilized by the deep learning model to process the data and recommend the best 
suitable fertilizers.  Keywords:

1.INTRODUCTION
India is well known for its diversified agricultural crops and 
their practices. Agriculture is called the backbone occupation 
of India contributing 70% of the population employed in 
agriculture. India is the fastest developing country, agriculture 
plays a very prominent role in devel opment, employment, and 
source of raw materials which directly affects the economic 
growth of India helping the growth of GDP predominantly [1]. 
Indian agriculture is the most diversified field. The cultivation 
culture varies from geographical regions, his torical practices, 
soil diversity, seasonal changes, the demand for the crop and 
many more factors [2].  
With the rapid growth of population sufficient food 
production to meet the growth plays a challenge with the 
minimum amount of cultivation land availabl e with the cause 
of development. This scenario is not just a part of India it’s a 
challenge faced by the world. To reach the maximum yield 
unscientific methodologies, inorganic fertilizers and pesticides 
are used to the maximum extent. The unethical usage of 
inorganic fertilizers has degraded the nutrient value of soil 
which makes the cultivation land non -reusable and also 
inefficient in producing a nutritious yield. It's high time to 
orient towards saving the limited cultivation land by adopting 
organic fe rtilizers in the cultivation practices [3]. Adopting 
organic fertilization helps maintain the nutrient of soil helping 
in sustainable agriculture. Soil quality is measured on the basis 
of chemical properties, soil is tested for PH, Nitrogen, 
Phosphorus, Ni trogen and Potassium to evaluate the quality 
and the stage at which the soil needs to be treated to get a good 
yield [4].  Agriculture practices are widely a diverse field when it 
comes to India [5]. The agriculture demands, seasons, 
environment, methodolog y adopted by each farmer, 
fertilization technique, culture is widely diverse and has multi 
dimensions to it. It is also evident that acquiring information 
related to agriculture is a very tedious task. The farmers have 
limited access to knowledge related t o the type of crop that can 
be cultivated, fertilization technique, price variation, and 
policies available to them. As the diversity increases having a 
default knowledge accumulation technique with a simple 
database is not an efficient way to retrieve the  information.  
In this paper, we are trying to address the two main 
problems in agriculture. Firstly, having a domain knowledge 
of agriculture which is related to a specific geographical region 
with all the relevant information needed for cultivation. 
Secon dly, building a recommender system for organic 
fertilizers using deep learning.  
An ontology is a direct approach to managing complex 
agricultural data and their dimensions effectively. Ontology is 
nothing but a generalized format for representing knowledge  
[6]. As we have already observed the dependency present 
between various domains in agriculture will help the farmers 
in sustainable agriculture ontologies can actually provide 
interoperability between the domains and establish a better 
understanding of th e domain [7]. Extensively generalizing an 
ontology: they define the entities, domains and attributes that 
are present in the domain and make it accessible to a machine -
interpretable format [6].  
Deep learning is an extension of machine learning. Deep 
learning is very popular as it can address complex problems

 effectively with a minimum amount of time [8]. Deep learning 
has a promising result with its adopting nature in solving any 
kind of data lik e images, sound, and natural languages with 
good results. Leveraging these advantages of deep learning in 
a complex domain of agriculture a promising system can be 
built. When the knowledge base of the domain is present in a 
machine -interpretable format, u tilizing the information related 
to fertilizers and soil a deep learning model is built to 
recommend the organic fertilizers to the farmers handily 
which encourages and helps the farmers in achieving a 
sustainable agriculture practice benefiting soil to ma intain its 
nutrient value and helping it to rejuvenate.  
 
 
2. OVERVIEW AND SURVEY  
 
Ontology act as a medium to explain the domain. By acting 
as a medium, they explain the domain formally, explicitly 
specifying the sharable information of the domain. This 
prope rty of ontology solves information sharing between 
different fields. Ontology also facilitates to access the 
knowledge base in a machine -readable format. They also act 
as a backbone for semantic web where the semantic web acts 
as a retrieval platform for t he complex data.  
The development of a knowledge base helps in cooperative 
knowledge sharing among all the dependencies of agriculture 
by which ontology can also act as a search engine for 
knowledge retrieval [9]. A study was conducted in Thailand 
on Rice disease identification and control recommendation to 
farmers by building a domain ontology and was evaluated with 
different stakeholders in addressing the queries related to rice 
crop disease. With this research, they filled the gap that existed 
between th e knowledgebase of ontology and semantic 
technologies [10]. To fill the gap that exists in searching for 
the kind of diseases utilizing the capacity of a semantic method 
with the help of OWL (Web ontology language) was 
developed and using queries diseases were retrieved [11]. Sri 
Lankan research found the problem related to agricultural 
information and utilized ontology by creating SPARQL as an 
endpoint for retrieval of information, they built a domain 
ontology that is a user -centric agricultural knowledge 
repository system. The system they built can be used in 
different ways like reusing, extending, modifying and pruning 
[12]. Well -maintained practices in agriculture are maintained 
or acknowledged and shared for the betterment of agricultural 
practices [13] . A domain ontology named agricultural online 
service was developed by keeping knowledge sharing as the 
main idea of agriculture which supported a multi -linguistic 
approach [14]. This research showcases the capacity of the 
relationship property of ontology . A knowledge management 
system for agriculture particularly for a wheat crop a novel 
approach that oracle supports RDF (Resource description 
framework) and OWL to present meaningful knowledge to the 
usage. The average rating provided by the expert by eval uating 
the ontology model vs the traditional knowledge management 
model is very much greater in comparison with the knowledge 
model [13].  
Deep learning is an advance of machine learning. Deep 
learning algorithms are conceptualized on the basis of the 
human  brain [15]. They have evidently performed and 
produced outstanding results. Deep learning uses multi -layer, 
layer -to-layer interconnection to address complex problems by 
learning the training and target even in an unsupervised and 
complex dataset. The mai n aim of deep learning is to 
understand the data feature from the lower level and then form a higher -level dimensionality abstraction of the feature 
semantically to rule out the manual effort to make the complex 
data into a machine -feedable form.  
Leveragin g machine learning techniques can be extensively 
seen in building recommender systems. We would like to brief 
a few of them in the below Table 1 as they form a strong base 
for improvising the recommendation systems. With this study, 
we can conclude that th e prediction of disease, crop or 
fertilizer has been reproduced effectively but the efficiency, 
time, robustness, and adaptability of the system to dynamic 
changes when it comes to rigorous change of the aspects can 
be handled with the adoption of building  recommender system 
with deep learning techniques.  
 
Table 1 . Machine learning algorithm discussion  
 
Algorithm used for 
recommender 
system  Outcome  
Random forest  They have made a complete survey of the 
implementations made by adopting a 
machine -learning random forest 
algorithm to predict pesticides and 
fertilizers by involving the methodology 
of text processing. They discuss the 
outcomes produced by them in detail and 
proofs that the machine learning 
algorithm is efficient enough to make the 
recommendations [16].  
K-NN, Random 
Forest, Gradient 
boosted decision 
tree, Regularized 
greedy forest.  An overall effort was made to build a 
recommendation system that predicts 
yield and also disease detection. The 
overall system helped in many ways by  
predicting the market price, suggesting 
the best crop to opt for, suggesting the 
optimum date for cultivation, evaluating 
demand and supply, weed detection, and 
fertilizer prediction. The system 
concentrated the overall picture of 
agriculture practices [1 7]. 
Regression 
algorithms (Support 
vector regression, 
Polynomial 
regression, Linear 
regression, Random 
Forest)  Using majority voting by combining the 
best algorithms they have built a yield 
recommendation system based on the 
crop by considering geographical region, 
soil chemical properties, and weather 
data. They have increased the accuracy to 
94% than the previous methodologies 
used [18].  
SVM Classification, 
Decision Tree  They built a system to recommend pest 
control based on the crop. They hav e 
considered almost all crops into 
consideration to predict the pest. The 
model shows SVM has outperformed 
with 89% accuracy than the rest of the 
algorithms [19].  
 
Recommender Systems work based on defending the over -
flooded information against customized information 
considering the user choice, and personalization [20, 21]. This 
makes the user experience more meaningful. The advances in 
deep learning, has made a remarkable change in the 
architecture of the recommender system by providing statefu l 
results. Deep learning has also helped in improvising the 
performance measure of the recommender system [22]. Deep 
learning can capture linear which is user preference and also 
non-linear which is not a user preference and do the 
recommendation [23, 24].  It is also able to capture the intricate 
relationship between all the data sources like text, contextual 
462
 and visual [22]. There are many who has built a system to 
recommend features like pest control based on the crop. They 
have considered almost all crop s into consideration to predict 
the pest. Considering a model built on SVM has outperformed 
with 89% accuracy than the rest of the algorithms [19].  
There are three types of recommender system:  
Content -based recommender system: They work based on 
past revie ws, likes or dislikes given by the user by considering 
the explorative characters of the item and then recommending 
a new item/user [22, 23].  
Collaborative recommender system: They recommend the 
item by considering the inclination of the current user with 
other user likes and dislikes [22, 23].  
Hybrid recommender system: Hybrids are divided into three 
types. Monolithic, parallel and pipeline recommender. 
Monolithic leverages the integration of several recommender 
systems and then integrates them into one. T he other two 
require two strategies of the recommender to combine and 
produce the recommendation [22, 23].  
Utilization of the above -mentioned recommender 
architecture has been witnessed in the agriculture field lately. 
Climatic conditions play a very impor tant role in agriculture. 
By considering the importance of climate a crop improvisation 
recommender system based on climate was built with an 
average accuracy score of ninety percent. A combination of 
collaborative filtering and case -based reasoning enhanc es the 
performance of recommending the best weather condition 
based on the crop. The recommender system combined 
collaborative filtering along with case -based reasoning 
making it a novel approach in a hybrid recommender system 
[24]. Krishi Mantra is an agr iculture recommendation system 
developed by considering the advantages of ontology and deep 
learning. They identified the gap that present in the data 
availability and its reachability, they built a domain ontology 
which acts as a knowledge base and recomm ends the required 
information based on the geographical data, the recommender 
system inherits the advantages of neural network and resolves 
the query from the farmers [25].  
A collaborative recommender system to answer the 
questions of the farmer based on t he proposed government 
schemes was built efficiently which supported three languages 
[26]. SyrAgri is a recommender system that sends 
recommendations in Mali to the farmer using a collaborative 
filtering approach. It recommends practices of the crop and 
type of crop based on parameters like soil type, yield, season, 
and life cycle of the crop [27].  
With the previously mentioned studies, we observe that 
ontology is an efficient knowledge management system for a 
multi dimension involving fields like agricultu re. To make a 
decision or predict from the knowledge an application of deep 
learning which is capable of not just processing the data but 
also which can learn the features from the data can be applied 
to recommend organic fertilizers to the farmers based o n the 
soil type. The previous efforts mostly concentrated on 
recommending crops, pest control and fertilizer 
recommendation which lacked a domain ontology which eases 
the knowledge storage, the study also shows organic fertilizer 
recommender system was not  been considered extensively.  
 
 
3. METHODOLOGY  
 
3.1 Data over -view  
 
The data relating to soil chemical property is gathered from the agricultural soil testing centres near Mysuru, Karnataka, 
India. The chemical properties which were measured from the 
soil are PH, EC, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. The 
soil is mainly identified and classified as black and red soil. 
The information related to organic fertilizers with respect to 
the soil quality is gathered from the farmers who have adopted 
organic cultivation practices and also from the government 
fertilizer centre experts from the data collected region.  
 
3.2 Domain ontology  
 
A domain ontology is the best solution when we are dealing 
with agricultural data which is heterogeneous and has 
difficulty i n interoperability [28]. Hence, we built a domain 
ontology by considering an overall aspect of agriculture 
activities and the dependent factors required for sustainable 
growth.  
Ontology building is a continuous and iterative process. 
Complete understanding  of the domain from different sources 
and validation is a key challenge. It must be capable of 
adapting to future changes without requiring the same amount 
of rework . Identification of class, sub -class their respective 
objects, properties, inheritance and hierarchy which are the 
major skeleton of the ontology is identified according to the 
domain.  
We used proté gé  as a tool to build the ontology [29, 30]. 
The tool is capable to handle the structure easily. It also allows 
querying the ontology effectively.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Class and sub class of soil and its chemical 
properties  
 
In the initial stage, a part of domain ontology was built 
concerning soil chemical properties. Based on the constructed 
ontology, we built a deep neural network to classify the soil 
into healthy or non -healthy depending on the chemical 
parameter. The system helped to store the knowledge 
effectively and retrieve the information. As already 
mentioned, ontology enables data to be in a machine -readable 
format. By utilizing this we classif ied the soil into healthy and 
unhealthy classes with a backpropagation algorithm which 
produced 93 percent of accuracy [15]. In the later stage, 
ontology is extended by adding all the required domains which 
are necessary for agriculture. The extension invo lved organic 
fertilizer as a domain with respect to the data collected. Figure 
1, represents the domain ontology hierarchy with respect to 
soil types present in the region and its chemical property and 
also their sub classes. Figure 2, represents the domai n ontology 
hierarchy of organic fertilizers and their instances.

3.3 Recommender system  
 
The previous model was built using backpropagation to 
classify the soil as healthy and unhealthy and is considered as 
a base model . We built a recommender system to recommend 
an organic fertilizer based on the lack of nutrient component 
in the soil when th e soil is classified as unhealthy. The pictorial 
flow of the architecture of the recommender system is 
explained using Figure 3.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Overview of the architecture of recommender 
system  
 
3.3.1 Wide and deep neural network for recommendation  
Wide c omponents in a generalized linear model which are 
combined  with the neural network are the main idea of wide 
and deep neural networks.  
 
 
 
Figure 4. Wide and deep neural network architecture  
 
Memorization is learning the periodic or habitual 
occurrence of the behavior, item or feature and learning the 
correlation present in the historical data. Generally memorizing happens in a linear format to predict the output. 
Generalization is understanding and containing the correlation 
and generating a new feature which is very new and has not 
occurred in the past. This solves the cold -start problem by 
understanding the patterns and generalizing them. The 
generalization and memorization concept explaining the 
architecture of the model is represented usin g Figure 4.  
The architecture helps to train wide linear models and deep 
neural networks to combinedly do the recommendation by 
adopting generalization and memorization techniques to 
recommend items [31]. The wide component is nothing but a 
generalization o f the linear model. Y=wTx+ b, where Y is the 
prediction and x=[x1, x2, x3, …., x d] is a vector of features. 
w=[w1, w 2, w 3, …., w d] is the model features. The feature 
contains raw input and its features which are then transformed. 
The cross -product transform ation is defined as the below 
equation. This helps in generalizing the model.  
 
ϕk(x)=𝜋𝑥𝑐𝑘𝑖
𝑖 𝑖=1𝑑 (1) 
 
where, cki belongs {0,  1}. 
The deep component in the architecture is a feed -forward 
neural network. This component helps in converting high -
dimensional features are converted to lower -level dimensions 
which are nothing but embedding’s. They are first initialized 
randomly and then va lues are trained to minimize the final loss. 
The converted low -dimension embedding’s are then fed into 
hidden layers of the neural network. The computation of 
hidden layer is shown below.  
 
𝑝(𝑖+1)=𝑓(𝑋(𝑖)𝑎(𝑖)+𝑏(𝑖)) (2) 
 
Both the components are then combine d by the weighted 
sum of their output logs and then fed to one loss function for 
training. Joint training  happens by back -propagating the 
gradients from the output end to both model at the same time.  
 
3.3.2 Deep learning and restricted boltzmann machine (R BM) 
for domain specific ontology  
RBM are shallow networks that act as a building block of 
deep neural networks. The domain -specific ontology of soil 
and fertilizers are derived based on the ontology -based deep 
restricted Boltzmann machine model (OB-DRBM). This 
model helps to build the ontology by guiding the architecture 
of semantics and also helps in training and the validation of 
the model [32].  
With our domain -oriented ontology which has the semantic 
level knowledge of soil fertility along wit h their fertilizers, we 
use OR -DRBM to guide in building the architecture of the 
ontology which also helps in training and validation of the 
deep learning model. Many challenges faced by deep learning 
in feature learning, predicting, and memory issues can be 
actively and effectively addressed using domain ontology 
which is constructed using OR -DRBM. It helps in making our 
domain ontology learn the representations related to the 
ontology. The representations are actually composed of the 
regular type of data with the complex semantic structure of the 
ontology.  
The OR -DRBM are actually an extension of the Restricted 
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which uses stochastic binary 
units, RBM’s are made of deep learning neural networks that 
are fully connected with hidden la yers and not within layers 
[33]. RBM have visible layers as ‘ v’ and invisible layers as ‘ h’, 
which are structured as a bipartite graph.  
464
  
 
Figure 5.  RBM architecture of hidden and visible layers  
 
The probability of connection between hidden and visible 
are given as p(v, h), X is the partition function . The hidden and 
visibility of the function in RBM model and interconnection 
between them are explained in the Figure 5.  
 
𝑝(𝑣,ℎ)=exp⁡(−𝐸(𝑣,ℎ))
𝑋 (3) 
 
The RBM binary units A (v, h) are defined with the below 
function, while { xi, yi} are bias function for hidden and visible 
layers. This explains the probability of connections between 
them.  
 
𝐴(𝑣,ℎ)=−∑𝑥𝑖𝑣𝑖−∑𝑦𝑗ℎ𝑗
𝑗 𝑖−∑𝑣𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑤𝑖𝑗
𝑖,𝑗 (4) 
 
OB-DRBM architecture follows a hierarchical approach, 
which starts  from top classes and then starts adding up sub -
classes. In our domain ontology being O and semantic 
reasoning being R becomes the basic building block OB -
DRBM model U. This follows sub -class relations ρ(c) ∈Q for 
each concept c ∈C, for C, Q ∈O. The model building starts by 
adding the top class of our ontology c ∈C for the sequence of 
subclass Sc. For every class of the ontology c ∈Sc we build the 
DRBM model. DRBM takes only its input for the top class of 
the ontology, the subclass takes input from the higher level and 
also from its own.  
As we already have the DRBM model for every concept in 
the ontology we adopt a softmax layer Sc which makes 
learning semantic rich learning in agriculture ontology very 
easy. The softmax layer contains the target unit at every 
semantic level. Along with the softmax layer for every concept 
and DRBM layer, we also add multiple hidden multiple visible 
restricted Boltzmann machine (MVMH) layer Mc for the 
subclasses. For every concept c in our ontology, we have the 
DRBM model and each concept is connected to the softmax 
layer. DRBM decodes the feature from top -level concepts 
before passing it to the lower  sub-classes during this process 
MVMH layer helps in generating an easy and understandable 
representation of high features and feeds into the lower sub -
classes.  
The OB -DRBM model is trained just like any other 
Boltzmann model. Initially, the model is train ed module -wise 
and layer -wise by applying the greedy method. In the next 
stage, stochastic gradient descent is used across all the softmax 
layers to fine -tune the model. This method reduces the error 
for the layers of softmax output produced. We validate t he 
consistency of output generated from every softmax layer in 
our model by applying a logistic regression. Let output from 
softmax be S then the output is explained by the below 
equation.  𝑧̃=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑠∁𝑆∏𝑐∈𝑠𝑓𝐶(𝑛,𝑤)[𝑅(𝑂,𝑥→𝑠)]
∑∏𝑐∈𝑠 𝑠∁𝑆 fc(n,w)[R(O,x→s)]⁡ (5) 
 
 
4. RESULTS  
 
The domain ontology model which emphasizes deep 
learning recommender systems to predict the organic 
fertilizers produced a promising result depending on the soil's 
chemical properties.  
The construction of the ontology is the first step in 
structuring  and making the knowledge base for the agriculture 
domain. We built soil information ontology and organic 
fertilizers ontology by collecting the information from the 
farmers and stake holders  using the protege tool and validated 
the ontology by querying  the knowledge. In the next step we 
utilize the ontology by publishing it to sematic world and 
combine with our deep learning model to extensively use the 
knowledge  to predict the organic  fertil izers based on the soil 
chemical properties.  
Our model takes input from farmers which are been tested 
at soil testing centres based on these values the recommender 
model recommends the top ‘N’ number of fertilizers, the 
farmers can choose the best among t he recommendation.  
The result in the recommender system is measured based on 
precision and recall. Both precision and recall take a value 
between 0 and 1. For every input from the user, the model 
produces an ‘N’ recommendation and the value of precession 
and recall is produced for the recommended items [34]. We 
also get a prediction rating for the recommended item, if the 
predicted rating is greater than 3.5 for the item then the item is 
relevant if lesser than 3.5 then the item is irrelevant.  
Precision i n the recommender system: Precision measures 
the amount of correctness the model predicted i.e. it gives the 
answer for the number of items which are correct from the 
recommendation system [35]. The top ‘N’ recommended 
items are given by calculating the pr ecision. The precession is 
given based on the below pattern : 
 
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛
=(𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟⁡𝑜𝑓⁡𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 ⁡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚⁡𝑎𝑡⁡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑁′′𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡⁡𝑎𝑟𝑒⁡𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 )
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟⁡𝑜𝑓⁡𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 ⁡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑠⁡𝑎𝑡⁡𝑁 (6) 
 
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =(𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 ∩𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 )
𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 (7) 
 
Consider an example of how precision is calculated for the 
recommendation  produced by the model for the user whose 
chemical property is Nitrogen and whose value is 27. 9 which 
is actually a very low value. The system recommends the top 
three items as fertilizers for the value given. The precision 
values are mentioned below for the recommended items. The 
organic fertilizers are numbered with a unique identification 
number  for more convenience in preparing ontology and 
model training. We have mentioned the name of the fertilizers 
in the brackets in the below Table  2.  
Recall in recommender system: Recall defines the 
proportion of recommended  items that are relevant among th e 
items that are actually recommended [35]. The recall is 
expressed by the below equation.  
 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
=(𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟⁡𝑜𝑓⁡𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 ⁡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚⁡𝑎𝑡𝑁′′𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡⁡𝑎𝑟𝑒⁡𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 )

With the above -discussed values of precision and recall for 
the value of Nitrogen entered by the user, the model is about 
to produce 80% precision in recommending the user organic 
fertilizers to be used to enrich the soil with Nitrogen 
components. The mode l can predict top N fertilizers for all the 
other chemical values given by the user.  
 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS  
 
We build a domain ontology by observing and considering 
most of the important dimensions involved in agriculture. We 
built and validated the ontology by utilizing OR -DRBM 
architecture. The model is populated with the data from soil 
testing centres and built a wide deep neural network 
architecture to recommend fertilizers to the farmers. Our 
architecture can be reproduced by adding any more clas ses or 
features without involving major changes. Ontology can be 
reused by adding any other dimensions required by agriculture 
depending on the socio conditions and regions. We have 
majorly considered soil properties for recommending 
fertilizers, the same methodology can be used to recommend 
the type of crop to be grown under recommended climatic 
conditions. Wide and deep neural network which is considered 
to recommend organic fertilizers had given promising 
performance with accuracy of 80 percent depending  on the 
user soil chemical property. There is still a more place to 
improvise the accuracy of the recommender model in the 
future by adoting demographic or more complex hybrid 
recommender systems.  
The model can also be extended to recommend the demand 
and supply of the crop based on the region, recommend 
warehouse availability and also the pricing of the crop.
