Food regime theory provides a framework of continued and recurring interest 
to geographical perspectives in charting the contours connecting agri- food and 
capitalist political economy. Drawing principally on Marxian regulation theory, 
the analytical framework of food regime theory outlines three periodised regimes 
from the starting point of 1870 to the present day. Yet there remains ongoing and 
unresolved debate as to how we characterise the contemporary third regime –  
and whether it is a regime on its own specific terms or merely an enduring hango-
ver from the second. I argue that an underacknowledged dimension of attempts 
to characterise the third regime lies in the conjoined relationship between human 
and planetary health, which the diagnosis of the Anthropocene encourages us 
to recognise amid tumultuous global environmental change. Given food regime 
theory's evasive relationship with ecological dynamics within its explanatory 
framework, I suggest that a “planetary” retheorisation of its central contributions 
is increasingly prescient. In considering the growing tensions and contradictions 
afflicting the contemporary regime, and using soy as a working example, I work 
through three central arguments. First, that a planetary retheorisation serves to 
reveal the way in which planetary dynamics shape social life, enabling –  albeit 
never wholly determining –  food regimes. Second, that what and how people eat 
in their dietary practices are of planetary significance, which has been to some de-
gree marginalised within the production- centric analyses of food regime theory. 
Third, that the conceptual Anthropocene highlights how planetary and human 
health are intricately and inextricably connected, which food regime theory must 
better account for. I conclude by proposing that the explanatory potential of the 
contemporary third regime is being stretched, with contested trajectories and 
nascent contours raising questions around how we might understand quite what 
we are living through today.

1 | INTRODUCTION
This paper seeks to reconsider Food Regime Theory (henceforth FRT) in light of the growing salience of the Anthropocene 
diagnosis as a fundamental “step-  change … [in] the relationship of the human species to the natural world” (Hamilton 
et al., 2015, p. 3). I argue that while FRT as originally conceptualised by Harriet Friedmann and Philip McMichael (spe -
cifically see Friedmann & McMichael, 1989) has made significant and important contributions to understanding the 
historical contours connecting the political economy of capitalism and agri- food, its contributions might be productively 
extended. Here I suggest that FRT's analytical framework ought to be brought into closer dialogue with recent calls for a 
“planetary turn” in the social sciences (Clark & Szerszynski, 2020). These calls emerge from growing recognition of the 
deep entanglements between the human –  and the domain of the social –  and the planetary (Willett et al., 2019). While 
I argue that FRT provides a valuable vantage point for geographical perspectives in exploring the global flows and power 
relations that constitute these differing historical regimes, I suggest that it has been markedly less successful in account -
ing for their ecological and biophysical foundations. This situation is problematic as the Anthropocene encourages us 
to recognise the way in which the planet has never simply provided a “neutral” backdrop to human activity but actively 
co- constitutes social life (cf., Krausmann & Langthaler, 2019). To develop this argument, I suggest that a planetary rethe -
orisation of FRT invites greater recognition and exploration of their co-  constitution through entangled biophysical and 
political-  economic processes, “thinking with” the nascent contours of the contemporary third regime and its possible 
trajectories in the Anthropocene.
Retheorising FRT in this way is important if we are to fully grasp the planetary significance of the contemporary third 
regime and its wide- ranging implications both in and beyond agri- food. Despite FRT's extensive influence and broad 
explanatory appeal for social scientific and geographical perspectives (Sage, 2013), little has been done to situate this 
significant body of literature in dialogue with the Anthropocene qua a geological epoch arrived at via humanity's influ-
ence in shaping the “natural” planet and the functioning of Earth systems. Yet agri- food is one of, if not the, domain that 
most profoundly shapes humanity's relationship with the planet, implicating everything from biogeochemical cycles, to 
the hydrological cycle, the fundamental characterisation of the world's largest biomes, and far beyond (Foley et al., 2011; 
Reisman & Fairbairn, 2020).1 This lack of dialogue is partly due to divergent theoretical underpinnings, with the concep -
tual Anthropocene emerging from a lineage in the natural sciences focused on the complex workings of Earth systems 
(Lorimer, 2016). FRT, in contrast, is grounded in the political economy perspective of Marxian regulation theory, which 
can be conceptualised as an “effort to develop a theory of the regulation of capitalism which isolates the conditions, 
rhythms and forms of its social transformation” (Aglietta, 2000, p.15; emphasis mine). Though FRT from its inception has 
sought to avoid an overly structuralist analysis pockmarking much Marxian political economy (Friedmann, 2017, p. 260), 
its central objective lies in “link[ing] international relations of food production and consumption to forms of accumula-
tion broadly distinguishing periods of capitalist transformation since 1870” (Friedmann & McMichael, 1989, p. 95).2 Yet 
if the changing regulation of capitalism is expressed through patterns of social transformation, this transformation is at 
one and the same time ecological. As humanity faces increasingly precarious and uncertain futures, the Anthropocene 
entails that this latter dimension can no longer be marginalised in our theorisations.
While we return to this point later, recent years have seen growing interest in FRT's explanatory potentialities, with the 
framework furthered in various directions (see, e.g., Campbell, 2009; Evans et al., 2012; Pritchard, 2009). As Sage (2013) 
convincingly demonstrates, the pliability of FRT within its broad explanatory scope is one of its significant strengths, 
with his account focusing on the shifts that have enabled a geographically uneven spread of “Western” diets premised 
on “energy-  dense, nutrient- poor ‘pseudo foods’ … comprising high levels of vegetable oils, animal fats, sugar and salt” 
(Sage, 2013, p. 76).3 In the contemporary third food regime, Sage suggests that these forms of malconsumption sit directly 
alongside malnutrition, exemplifying the strange antinomies of the third regime. While Patel (2008) quips that the world 
is divided into a “stuffed” global North and “starved” global South, such an understanding is problematised by shifting 
dietary practices in countries including China and India, which demonstrate growing appetites for meat and dairy re -
spectively. Given these nuanced efforts to understand and characterise the human consequences of the third regime, this 
account must be reconciled with those that note how the status quo does not simply impact our own health –  as in Sage's 
malconsumption –  but also confers profound implications for the future of the planet (Willett et al., 2019).
I argue that this is why it is important to bring FRT into dialogue with the conceptual Anthropocene. Despite some 
notable attempts to try and tease out the ecological foundations of food regimes (Campbell, 2009), these perspectives 
arguably do not go far enough in their recognition of the Anthropocene as an age in “which human activity has dis -
cernibly affected the Earth's global functioning to such an extent it is now operating outside the range of any previous 
natural variability” (Wright et al., 2018, p. 456). It is at this juncture that this paper seeks to make its central contribution,

acknowledging the “provocation [of the Anthropocene] to think social life through the Earth” (Clark & Szerszynski, 
2020, p. 13; emphasis in original). I argue that a regime-  orientated approach does not merely help to illuminate the ways 
in which capital coalesces through specific configurations to reinvigorate patterns of capital accumulation, but it addi-
tionally reveals how planetary dynamics come to be inculcated within trajectories that exceed –  or perhaps elide –  their 
political-  economic foundations.
This paper proceeds as follows. First, I expand on these initial considerations by detailing the main contributions of 
FRT, offering a brief characterisation of the three regimes in the process. Noting the oddly marginalised position of the 
ecological foundations of the regimes within these discussions, I then shift to considering theorisations that have offered 
constructive interjections within FRT to attempt to fill this gap. In doing so, I pay particular attention to Hugh Campbell's 
important contributions. Arguing that FRT must better account for the planetary, I turn to considering the case of soy 
in greater depth. I argue that soy is critical to understanding the third regime and its deleterious impacts on human and 
planetary health. Finally, considering the possible trajectories engendered by this situation, I draw the paper to a close 
by outlining where the third regime might lead as a growing variety of counter- logics to the status quo continue to gain 
traction.
2 | TRACING FOOD REGIMES
While for this paper it is not necessary to offer a fully comprehensive genealogy of FRT (for such an account, see McMichael, 
2009), it is nonetheless useful to briefly characterise the development of the three regimes. As Friedmann and McMichael 
outline in their pivotal Sociologia Ruralis paper (see Friedmann & McMichael, 1989), the first regime (1870– 1914) was 
premised on the “culmination in the colonial organization of precapitalist regions” (Friedmann & McMichael, 1989, p. 
95) within a new international “world economy.” This regime saw long- established legacies of colonialism formalised 
through capitalist social relations, with “wage foods,” primarily wheat and meat, fuelling accelerating capitalist develop-
ment in a Western European context. The emergence of specialised production methods (e.g., the plantation mode of 
production) entrenched the uneven nature of development resulting from flows from the global South to North within 
this regime. Though FRT has been critiqued for failing to fully theorise the demise of the first regime (see Bernstein, 
2016), a combination of European conflict, agricultural crisis and economic depression in the early to mid- 20th century 
led to a fundamental shift in patterns of capital accumulation. Magnan (2012) has convincingly argued that the first re-
gime instead came to a gradual end from 1925 to 1945, with the second regime coalescing in the context of US hegemony 
after the Second World War. Though finding many continuities with the first in terms of bringing agri- food further in line 
with the logic of industrialised capitalism, there were critical differences. The second entrenched productivist modes of 
agriculture in the USA, emphasising quantity over quality, redirecting enormous surplus outputs to the global South in 
the form of “food aid.” This has thereby led Pechlaner and Otero (2010) to ask if this may be better characterised as the 
“surplus regime.” As the so- called Green Revolution took hold –  an ironic label given the profound social and ecological 
costs associated with this era (Horlings & Marsden, 2011; see also Shiva, 2016) –  agri- food became increasingly mecha-
nised and industrialised with attendant technological advancements as well as being undergirded by strong state support.
This situation, however, did not last. The 1960s saw what Bernstein describes as a “fault line” (Bernstein, 2016, p. 621) 
widening between national economies and the transient flows of global capital, with this fault line intensifying through 
the emergence of neoliberal governance in the 1970s. With agriculture gradually losing its central position in US trade 
policy, and rising oil prices causing state debt to grow, Friedmann and McMichael trace an “overriding shift … from 
state to capital as the dominant structuring force” (1989, p. 112). The late 1970s have thus been suggested to play host 
to the emergence of a more ambiguous or nebulous third regime, which continues to the present day. Debate continues 
as to whether this might more aptly be conceptualised as the corporate (McMichael, 2012); corporate–  environmental 
(Friedmann, 2005), or neoliberal (Pechlaner & Otero, 2010) food regime. As Levidow suggests, these descriptors offer 
“contending narratives [which] justify different trajectories for agro- food transition” (2015, p. 76). For the sake of brevity, 
and leaving the question of these “contending narratives” deliberately open, Atkins and Bowler (2001) note three critical 
differences between the second and third regime: (1) increasingly vertically integrated agri- food corporations that have 
“now outgrown the regime that spawned them” (Friedmann, 1993, p. 52); (2) controversies around the growing role of 
biotechnology (particularly GMOs); alongside (3) accelerating processes of dietary change and consumer fragmentation. 
In short, attempts to characterise the regimes remain ongoing and contested, rather than settled areas of debate. A di-
mension worthy of further consideration in these debates lies in the ecological foundations of food regimes, to which we 
now turn in greater depth.

3 | FOOD REGIMES AND THEIR ECOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
As one of the more influential commentators attempting to redress the limitations of FRT within this contested space, it 
is particularly prescient to turn here to Hugh Campbell's work (see variously Campbell, 2009, 2016; Campbell & Dixon, 
2009; Campbell et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2012). Given that regimes are, by their very definition, constituted through 
historically contingent patterns of capital accumulation, the focus for FRT has at times risked an arguably evasive re-
lationship with their ecological foundations. Campbell notes how this political- economic grounding of Friedmann and 
McMichael's original theorisation entailed that it was only in the years that followed that a “space opened up … for 
discussion of ecological dynamics” (2009, p. 313). Campbell's critical appraisal attempts to situate the ecological dimen-
sions of food regimes not as epiphenomenal, but instead as foundational to the task of understanding and characterising 
them. As Campbell continues, the colonial legacies underpinning the first regime enacted “complex and consequential 
relationships –  ecologies at a distance –  that would eventually breach a series of ecological thresholds” (2009, p. 313; em-
phasis in original). Yet, intriguingly, the specificities of this historical period entailed that the consequences were borne 
out in equally distanced and geographically uneven ways, with the rapidly industrialising Western European countries 
that benefitted remaining protected by virtue of distance. As Krausmann and Langthaler argue, this regime was in effect 
an “offshoring” or “externalization of agricultural production” (2019, p. 90), fuelling economic development in coun-
tries such as England far beyond the possible scope of national agricultural production. Given that FRT and its analysis 
are methodologically as much about temporary crystallisations of patterns of capital accumulation as the exogenous 
and endogenous forces that transform them, Campbell notes Friedmann's (2005) acknowledgement that the ecological 
consequences of the first regime being “held at arm's length” could only endure for so long without throwing the entire 
regime into a state of disarray (Campbell, 2009, p. 313).
As we have already traced, this disarray nonetheless contributed to the formation of the second regime. The ecological 
foundations of this regime have been considered in much greater depth than the first, given the centrality of the Green 
Revolution within it (see, e.g., Biel, 2016; Hetherington, 2020; Patel, 2013). Here the intensification of agricultural activity 
and growing dislocation from seeming “natural” limits to productivity could only be sustained –  and further intensified 
–  if the associated costs were continually externalised. Significantly, that the geographical locus of the second regime 
was the USA brought these implications closer to home, rather than pushed outwards to a postcolonial periphery as in 
the first. For the USA, the other side of rampant agricultural overproduction therefore lay in “impacts on biodiversity, 
air quality, water quality and soil” and, in notable difference to the crises of the first regime, “emerging evidence of [in-
terrelated] threats to human health … like Alar residues on apples, E coli outbreaks, salmonella in eggs and Mad Cow 
Disease” (Campbell, 2009, p. 314; see also Hetherington, 2020). These conjoined and entangled crises –  of the human and 
the planetary –  have only intensified in the decades that have followed.4
By comparison to the second, the third regime's contested status within the literature presents difficulties in character -
ising its distinct ecological foundations. Questions around whether it represents a regime proper or is merely an enduring 
hangover of the second regime remain (for a fuller consideration, see Pritchard, 2009). Importantly, however, Campbell 
suggests that the third regime is playing host to increasingly powerful social movements “seek[ing] to reconfigure the 
‘orderings’ of the socio-  ecological engendered by conventional agro- food” (Goodman et al., 2012, p. 51). These include 
Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) and food sovereignty movements which further food “from somewhere” contra the 
placeless food “from nowhere” characteristic of mainstream productivism (Bové & Dufour, 2001). Without wishing to 
rehearse longstanding debates about the transformative capacities of these movements (for a fuller discussion, see Holt 
Giménez & Shattuck, 2011), Campbell's food “from somewhere” evokes discourses of resilience by recognising the “cen-
trality of strong ecological signals and feedbacks in enabling positive social adaptive responses to shocks and threats” 
(Campbell, 2009, p. 314).
While an important interjection and contribution to FRT, Campbell's curious choice to frame the third regime in 
cybernetic terms –  through a language of signals, feedbacks, and “shocks” –  risks raising more questions than answers. 
After all, such an understanding risks reinforcing a problematic separation of the social, on the one hand, and the eco -
logical on the other. I suggest that such a separation is increasingly untenable, and that we must reconsider these un-
derstandings of the third regime. After all, the Anthropocene diagnosis –  as an age in which humans have paradoxically 
become a “force of nature” –  encourages us to think instead in terms of their conjoined relationship. As the recent and 
highly publicised EAT- Lancet report on food in the Anthropocene (Willett et al., 2019) notes, regimes of capital accumu-
lation can never be wholly dislocated from the planet, and thus by extension the “boundaries … [which] define the safe 
operating space for environmental systems and processes” (Willett et al., 2019, p. 461). I argue that the growing urgency

surrounding this recognition, taken alongside the continued contestations around how we characterise the third regime, 
entails that we must find ways to better theorise and situate the planet within FRT.
4 | TOWARDS A “PLANETARY TURN”
In contrast with these ecologically inflected readings, thinking planetarily about food regimes necessitates theorising 
them as phenomena that result, as Clark and Szerszynski suggest, from the “active conjoining of powers from across the 
different parts of the Earth: human, more- than- human, fully inhuman” (Clark & Szerszynski, 2020, p. 15). This emphasis 
on “conjoining” therefore rests on recognising more- than- human agencies that actively constitute our world, breaking 
down conceptual efforts to neatly divide the “social” and “ecological” as distinct and discrete. To provide a grounded 
example, Krzywoszynska's exploration of soil makes an important contribution in arguing that framing soil as an instru-
mental “resource” to be used risks ignoring the “indispensability of non- human lives to the creation and maintenance of 
human life and its environments” (2019, p. 2). Without recognising these agencies and finding new ways to relate to the 
world in which we live, humanity risks undermining the conditions that make life possible (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015).
This point tacks with Szerszynski's (2018) argument that a planetary turn is therefore a fundamental effort to rethink 
tendencies at the very core of the social sciences. Treating the social as bounded and meaningful on its own terms and 
therefore epistemologically divisible from Earth system processes is increasingly untenable in the Anthropocene, and we 
must re- think tendencies that exempt humans from the biophysical environments in which we live. The diverse schol-
arship that has flourished around the Anthropocene points to the ways in which such an understanding was not only 
misguided from the outset but also increasingly requires rethinking in an age where our precarious futures will be so 
profoundly shaped by complex and precariously balanced Earth systems that, once shifted by wider human activities and 
“in motion,” risk irreversibly and drastically altering wider biophysical conditions.
My intention here is not to provide a full review of the Anthropocene scholarship, nor to consider the many wide- 
ranging implications of these calls for a planetary turn for Western thought. Such tasks are beyond the bounds of this 
paper. I suggest that the aim here is more modest, and instead follows these provocations to consider how retheorising 
FRT in a planetary way may enable better understandings of the third regime and where its trajectories may take us. To 
do this, I focus on a crop that is particularly significant for understanding the third regime: soy. I suggest that while the 
expansion of soy production in recent decades may be explained by political-  economic dynamics within the rubric of 
FRT, such an explanation risks eliding planetary dynamics that cannot be simply appended to this account but must be 
taken at its core.
5 | SITUATING SOY IN THE THIRD REGIME
Soy is far from an arbitrary choice for such a discussion, and I suggest that its history provides a lens of critical impor-
tance to the discussion here. The global production of soybeans has increased drastically in the four decades from 1978 to 
2018 (Hospes, 2010). As Patel and Moore quip, while soy may therefore be characterised as the “paradigmatic neoliberal 
crop” (2017, p. 166), it might alternatively be framed as the paradigmatic crop of the third food regime. Importantly, the 
third regime captures more than just the rollout of neoliberal governance. FAOSTAT data show that in 1978 global soy-
bean production occupied 46.4 million hectares, producing a total output of 75.4 million tonnes. In 2018, by comparison, 
124.9 million hectares produced a total output of 348.7 million tonnes. Land use for soybean production has therefore 
increased by a factor of 2.6 during this period, with output increasing by a factor of 4.6. While during this period the USA 
remained the largest national producer, the story of soy reveals the significance of the emergence of “new” agricultural 
countries. Brazil produced 117.9  million tonnes in 2018, just below the USA, which produced 123.7  million tonnes. 
As Goldsmith (2008) traces, significant efforts in the USA in the 1950s adapted soy to lower latitudes of the Southern 
states, where the bulk of poultry farming is located, in order to provide farmers with cheap, protein- rich feed. Brazilian 
researchers further adapted soy to suit lower latitudes. The “bundling” and locking in of these contingent technological 
and economic processes would thus serve to establish Brazil, decades later, as an agricultural superpower in geopo-
litical terms (Brannstrom et al., 2012). Furthermore, the development of genetically modified “Roundup Ready” soy by 
Monsanto, designed to be tolerant to glyphosate herbicide, ensured that soybeans could be grown in these monocultures 
with little in the way of labour input and at unprecedented scales (Hetherington, 2020). If these trajectories continue, 
Brazil appears likely to become the largest global soybean producer within the next decade (Araújo et al., 2019). Yet these

shifts confer many “dark sides,” with Brooke and Otter suggesting that the monocultures of hitherto unknown scale in 
which soy is grown represent the “defining mark of Anthropocene ecologies” (Brooke and Otter, cited in Hetherington, 
2020, p. 4).
Yet examining these trends on the supply-  side does not wholly explain why soybean production has ramped up so 
drastically in recent decades. As a native crop of East Asia, the direct human consumption of soy has historically been 
largely limited to tofu, tempeh, and soymilk. As a prime example of agri- food “complexes” connecting disparate com-
modities, approximately 80% or more of global soybean production is used as animal feed (Guthman, 2015). As Hoelle 
(2017) traces, Brazil is again significant here, with the bulk of its soy either exported to China as pig feed or used to feed 
the expanding national poultry industry. This situation leads Hospes to wryly note that the question for global agri- food 
governance is no longer “‘can we feed the hungry?’ but ‘can we feed the animals?’” (2010, p. 349). The forms of industrial 
agriculture enabled by crops like soy are profoundly changing the planet as we know it: today, the planetary biomass of 
livestock is approximately 14 times that of “wild” mammals, with this magnitude set to continue growing (Bar-  On et al., 
2018).
The vast majority of soybeans being used to feed animals in the production of meat is, in basic metabolic terms, 
remarkably inefficient (Sabaté & Soret, 2014). The broiler chicken, as Coles (2016) notes, is relatively efficient, with an 
approximate Feed Ratio Conversion (FRC) of 2:1, i.e., each kilogram of meat requires two of feed. The production of 
pork and beef is significantly less efficient, with approximate FRCs of 6:1 to 13:1 respectively (Sabaté & Soret, 2014). At 
their most fundamental, these political economies serve to remove calories that might be directly consumed by humans, 
inefficiently cycling them through the material bodies of animals in their production. For perspectives such as Hansen 
and Jacobsen (2020), cheap soy has therefore contributed to the “meatification” of diets, which, as with much of this dis -
cussion, plays out in geographically uneven ways. The growing demand for meat in many East Asian countries is symp -
tomatic of these shifts, with “Chinese average annual per capita meat consumption increas[ing] more than eighteen- fold 
from 1961 to 2013, reaching 61.05 kgs” (2020, p. 10). Though per capita these levels remain low by comparison with more 
“developed” countries, these trajectories arguably represent “the core of the unsustainability of global food and agricul-
ture” (2020, p. 14). Efforts to mitigate the damage associated with these trends have not been successful. For example, the 
certification of soy through “eco- label” schemes such as the Roundtable on Responsible Soy in Brazil have had limited 
uptake (van der Ven et al., 2018). This, to a great extent, is because soy remains “completely ‘invisible’ to the ultimate 
purchaser” (Virah-  Sawmy et al., 2019, p. 221), consumed largely “by proxy” through the metabolic processes that produce 
the meaty bodies of animals.
These difficulties around reforming soy production must be situated within what is now a wider set of struggles. As 
Soendergaard (2018) notes, growing reliance on fertilisers in Brazilian soy monocultures has led to struggles between 
“land grabbing” agri- businesses (McMichael, 2012) and indigenous communities. As a notable example, in 2010 geol-
ogists discovered a significant potash deposit near Autazes, a municipality in the Amazon basin west of the Madeira 
River. As a significant net importer of potassium to be used as agricultural fertiliser, the discovery of this deposit was 
of enormous significance for Brazilian agribusiness. The Madeira River is already used to transport soy from the most 
significant soy- producing state, Mato Grasso, towards the Amazon for onwards shipment around the world. As a result, 
much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place to transport the potash to soy- producing areas. Yet a significant 
barrier to this is the fact that the location for the potash mine lies in indigenous territory, representing yet another chapter 
in the history of indigenous Amazonian struggle against the extractivist logics of increasingly powerful and politically 
influential agri- businesses (Baletti, 2012). Though there is no telling how such struggles may play out, they appear likely 
to intensify and serve as a timely reminder of the ways in which the geological histories of the planet become inculcated 
within the contemporary food regime.
6 | CONTESTED TRAJECTORIES
On the one hand, the picture painted by this exploration of the critical role of soy in the contemporary food regime may 
seem bleak, commensurate with FRT's wider tendency to further a “culture of pessimism … [given] the broader struc-
tural forces of capitalism” (Campbell & Dixon, 2009, p. 264). Though tracing the future contours of a food regime as it is 
“in process” is a necessarily speculative task, given that the ways in which it “will eventually unfold [are] not yet clear” 
(Burch & Lawrence, 2009, p. 277), FRT has sought to position contemporary shifts characterising the third regime within 
“a larger restructuring of capitalism” (Friedmann, 2005, p. 229). Yet as the above discussion shows, to fully understand

and characterise the third regime, we must understand the way in which these contradictions are playing out, develop-
ing, and ultimately deepening at a planetary level.
Critically, the deepening of these contradictions will have conjoined impacts for humans and the planet. Given that 
monocultured soy production is, in many capacities, a “necessary condition” by which to understand the contemporary 
patterns of meatification of diets in countries such as China and Brazil, these shifting dietary practices are already having 
profound consequences for human health. Epidemiological increases in coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and type 
II diabetes follow (Potter, 2017), emphasising the profound consequences of these diets amid growing malconsumption 
(Sage, 2013). Yet as Elser and Bennett (2011) note, these impacts are conjoined with the planetary, given that the inherent 
inefficiencies associated with using soy to enable meat and dairy- heavy diets have drastically impacted biogeochemical 
cycles, particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus (see also Westhoek et al., 2014). Furthermore, it is important to recog -
nise that these outcomes are understood as non- linear and processually conjoined. As Whitmee et al. (2015) outline, the 
ways in which humanity has shifted the planet in the Anthropocene heralds an era in which ecological changes lead to 
various “impairments,” including climate change, changes in land use, desertification, and biodiversity loss. These have 
diverse impacts on health, including direct health effects (e.g., floods, heatwaves, pollution); ecosystem- mediated health 
effects (e.g., infectious disease risk, reduced food yields, and impacts on mental health); alongside indirect, deferred, and 
displaced health effects (e.g., displacement, conflict, inappropriate adaptation and mitigation). In sum, while historical 
food regimes necessarily and always have had impacts for human and planetary health, contemporary shifts are serving 
to reveal the increasingly entangled and complex nature of this relationship.
Taken as a whole, I suggest that these reflections have deep implications for understanding and characterising the third 
regime and its possible trajectories. In contrast with FRT's aforementioned pessimistic tendencies, Hugh Campbell's im-
portant diagnosis of the third regime identifies “new set[s] of counter- logics … stretching out from the main cloth” (2009, 
p. 318), chiefly through social movements and drives towards food “from somewhere.” Importantly, that such movements 
are gaining traction is a vital reminder that food regimes change. On the one hand, the striking images of monocultured 
soy crassly imposed where biodiverse landscapes once stood is a striking exemplification of the vicissitudes of short- 
sighted capitalist extractivism; an Anthropocene in which humans appear as little more than “rapacious earth eaters” 
(Buck, 2015, p. 371). But further examination of the critical role of soy in the third regime suggests that it may –  albeit in 
an emergent way –  represent a terrain in which other sets of counter- logics are coalescing. For example, a recent report 
published by the European Coordination Via Campesina and Eco Ruralis (see Chancellor, 2018) shows that soy grown in 
European polycultures in line with agro-  ecological principles is in practice more productive per hectare than the mono -
cultures of South America. Furthermore, it is what is done with this soy once it is produced that is important. In contrast 
with the geographically uneven processes of intensifying meatification, technological advancements allowing for soy to 
resemble increasingly “authentic” meat and dairy analogues have advanced in recent years, with markets for so-  called 
“flexitarian” consumers seeking to reduce their reliance on animal agriculture set to continue expanding (Sexton et al., 
2019).
While plant- based alternatives clearly ought not to be uncritically accepted as a “silver bullet” resolving the planetary 
contradictions of meatifying diets, they show a more critically optimistic dimension of FRT as attempts to enact different 
ways of “doing” food grow. For example, Foley et al.'s account (2011) notes that 16 major crops –  including soy –  which 
mainly feed animals in inefficient metabolic processes, if used for “human food consumption only … [would lead to] a 
28% increase in food availability, or the equivalent of a 49% increase in dietary energy for human consumption” (Sabaté 
& Soret, 2014, p. 481). Further, within their meta- analysis, Fresán and Sabanté (2019) note that considered purely in 
terms of greenhouse gases, ovolactovegetarian and vegan diets contribute between 35% and 49% less when contrasted 
with the typical reference diet, while also having a less significant impact on biogeochemical flows. While I do not intend 
to present these claims as exhaustive evidence of the ways in which the planetary contradictions of the third regime are 
neatly resolving themselves –  if anything, trends suggest that they will intensify further –  they nonetheless attest to both 
the growing diversity and traction of counter- logics within this regime. As the diagnosis of the Anthropocene attests, 
questions around whether these counter- logics will strengthen or abate in the third regime are increasingly prescient 
considerations, with profound implications for the trajectory of the planet.
7 | CONCLUSION
Since its inception, FRT has provided a deeply valuable framework for agri- food geographers as a diagnostic approach to 
understanding the complex interrelationship between agri- food and the political economy of capitalism. Its pessimistic

and at points overly structuralist tendencies notwithstanding, Campbell and Dixon more hopefully recognise that the 
various shifts across differing regimes also “show[s] that the system can change” (2009, p. 264; emphasis in original). Yet 
given FRT's theoretical approach and analysis through historical periodisation, its contribution has been somewhat lim-
ited on several fronts, including its engagement with the ecological and biophysical foundations of the different regimes. 
Furthermore, its production- centrism has risked an evasive analysis at other stages in the “value chain,” particularly 
consumption and processes of dietary change (an important exception being Sage, 2013).
Here I have argued that the Anthropocene forces us to recognise the planetary significance of food regimes, with soy 
providing a particularly prescient working example for this discussion. As the crop perhaps most centrally undergirding 
geographically uneven processes of dietary fragmentation, meatification, and malconsumption, the story of soy is re -
markable. Enormous increases of the production of soy within the third regime have enabled states of affairs that serve to 
degrade both human and planetary health, which I have suggested are increasingly conjoined in complex and non- linear 
ways. While these contestations around soy appear likely to intensify, the question of what and how people eat –  and its 
planetary implications –  are set to become increasingly important areas of debate. FRT at its most mutable provides an 
important framework for understanding the possible trajectories of the third regime within the Anthropocene, illumi-
nating whether the growing antinomies of the third regime might eventually coalesce in a new regime grounded in the 
entangled recognition of human and planetary health, or in a different configuration altogether.

 1 For example, the possible reclassification of the Amazon as a savannah biome (Lovejoy & Nobre, 2019).
 2 By foregrounding capitalism in its analysis, FRT tacks more closely with perspectives that advocate the Capitalocene (see notably Moore, 
2017). My argument here is that these differing “cenes” capture different phenomena and thus ought not to be framed as offering competing 
explanations. Conversely, I suggest that FRT might develop a more constructive dialogue with Anthropocene scholarship to a much greater 
degree than Capitalocene scholars have, to date, acknowledged.
 3 “Western” here is synonymous with “neoliberal” in other accounts (see, for example, Otero et al., 2015).
 4 A timely example of this lies in the growing recognition of the role of agri- food in the creation of new interfaces for novel zoonotic diseases 
(Ma et al., 2020). Hence, we might add the COVID- 19 pandemic to Campbell's list.
