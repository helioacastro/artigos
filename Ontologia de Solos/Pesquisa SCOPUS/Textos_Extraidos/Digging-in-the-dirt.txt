The aim of the paper is to propose additional viewpoints aimed at enhancing soil perception among the general 
public that could foster soil awareness, valorisation and, consequently, protection and stewardship.
Starting from soil security concept, introducing the pillars (the five Cs) for securing soil, the paper focuses on 
connectivity, with the aim of suggesting new perspectives to look at and deal with soil. In particular, the article 
encompasses semantic issues, analyses new attributes, and proposes communications tools, other than scientific 
language, that can effectively reach a broad audience. The article focuses on art because, in the present era of 
image-based communication, artworks show an effective and promising way to spread a “soil culture ”.
1.Introduction
“Soil is a non-renewable resource on a human time scale ”: this 
statement has always been firmly pointed out, since the beginning of soil 
science.
However, in the last two decades, alarming data regarding soil loss 
and irreversible degradation are being widely and continuously reported 
(FAO and ITPS, 2015 ; IPBES, 2018 ).
Therefore, the inconsistency between our apparent appreciation of 
the importance of soil and the lack of care towards it shows that, despite 
scientific evidence about the timescale for soils ’ renewal, their degra -
dation and loss have not been prevented. It may be argued that there is a 
disconnect in the relationship between land use planning and soils 
management and their actual status. In other words, current policies at 
local, national, or international scale, as well as individual attitudes such 
as the ethical behavior, do not show any awareness of soil’s slow 
regenerative processes.
The aim of this paper is therefore an attempt to focus on the factors 
underlying the contemporary common disregard towards the soil 
resource with the aim of proposing effective communications tools and 
languages, to promote soil knowledge, its cultural value and, ultimately, 
establish a soil culture (a term derived from the Latin cultura and meaning 
“to cultivate the soil”). In particular, Section 2presents the innovative 
perspective introduced by the soil security concept, Section 3provides 
an overview on semantic issues, such as soil definitions and vague soil- 
related terms, Section 4presents a brief discussion on the need to re- establish a soil ethical behavior, Section 5claims the need to use 
different forms of language to talk about the soil to the general public 
and, finally, Section 6explores the effectiveness of visual images such as 
artworks as the way to successfully accomplish this goal.
2.The soil security concept: an innovative perspective to look at 
soil
The soil security concept (McBratney et al., 2014 ; McBratney and 
Field, 2015 ) set an important milestone that helps to focus efforts aimed 
to spread soil awareness and improve soil stewardship.
It introduced, indeed, two important aspects that: i) change the 
perception towards soil and ii) offer the potential to different commu -
nications tools to reach a wider public. The first innovative aspect is that 
soil is placed in a central position with respect to societal and environ -
mental issues; it has been clearly pointed out, for the first time, that food 
and water security, energy sustainability, climate change abatement, 
biodiversity protection and ecosystem services delivery all depend on 
soil security (McBratney et al., 2014 ). Therefore, repositioning soil at the 
center of such issues certainly increases the awareness and attention that 
soil resource attracts. The global soil resource is heavily threatened and, 
in most cases, so irreversibly degraded that a serious concern about its 
potential to sustain future generations is acknowledged within the 
whole soil scientists ’ community (Ferreira et al., 2022 ). However, 
although such degradation levels and worldwide threats are constantly 
highlighted by soil scientists, few significant outcomes from

international and/or national policies, climate agreements etc. are 
specifically focused on soil protection. When dealing with environ -
mental issues, it can be demonstrated that soil has always been poorly 
considered, in most cases forgotten or included (as an embedded 
component) in the concept of land, landscape or territory. This is 
demonstrated clearly by the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) (UN General Assembly, 2015 ) whereby none of the 17 SDGs 
explicitly mention the word “soil”; despite the widespread knowledge 
that soil health and/or quality are, directly or indirectly, the prerequisite 
for most of them (Davies, 2017 ; Lal, 2018 ). In fact, to this point, Lal 
(2018) , in the preface of the volume “Soils and Sustainable Development 
Goals”, stated that: “this reflects an utter lack of awareness of the impor -
tance of the most basic of all natural resources on which depends all terres -
trial life – soils”.
Many authors agree that the neglect of soil is deeply rooted in his-
torical, social, religious and cultural reasons (Minami, 2009 ). In fact, it 
can be demonstrated that the gradual loss of a soil culture, which started 
with the industrial revolution and is most visible in todays’ technolog -
ical era, is at the heart of soil disaffection and disregard (Hermann, 
2006 ).
In the XXI century, mankind is almost completely disenfranchised 
from soil. Soil has been variously labelled a hidden resource (Robbins, 
2013 ), the soil underfoot (Jock Churchmann and Landa, 2014 ), a buried 
treasure (Davies, 2017 ), whose value is difficult to perceive particularly 
in urban areas where soil sealing hampers the mere view of it. “Most 
people are soil blind” reports Koons Garcia (2014) focusing on the simple 
act of seeing soil to acknowledge its importance. These attitudes can be 
seen as a general unawareness of it rather than a disregard.
Therefore, focusing attention on soil resource, and to its crucial role 
towards the main environmental challenges of the XXI century is 
welcome thanks to the soil security concept.
The second innovative aspect brought about by the concept of soil 
security lies in its five pillars. In fact, the five Cs (capacity, condition, 
capital, connectivity, and codification) provide additional tools and 
contexts that will help to promote soil knowledge.
The first two pillars, which considered together represent soil 
capability, refer to the bio-physical attributes of soil, specifically the 
aspects routinely considered by environmental scientists. Conversely, 
the last three pillars elevate the socioeconomic aspects, that may include 
a wider range of stakeholders in the pursuit of soil valorisation and 
stewardship, at the same level of importance. Capital, connectivity and 
codification underline, in fact, urgent issues such as: i) placing a mon-
etary value on soil, ii) identifying new communications tools to promote 
soil culture through education, iii) drafting laws and rules for soil pro-
tection (McBratney et al., 2014 ). Enhancing connectivity, would even-
tually serve to strengthen the other two pillars, capital and codification. 
In fact, only through soil knowledge and awareness can we undertake an 
accurate assessment of soil’s natural capital, promote a soil investment 
opportunity and spread robust soil policies aimed to regulate its use and 
protection (Mol and Keesstra, 2012 ).
Therefore, connectivity tends, among its aims, to promote soil cul-
ture. This can be achieved through different but integrated pathways 
such as: a) reviewing semantic issues (e.g. soil definitions and soil- 
related terms), b) re-thinking how mankind relate itself to soil re- 
establishing a “soil ethics”, c) considering soil, within and beyond 
educational processes, using different languages and communications 
tools such as art.
3.A matter of terms: the semantic issue
Before moving towards the many semantic issues related to soil, it 
should be underlined that the definition of “soil” itself is not a unique 
one (Hartemink, 2016 ). In an exhaustive reviewing chapter published in 
Advances in Agronomy in 2016, Hartemink lists, for example, 45 
different definitions taken from soil science textbooks from 1900 to 
2014. Starting from the early 1800 ′s, definitions of the term “soil” were based on developments in agricultural chemistry or geology, where soil 
was considered solely as a production factor. The past century has seen 
huge achievements in the field of soil science, bringing a new approach 
to the soil as a resource which encompasses not only the productive 
function but also includes additional fundamental ecological attributes 
(see the concept of soil health, Doran and Safley, 1997 ). Feller (2019)
focused on the difficulties in communicating about soil, demonstrating 
that “le sol des uns n’est pas celui des autres” meaning that many diverse 
actors deal with soil from different perspectives and using different 
definitions. What is meant by “soil” when used by an archeologist may 
not be the same for a geologist, a pedologist or an engineer.
Soil disregard is ascribable to several causes that may be grouped 
into few large categories such as: socio/cultural, historical, religious/ 
mythological, and semantic. As often reported in the literature (Baveye 
et al., 2016 ; Minami, 2009 ; Montgomery, 2007 ), soil’s reputational 
misfortune, within English speaking countries, lies in the word dirt 
which identifies soil in everyday language. Such negative connotations 
certainly does not help to look at soil as something to be valorised and 
protected; the association of soil with graves, burials or Hell also doesn’t 
encourage a positive relationship between man and soils.
Moreover, it should be acknowledged that soil’s lack of specific 
identity, when dealing with landscape themes is grounded in the inter-
changeable use of the terms land and soil which are often considered as 
synonymous. The term land contains the concept of soil; in this way soil 
is deprived of its individual identity and policy makers are excused from 
focusing on soil specific issues and regulations. A practical example can 
be found in the list of the ten criteria to be met by eligible sites for the 
World Heritage Sites status (UNESCO, 2005 ), where the term “soil” is 
never mentioned despite being conceptually and obviously embedded 
in, at least, six of them such as landform, natural habitat, terrestrial 
ecosystem, natural areas etc. (Costantini, 2023 ). Another example is the 
already mentioned list of the SDGs discussed in the previous paragraph.
Many soil definitions use the term surface of the planet or skin of the 
earth. From an ecological perspective it is correct to consider soil as the 
interface through which fluxes of energy and matter move back and 
forth through the different ecospheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, hy-
drosphere, biosphere). In this case soil is conceived of as a two- 
dimensional entity that marks the border between the aboveground 
and belowground systems. However, when dealing with the many 
functions soils perform, a three-dimensional perspective is necessary 
where soil depth plays a fundamental role in providing plant rooting, 
favouring water infiltration, allowing carbon storage, supplying biodi -
versity niches etc. Therefore, the term depth or an additional dimension 
such as thickness should be considered when describing and defining 
soils.
An additional crucial question lies in the term resource. In the present 
era, characterized by an economistic-productivistic view, the term itself 
embeds the attitude of exploitation. Soil is considered a productive 
factor used to satisfy our necessities and, due to this designated role, 
humans feel authorized to use/abuse it. “A resource for value extraction 
and a recalcitrant object of scientific inquiry” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ).
To this purpose, rather than “resource” the term “matrix” could better 
fit the aim of soil identification as the source of life. Additionally, from 
an ecological perspective, together with air and water, soil is one of the 
environmental matrices constituting the natural environment and the 
landscape.
The last semantic issue that is worth considering is the adoption of 
the term “soil ecosystem services” instead of “soil functions” 
(Evangelista et al., 2023 ; Baveye et al., 2016 ). Again, the term service - 
accused of embodying an anthropocentric attitude - considers soil 
functions and attributes solely in view of the benefits that it secures to 
mankind. According to Cardona (2012) the concept of service allows the 
perpetuation of attitudes that led to our current state of environmental 
degradation. Minami (2009) claims that “humans and the soil are linked in 
a completely utilitarian relationship, with humans taking no responsibility for 
the soil. A host of environmental problems have resulted from this lack of M.C. Moscatelli and S. Marinari                                                                                                                                                                                                            Soil Security  16 (2024)  100167

responsibility ”. Leopold (1949) mentioned soil abuse as linked to the 
concept of a commodity for humans.
The term soil functions seems therefore to encompass human needs 
and consider services from soils to nature itself.
A valorisation process of soil should, thus, begin by a re-definition of 
this environmental matrix specifically from the semantic point of view 
to re-establish its identity, to focus on its precious role and to guarantee 
its original dignity. Very recently, Hartemink and Mc Bratney (2024)
proposed in a short article a new paradigm of soil in two definitions (a 
shorter and a longer one) that aim to describe as much about soil using 
concise and clear terminology to be understood by a wider public and to 
fulfill the connectivity dimension of the soil security concept.
4.Soil and ethics
Soil identity may be reinforced only if an ethical shift in perspective 
is undertaken. Puig della Bellacasa (2015) claims that the close linking 
of soil science with a techno-scientific viewpoint should be undone to 
restore soil to its original dignity. There is a need to shift from an 
instrumental view of soil’s value, (as embodied by the concept of 
“ecosystem services ”), to an ecocentric view focused on soil’s intrinsic 
value. This would imply the re-establishment of a “soil ethics ” 
(Thompson, 2011 ), that can be attained through a social and cultural (r) 
evolution. Again, the social dimension of the soil security concept – 
connectivity - perfectly fits this desirable goal.
The ecocentric view places man “within ” the ecosystem at the same 
level as other components, while with the anthropocentric attitude 
humans are somehow outside of the system.
This dual perspective had already been emphasized when the con-
cepts of soil quality and health were developed in the ‘90 s (Doran and 
Parkin, 1996 ; Doran and Safley 1997 ). While soil quality was defined in 
relation to the intended use of soil selected by man, the health concept 
captures its ecological attributes which have implications beyond its 
quality or capacity to produce a particular crop.
The ethical relationship between soil and humans should also be 
discussed as regards the dependence of food security from soil conser -
vation (van Mansvelt et al. 2021 ). As an example, due to the gradual 
historical disenfranchisement of mankind from soil, the collective 
imagination lost the connection between food and soil. The root of our 
livelihood derives directly from soil but humans have lost this percep -
tion (Pepper, 2013 ). This last author, in fact, stress the soil 
health-human health nexus which is no more perceived making it 
difficult to conceive that threats to soil may ultimately affect human 
well-being (Brevik et al., 2017 ).
A valuable and effective approach to explore and re-establish a 
relation between man and soil is the book Soil and Culture (Landa and 
Feller, 2009 ). It explores the perception of soil across different societies 
(from the antique to the modern ones). It also encompasses all sorts of 
visual arts (painting, textiles, sculpture, architecture, film and comics), 
literary arts (prose, and poetry), religion, philosophy, anthropology, 
archaeology, stamp-design and, ultimately, wine production. Soil and 
culture provides, therefore, a wider view of human perception of the soil 
and ways in which man relates to soils enriched with new perspectives 
aimed to encourage outreach to the broader community, to think about 
soils on various levels of discussion.
Therefore, soil ethics, in its different guises, either philosophical- 
naturalistic, spiritual and religious (Lal, 2024 ) or generally cultural 
should be considered, reviewed, and discussed with the aim of 
improving the tight interrelationship between mankind and this natural 
resource.
5.New languages to approach soil
To promote general soil awareness requires, at first, the adoption of 
communications tools other than those commonly used within soil sci-
ence to reach a wider public.The tools of science are unavoidably and limitedly used within sci-
entific societies and/or academic environments. They require an 
objective attitude, a high level of specialization (Mol and Keesstra, 
2012 ) and the use of a conventional language necessary to describe and 
discuss data from the quantitatively point of view. For these reasons, the 
language of science is unquestionably not suitable for a broad audience 
or, in the main, to be used with policy makers. Paradoxically, in most 
cases it has been shown that “scientific talking ” may produce exactly the 
opposite result to that intended, leading to largely diffused 
non-respectful attitudes even among policy makers.
A connection of soil science to society is a major challenge as invoked 
by Richer-de-Forges et al. (2019) . In a special number of the journal 
˘Etude et gestions de sols these authors gathered articles dealing with a 
great number of activities performed with the aim to communicate soil. 
Some approaches were deliberately aimed at the very young, through 
educational schemes including playful aspects and were aimed primarily 
at schoolchildren. Others were aimed more broadly at the general 
public, such as descriptions of soil exhibitions or events, discoveries and 
awareness-raising tools.
A change of perspective and language is therefore imperative if a 
wider public is to be reached with the aim of raising soil awareness and 
increasing soil literacy. A first important step in this direction has been 
the recognition of soil as cultural heritage (Costantini and l’Abate, 2009 ; 
Costantini 2023 ). The association of the term soil with those of culture 
and heritage represents an important pillar towards promoting a positive 
attitude towards soil. Aspects that should characterize eligible heritage 
sites such as historical/archeological, aestethical and anthro -
pological/ethnological value have proven to be helpful in highlighting 
soil heritage. The new perspective and definition in which the concept of 
cultural heritage has recently evolved, enables to include the natural 
environment, such as soil sites and soilscapes and their cultural value 
(Vecco et al., 2010 ; Moscatelli et al., 2011 ; Costantini, 2023 ).
6.Soil and art
Art, in all its forms of expression, is a promising and effective com-
munications vehicle; in fact, according to Lazzari and Schlieser (2015) , 
art is “a primarily visual medium that is used to express ideas about our 
human experience and the world around us”. Visual arts have been 
demonstrated to function as ways of communicating important issues (e. 
g. cultural, political, environmental, societal etc.) with the aim of 
generating awareness in wider society (Perumal and Sharjii, 2012 ).
Kurt (2003) , in a play on words, contrasted two entities: science, as 
Wissenschaft, (literally “the making of knowledge ”), and art, Wissens -
form (literally “the form of knowledge ”). Kurt stated that one is defi-
nitely the counterpart of the other in the pursuit of a complete 
understanding of nature (Toland and Wessoleck, 2010 ). While science is 
compelled to describe nature through a rationale/objective approach 
using standardized rigid languages and tools, art, conversely, requires an 
unavoidably subjective attitude, filtered through human emotions and 
perceptions, to communicate nature and its various expressions.
Therefore, visual communication shows a great potential and may 
prove a helpful vehicle for knowledge where oral communication fails, 
whether a result of linguistic barriers or just because complex concepts 
are more easily and rapidly spread visually than orally (Stenchly et al., 
2019 ).
In the “global arena of image-based communication ” (Pente, 2010 ) 
soil contents may benefit from an extraordinarily effective instrument to 
spread knowledge and raise awareness about their complexity, dyna-
mism, symbolic and cultural dimensions.
Artists can, in fact, assist and complement the work of soil scientists 
in the dissemination of a soil culture increasing the spheres of action of 
scientific investigation by adding unusual and innovative forms of vi-
sual, symbolic and cultural representation of soil.
Taking into consideration the difficulties in focusing on the real 
nature of soil due to the various obstacles that have been deeply M.C. Moscatelli and S. Marinari                                                                                                                                                                                                            Soil Security  16 (2024)  100167

analysed in the previous paragraphs, visual arts represent a promising 
and effective instrument through which to communicate and improve 
soil literacy. From prehistoric paintings to the most recent contemporary 
forms of art including installations, soil has necessarily been considered, 
either directly or indirectly, as the surface on which a scene and/or 
characters were displayed. However, until the first half of the XX cen-
tury, apart from very rare examples, soil can be hardly observed in the 
foreground of a painting represented per se with its typical features. 
These exceptions regard scenes related to agricultural practices and 
rural life, mythology and allegories, burials and/or hell scenes (Jenny, 
1968 ; Feller et al., 2015 ). To this purpose, these authors provide a 
comprehensive and well documented list of examples ranging from 
medieval art to the most recent contemporary artworks highlighting 
how soil perception and representation as a natural matrix, integral part 
of the landscape, has changed across centuries. In fact, from being 
represented as a mere straight line, sometimes even colourless display -
ing neither three-dimensionality nor life, soil awareness among artists 
increased over time leading to the artistic movement known as Soil art. 
Soil art, proposed by Toland and Wessolek (2010) , was defined as an 
“artistic work about, in, or with soil or soil protection issues, that is produced 
by artists in a multitude of genres and media, to be understood, among other 
things, as artwork that may contribute to wider environmental and soil 
protection and awareness-raising discourses .” From the above authors an 
important contribution to this discussion is the book “Field to Palette: 
Dialogues on Soil and Art in the Anthropocene ” (Toland et al., 2018 ) 
where many examples of visual methodologies help understanding of 
the “gound beneath our feet”.
Interestingly, many of these soil artists are also soil scientists con-
firming how researchers themselves are the first to perceive the obsta -
cles that scientific language poses in conveying the demands of soil. 
Therefore, they invoke, and propose at the same time, different 
communication systems to talk about soil properties and current issues. 
Some of these researchers and their effective artworks are Ken van Rees 
(https://www.kenvanrees.com/soil-art.html ), J.S. Noller and G. Wes-
solek. Above all, mention should be made to G. Wessolek, pioneer of the 
soil-art relationship, who already in 2002 introduced the need to convey 
the demands of soil through artistic language by introducing the concept 
of soil aesthetics through his own paintings of soil profiles (Wessolek, 
2022 ).
Focusing on contemporary art, Feller et al. (2015) provide some 
successful examples of installation/immersive art that introduce a 
three-dimensional aspect combined with a sensory experience that 
constitute an added value to the traditional fields of vision.
Among these, New York earth room (Walter De Maria 1977, 
https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/walter-de-maria 
-the-new-york-earth-room-new-york-united-states/ ) and You (Urs Fischer 
2007, https://www.jasonhaam.com/artists/65-urs-fischer/works/550-urs 
-fischer-you-2007/ ) transferred the physical experience of land art 
within the indoor, familiar space of a museum. Courageously, both 
artists literally brought the soil into a room although antithetically: the 
first one deposited about 200 m3 of soil in a museum room while the 
second one excavated a huge crater about 12 ×9 ×3 m removing the art 
gallery ’s floor. In both cases, the visitor is granted a physical experience 
with soil even along its profile depth. In this way, the artists, by placing 
dirt within a museum room, elevated soil to the status of an artwork per 
se, ascribing to it an immaterial value.
A similar, but more recent and interactive, example is the large-scale 
project, Absorption/Plot by the american artist Asad Raza (https://www. 
youtube.com/watch?v mGvu64b3CEM ; https://youtu.be/QsgEIG7SuE 
4). Artists, performers, architects, students, community gardeners, cul-
tivators and visitors work and interact in a metabolically active instal -
lation where tons of soil up to a meter in depth fill the space (Museion, 
Bolzano, Italy for Plot or Kaldor Public Art Projects, Sydney, Australia). 
The project is a dialogue between visual art, science, architecture, dance 
and local participants linked by a strong relationship with soil.
Koichi Kurita, a Japanese artist collected French soils, across twenty- eight departments bordering the Loire Valley from its source to the es-
tuary. In his artwork, Bibioth ˇeque de Terre/Loire , (presented at the 
exhibition Jardins, Grand Palais, Paris in 2017) 400 soil samples were 
displayed on the ground, on squares of paper, in a simplicity that echoes 
Zen philosophy: according to Kurita, ‘everything comes from the earth 
and everything will return to the earth ’. Furthermore, the different soil 
colors and granulometry provide a good example of pedodiversity 
(https://spectacles-selection. 
com/archives/expositions/fiche_expo_J/jardins-V/jardins-P.html ).
Among the many recent artworks aiming to raise soil awareness, and 
become popular through the social media, the Instagram account won-
derofsoil (https://www.instagram.com/wonderofsoil?igsh ZWI2YzEzY 
mMxYg, dr. Y. Pressler) effectively communicates, for example, the 
pedodiversity concept. The 12 orders of soil taxonomy are simple 
sketches, a one-line drawing moving from the bottom to the upper level 
of each soil profile. The continuity of the line informs the viewer that 
each soil is a unique entity, the final product of a series of pedogenetic 
processes where each of them (addition, transformation, translocation 
and loss) are clearly drawn and represented by a diverse movement of 
the line. No definitions are necessary to inform about soils diversity, 
pedogenetic processes and three-dimensional properties. Furthermore, 
the short title for these sketches “good things take time to develop ” in-
troduces the time component informing on the length of soil forming 
process. Six words and a line: a successful synthesis of the basic features 
of pedogenesis and soils diversity.
Always within Instagram platform, another interesting account is 
The art of soil (https://www.instagram.com/theartofsoil?igsh MWQ1ZG 
UxMzBkMA, by Karen Vaughan) where soils and earth pigments 
are used to craft soil-based watercolours. Paintings, videos and DIY 
reels, complete the account providing a further didactic function vehi-
culating soils properties and their esthetic value.
A peculiar way to combine soil science with soil art was represented 
by the project Tripmarks (https://tripmarks.at/?page_id 1471 ) through 
the form of a cycling trip. In the year 2012, the artist Wolfgang Burtscher 
started a bicycle tour through 17 countries documenting the diversity of 
soils. This was achieved by daily ‘signing ’ with the dirty bike tires a great 
number of paper sheets which were further used for an art exhibition. 
Moreover, a scientific investigation carried out at Innsbruck University ’s 
Institute of Microbiology (Austria), under the supervision of prof. H. 
Insam, on the different soil samples collected, assessed changes in the 
genetic diversity of microbial community along the travelled path.
Within the land art movement, the ephemeral artworks of Strijdom 
Wan Der Merve, an african artist, (https://www.strijdom.com/land-art/
) deal mostly with soil, highlighting its hidden localization (the rolled-up 
lawn is an effective example), its composition, the dry crust originated 
by arid climate, the various soil colours, the close relationship of soil 
with rocks.
Nice and simple infographics are routinely used by FAO; in 2015, to 
celebrate the International Year of Soils, a very impressive and effective 
infographic clearly showing the origins of food (https://www.fao.org/ 
documents/card/en/c/ffa480bd-2b3c-476c-a01b-da5bcd43aee7 ) was 
released with the aim to highlight the close relationship between soil 
and food.
In conclusion, transdisciplinary integration, as also underlined by 
Toland (2016) , between soil science and art is necessary if awareness of 
the importance of soil is to be rapidly and effectively vehiculated.
The use of alternative communications tools such as videos/reel, 
photos, posters, comics, drawings, exhibitions, recently started being 
adopted by most scientific societies of soil science (IUSS, International 
Union of Soil Sciences and SISS, Italian Society of Soil Science) or those 
dealing with soil (FAO) through various social media platforms. During 
the recent Centennial of the International Union of Soil Sciences, held in 
Florence, Italy, May 2024, a side event entitled “The Soil Dialogues ” 
consisted in an exhibition bringing together artists from around the 
world presenting ways in which they are addressing the multiple crises 
facing soils.M.C. Moscatelli and S. Marinari                                                                                                                                                                                                            Soil Security  16 (2024)  100167

Apart from policy makers, whom these new ways of communicating 
soils are specifically addressed, another important target audience is 
represented by the younger generations, either as they are used to quick 
and easy communications tools or, ultimately, because they represent 
the real objective to which the message of soil protection is addressed. A 
survey, undertaken among high school students, reported a weak 
knowledge of soil’s intrinsic features and serious difficulties in recog -
nizing the precious soil functions including even the most obvious as its 
role as a source of food (Moscatelli et al., 2019 ). As reported by other 
authors (Tavin and Hausman, 2004; Chung and Kirkby, 2009) all visual 
cultural forms are sites of ideological struggles and embodiments of 
social reality. An integrative pedagogical field such as critical media 
literacy art education proposes ways to raise social awareness and start 
possible changes through art among young generation (Chung and 
Kirkby, 2009). A further call for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary 
approaches has been recently invoked by Wessolek and Toland (2024)
who stated that collaboration between soil scientists, artists, cultural 
agents and science communicators is imperative to revitalize educa -
tional processes.
7.Conclusions
A shift of perspective, attitude and language is necessary if soil lit-
eracy is to be spread and awareness raised about its fragile status. This 
can be achieved, across a broad audience, through language and com-
munications tools other than the technical-scientific ones sensu stricto . 
Different branches of human sciences play a central role in effective 
communication of scientific issues because they hit the emotional, sen-
sitive, spiritual side of humans going beyond the conventional language 
of science that is almost unknown to the broader public. Art and art-
works, in particular, talking through images, are the best candidates and 
show great potential to attract attention towards the soil resource 
bypassing technical language. Visual arts in general are the best candi -
dates to reach a broader public and, most importantly, younger gener -
ations who will be in charge of soil management and protection in the 
near future.
