ABSTRACT
We o ﬀer an argument for why responsible research and innovation
should be in conversation with multispecies studies. We suggest
that RRI can learn from multispecies studies to expand de ﬁnitions
of stakeholders and responsibilities, thereby including othercreatures in conversations and frameworks where they arecurrently missing. In addition, the RRI community might bene ﬁt
from exploring conceptual overlaps between RRI andmultispecies studies literatures. For example, concepts germaneto RRI –notably, care and relationality –have been particularly
well-developed with respect to how they oblige mutuallyresponsive relationships. Consequently, connecting these two
areas of theory and practice should nuance discussions about
responsibility as an individual versus a collective endeavor andabout the relationship between RRI and knowledge production.ARTICLE HISTORY

Responsible research and innovation (RRI) and multispecies studies scholarship rarely
intersect. We think that should change. RRI has gained ground in Europe and beyond
through observing that scienti ﬁc and technological research needs to account for societal
goods and diverse values, de ﬁned in terms such as ‘ensuring that research outcomes are
both desirable and acceptable for society ’(McLeod and Hartley 2018 ; see also Lindner
et al. 2016 ). However, society is generally de ﬁned (explicitly or implicitly) as human
society, indicating that research and innovation processes must be responsible to the
interests of human stakeholders. RRI frameworks encourage researchers to consider
the motivations driving their research, to re ﬂect on who might be a ﬀected, and to
engage stakeholders in dialogue (Stilgoe et al. 2013 )–expectations predicated on
human stakeholders and human concerns.
The concomitant lack of attention to other-than-human creatures is notable because
human wellbeing is necessarily interdependent with other creatures ’wellbeing, because
other creatures are often involved in research, and because RRI draws from conceptual-
izations of responsibility that foreground more-than-human relations (Haraway 2007 ;
Pellizzoni 2004 ). Restricting ‘society ’to humans alone is a relatively recent notion, and

a limitation in considering how science and technology might be oriented toward better
futures (Latimer and Miele 2013 ). We suggest that RRI can learn from multispecies
studies to expand de ﬁnitions of stakeholders and responsibilities, thereby including
other creatures in conversations and frameworks where they are currently missing. In
addition, the RRI community might beneﬁ t from exploring conceptual overlaps
between RRI and multispecies studies literatures.
Cultural studies of non-humans –often ‘animal studies, ’but also studies of plants and
microorganisms –have steadily become more interested in how other creatures and
humans relate than what they are. This relational focus, examining meetings among
species rather than species as abstractions, avoids essentializing non-humans ’otherness
and mitigates tendencies to make assumptions about non-humans ’capabilities. This
approach also demonstrates how humans and non-humans co-constitute their identitiesin relation (van Dooren 2016 ) and how caring for human wellbeing thus necessitates
caring for the wellbeing of other species (Puig de la Bellacasa 2015 ). Multispecies
studies, in other words, brings attention to how worlds inhabited by myriad creaturesare actively constituted through mutual response. These lines of inquiry lead multispeciesstudies to intersect with what it means for research to be responsible, and to advance RRIagendas, in several ways.
First, we might ask what it means to be responsible to other creatures as stakeholders
in human-driven research. Future worlds are not just inhabited by humans. How mayinnovations change the lives of living things, broadly understood? How can research pro-
cesses ensure that diverse needs and interests are considered? These questions are similar
to those invoked in conventional RRI –about how to direct research toward a better
world, acknowledging that ‘better ’is never equally better for everyone –but with a sub-
stantially expanded de ﬁnition of ‘everyone. ’The essential question in multispecies RRI
therefore becomes: what methods do we need to engage (non-human) others in dialogue,or to otherwise take their perspectives into account?
The di ﬃculty of bringing other creatures into RRI practices –without simply speaking
for them –brings us to a second intersection. Following Stengers ( 1997 ) and Haraway
(2007 ,2016 ), we need to ask how humans are response-able to other creatures, that is,
how we become able to respond to each other. Their arguments, echoed by many multi-
species scholars, indicate that humans must deliberately cultivate capacities to attend to
and communicate with other creatures. In the absence of such response-abilities with
other creatures, humans have no hope of being responsible toother creatures because
we do not know how to listen; the stakeholder voices we hear will only ever be ourown, speaking forothers, and limiting possibilities to learn from and account for perspec-
tives we might not already imagine. Developing such response-abilities might enable RRI
to encompass how to care fororganisms produced through science and innovation
(Wickson 2016 ), how to care with creatures through scienti ﬁc work in which they par-
ticipate (Szymanski and Calvert 2018 ), and how to care about technoscienti ﬁc
 futures
in more-than-human ways (McLeod and Hartley 2018 ).
Several concepts germane to both RRI and multispecies research are well-developed in
the rich multispecies literature, including care, concern, and relationality. Care is multi-
faceted and contested, but we ﬂag it here because it is central to RRI, as in Stilgoe et al. ’s
(2013 )d eﬁnition of RRI as ‘taking care of the future through collective stewardship of
science and innovation in the present. ’Davies and Horst ( 2015 ) also found that when262 E. A. SZYMANSKI ET AL.
discussing RRI, research group leaders understood care for their group (sometimes also
including research animals) as primary among their responsibilities. RRI implemen-
tation, however, has been criticized for not accounting for the complexities of care inpractice (Kerr et al. 2018 ; Viseu 2015 )–an absence complemented by multispecies
studies, wherein care has been operationalized as a tool for situated work (e.g. Abrahams-
son and Bertoni 2014 ; Donati 2019 ). Care, as a concept, has been debated in many
diﬀerent ﬁelds and cannot be reduced to a single analytic or a recipe. Connecting RRI
and multispecies studies around care should open up space for scholars in both ﬁelds
to take seriously what care can mean and might do.
Care recalls a central principle of RRI, that re ﬂexivity and dialogue must be respon-
sive, open to interruption and change through relationships developed over time.What multispecies studies brings along with this shared focus on responsiveness is
that these relationships are about generating knowledge –about ‘the research itself ’–
in addition to how that knowledge works in broader social spaces. Multispecies theorists
such as Despret ( 2004 ,2013 ,2015 ) and Candea ( 2013 ) have demonstrated that research-
ers who oblige themselves to listen and respond to non-humans, as partners in inquiry,
inquire more openly; by working to generate shared concerns with these partners, theyremain open to being surprised by them. While such case studies have typically focused
on charismatic animals, we have observed similarly productive research participation by
baker ’s yeast (Calvert and Szymanski 2020 ; Szymanski and Calvert 2018 ), and Beth
Greenhough ( 2012 ) has suggested that common cold viruses and humans have partici-
pated in similar relationships. Multispecies case studies thus vividly demonstrate thatRRI cannot be separated from ‘the research itself ’because responsiveness changes the
shape of knowledge construction and constructs ethical obligations simultaneously.
Rather than polluting or impeding research, on the contrary, responsive relationships
should enable more attentive, nuanced ﬁndings.
Considering RRI in multispecies terms should consequently also advance conversa-
tions about tensions between individual and collective responsibilities through juxtapos-
ing responsibility and response-ability. Response-ability –Haraway ’s(2016 ) neologism
for the capacity of creatures to notice, attend to, and respond to each other –is a necess-
ary predicate of responsibility. Haraway ( 2007 ,2016 ), Stengers ( 2010 ,2011 ), Despret
(2004 ,2015 ), Puig de la Bellacasa ( 2011 ), and other feminist multispecies researchers
have observed that response-ability, as the capacity for ‘attunement and productive
mutual modi ﬁcation, ’is
 always reciprocal (Despret 2004 ); researchers become
response-able with the systems they study –with, not to. Bringing response-able research
into contact with responsible research makes it possible to refocus conversations about
individual versus collective responsibility; instead of talking about people who need to
be responsible, we need to talk about mutually obliging relationships that make respon-
sibility possible.
Multispecies studies perspectives highlight that responsibility is essentially relational
and aﬀective, and always in excess of what is captured in metrics that distance responsible
actions from personal entanglements. These perspectives should therefore also illuminateinstances in which response-ability does not seem possible, and help identify conditionsthat hinder it. Institutions may structurally elide or even systematically eliminate respon-
sive capacities in ways that are more or less calci ﬁed and resistant to change. And while it
is not possible to be response-able to all stakeholder-creatures at all times, addressingJOURNAL OF RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION 263
multispecies responsibilities is a matter of seeing and consciously addressing such ten-
sions, not feigning that they do not exist.
This is a very di ﬀerent path to multispecies responsibility than one guided by frame-
works governing the use of animals in research (McLeod and Hartley 2018 ). The ‘3Rs ’
central in those frameworks –replacement, reduction, re ﬁnement –apply only to
animals (usually creatures understood to feel pain) directly involved in research (Kirk
2018 ). Moreover, laboratory animal welfare and multispecies research are concerned
with di ﬀerent central tensions. In the former, researchers negotiate con ﬂicts between
commitments to animal wellbeing and to the value of research, often by caring as wellas possible for their animals given the needs of their research (e.g. Giraud and Hollin2016 ). In the latter, researchers negotiate con ﬂicts between the need for all beings to
dwell on this planet and the priority that human beings give to each other, dealingwith how we choose to live well together (Haraway 2016 )–whom we prioritize when,
practically speaking, we cannot care for everyone equally all the time. Where laboratory
animal governance emphasizes animal su ﬀering and minimizing negative multispecies
relations, multispecies studies perspectives instead tend to orient around cultivating posi-
tive relations.
Public engagement and science policy scholars have taken decades to establish strat-
egies for being response-able with human publics. Leveraging the multispecies studies lit-erature may suggest methods for helping multispecies RRI catch up. An integratedmultispecies RRI, in which care for future worlds through stewardship of research in
the present accounts for how human wellbeing is always about the wellbeing of
humans and non-humans together, is no doubt very far o ﬀ. However, RRI stands to
beneﬁt from engaging with multispecies studies now, as we continue to work to
expand the scope of consideration of those whose futures matter.
