To be more-than-human is to be relational, to no longer see the human as a dis-
crete individual and to recognise the multivalent agency and import of the non-
human in bio-physical, socio-economic and cultural worlds. This Special Issue
galvanises an interest by Aotearoa New Zealand geographers in non-human –
human relations and delivers more-than-human research from the edges: of
the discipline, from our geographic position antipodal to ‘the west ’and ‘the
north ’, from early career researchers and from cognate literatures at the periph-
ery of geographic thought. The contributions here question understandings of
ethics, politics, conservation and economy through papers that explore affect,
care, agency, discourses and practices with a range of more-than-human
subject-objects: blackberries, wine yeasts, insects, PFAS and urban streams.

1|INTRODUCTION
Recent research into topics like rewilding, the role of the
microbiome in human ecosystems and the agency of ‘the
natural world ’reveals interesting theoretical questions
about the role and politics of more-than-human (MTH)
relations in geographic thought. What does this mean in
times of crisis? What does it mean for the relations wehold, and who are ‘we’in these relations? Does this
framing actually challenge notions of anthropocentrism
and human exceptionalism? This Special Issue presentsinsights into a suite of Antipodean more-than-human
geographies from the vantage point of MTH scholars ‘on
the edges ’of the discipline: from our geographic position
antipodal to ‘the west ’and ‘the north ’, from early career
researchers and from cognate literatures at the periphery
of geographic thought. Work like that of Thomas (
2015 ),
Parsons et al. ( 2017 ), Yates ( 2021 ), Stevens et al. ( 2022 )and Sharp et al. ( 2022 ) indicates that there is a keen
interest from Aotearoa New Zealand geographers to
spark greater conversations around the ethical relations
between human and non-human others. This SpecialIssue is a convening point for these interests, bringingthem together in space and place.
This Special Issue evolved from a session on MTH
geographies at the 2022 New Zealand Geographical Soci-ety conference in /C22Otautahi Christchurch (22 –25 Novem-
ber) convened by the four guest editors. We build from
the momentum of that conference, featuring the work offour session participants. As guest editors, we are united
by a shared empirical interest in the MTH of food and
agriculture and an ethos of knowledge co-productionwith a lively Earth, as galvanised through the Critical
Food Studies Group in Te Kura M /C22atai Taiao jSchool of
Environment at Waipapa Taumata Rau jUniversity of
Auckland.Received: 3 July 2023 Accepted: 4 July 2023

2|THE MORE-THAN-HUMAN
The ‘more-than-human ’blurs the boundaries of the
animate and inanimate, the ‘natural ’and ‘cultural, ’com-
plex socio-ecological systems and individuals, non-human and human. The MTH approach is a political
project of disrupting ontological norms to highlight oft-
neglected, typically animate earth others (Braun &Castree,
1998 ; Greenhough, 2014 ). A MTH approach
denies human exceptionalism and refuses to ‘presume
that socio-material change is an exclusively humanachievement ’(Whatmore,
2006 , p. 604). By bringing
together diverse strands of post-humanist thought to
disturb dominant Cartesian-based boundaries around
humans as autonomous and separate from nature, itargues that there are no clear binaries between human –
nature relations (Ives,
2019 ; Rose & van Dooren, 2017 ;
Whatmore, 2004 ). In this way, we understand that
humans are entangled in a mosaic of interconnected net-
works with other non-human entities, recognising that
diversity, co-constitution and interdependency are foun-dational to planetary flourishing (Kimmerer,
2013 ; Sharp
et al., 2022 ). Many of these networks are banal. In fact, as
Whatmore ( 2004 , p. 1360) argues, ‘What gives the post-
human moment bite is the fact that mapping its emer-gence /C1/C1/C1is a diffuse activity. It is practised as much in
everyday negotiations with, say, foodstuffs and health-
care as in the generative spatial metaphors of the human-ities or the biocomputational models of the life sciences ’.
Much work in MTH geography has emphasised the mun-
dane, the everyday doings of human and non-humansthat are often unacknowledged.
One such underacknowledged and emergent arena of
MTH scholarship that is gaining interest is probiotic gov-
ernmentalities (Lorimer,
2020 ), a commitment to working
with nature particularly seen in conservation and human
health. While much of the theoretical interest in post-
Pasteurian (Paxson, 2008 ) or rewilding (Lorimer, 2020 )
politics is driven from the social sciences, this theorisa-
tion has emerged concurrently with changing western
conceptualisations of natural science (particularly inhuman microbiome research which shows the impor-
tance of microscopic others for human health, and in
ecological research which highlights keystones species asessential to conservation). This requires an engagement
across academic boundaries that geographers have been
well placed to lead.
Rather than entirely rejecting or uncritically reifying
science, MTH geographers have demonstrated their abil-
ity for ‘redistributing expertise ’(Whatmore,
2004 ,
p. 1362) and contesting as well as collaborating with thenatural sciences. On the matter of acknowledging diverse
expertise, MTH geographies also provide fertile groundswithin which decolonial scholarship advocating the
voices and agency of non-human actors (as ancestors, askin, as spiritual beings) within Indigenous Lifeworlds
(e.g., Williams,
2012 ) can flourish. The MTH knowledge
infrastructure —the thinking, doing and its assemblage —
thus holds promise for Indigenous researchers seeking to
‘radically rethink how we understand the world, what
we privilege within it, how we relate to place and time,and how we dogeography ’(Barker & Pickerill,
2020 ,
p. 655). This is explored further in McSherry and
McLellan's ( 2023 ) commentary included in this issue.
Another prevalent theme in current MTH discourse
that arises in this Special Issue is an MTH ethics of care,
where new value appears to manifest in spaces of affect
and care for MTH others. We see this explicitly in papersby Yee and Sharp (
2023 ) and by Goburdhone and
Dombroski ( 2023 ), both of which reflect a care-full atten-
tion to the minutiae of actors' movements and/or rela-tions through close affectively oriented engagement. This
prompts us to ask whether it is possible to study the
MTH at speed or from a distance. What are the place-based contexts under which care/affect might mesh with
the political project(s) of the MTH? Prompted by the con-
tributors in this Special Issue, the papers tease out AnnaTsing's proposition that ‘edges [can be] found in the mid-
dle of [dominant] formations as well as out-of-the-way
places ’(Tsing,
2015 , np). We propose that these edges
have the greatest potential for transformability for waysthat we as humans intend to be and are in the world.
These are sites where we cannot help but see the diver-
sity of MTH engagement.
3|CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE
ANTIPODES
The term ‘Antipodes ’is itself MTH. Directly translated to
mean ‘wrong footed ’, there is an immediate suggestion of
subversion in being located in the Antipodes. From a
global perspective, the Antipodes are constructed as
places ‘on the edge ’, seemingly distanced from an imag-
ined ‘centre ’(of knowledge production, of economic rele-
vance, of power) and thus often sidelined from dominant,
western scholarly discourse.
Yet as ‘edge dwellers ’in Antipodal places, our con-
tributors hold promise for experimentation and expan-
sion in terms of MTH praxis. Turning to the globalgeopolitical stage, Aotearoa New Zealand is uniquelyplaced. While we are institutionally recognised as a bicul-
tural nation with the necessary legal and political frame-
works in place for ongoing engagement in ethicaldecolonial relations, the current reality of M /C22aori-P /C22akeh /C22a
relations in Aotearoa are far from equitable. In this sense,60 COMMENTARY

we are very much still a settler-colonial state, and colo-
nialism persists despite having the politico-legal groundsfor change. In fact, anything short of genuine political
pushes for constitutional reform that restore and affirm
tino rangatiratanga for iwi and h /C22ap/C22u would be politically
disingenuous.
Having said this, MTH geographies do provide fruitful
opportunities for scholars to engage with decolonisationat multiple scales, as both Indigenous and Indigenous-
allied researchers (McSherry & McLellan,
2023 ;
Sundberg, 2014 ; Thomas, 2015 ). We therefore see MTH
geographies as potential spaces for the decolonial project,
ifcareful attention is paid to the structural realities
implicit within the academy. We say this because while
the burgeoning popularity of MTH geographies doesindeed do good work in terms of challenging eurocentric
nature–culture dualisms, the current landscape of MTH
geographies in the Antipodes (and beyond) neverthelesstends to perpetuate implicit colonialism by virtue of its
‘long, problematic relationship with colonial power ’
(Barker & Pickerill,
2020 , p. 640). Indigeneity thus con-
tinues to remain marginal, with Indigenous cosmologies
(epistemologies) often being denied academic legitimacy
within the discipline. With ongoing and renewed com-mitments to doing geography differently —that is, by tak-
ing seriously Indigenous ‘knowings ’,‘beings ’and
‘doings ’—there is hope and great potential for reform
and movement towards more just MTH worlds.
We therefore contend that the idea of the ‘Antipodes ’
is in need of problematising. Rather than being relegated
to the margins and edges of scholarly praxis, we see theinclusion of the fertile Antipodal terrain as essential to
the project of emergent MTH research. In this sense,
to echo the Ancient Greek philosopher Timaeus (Stewartet al.,
2017 ), we seek to replace the Antipodes, not situat-
ing it as ‘other ’, or even ‘wrong-footed ’, but delinking
the notion of ‘otherness ’from ‘violation ’and proposing
that the Antipodes are, in fact, a lively site of actuallyexisting ontological difference. Perhaps the Aotearoa
New Zealand experience of geographical scholarship is
an adaptation to both the western communities of thediscipline whilst being attentive and sensitive to settler-
colonial contexts and important Indigenising and anti-
colonising forces of the country. In this sense, to beAntipodal is not to be wrong footed —where both feet are
elsewhere —but to be here and there. This framing sees
the Antipodes as a relation rather than a place and doesnot argue for national exceptionalism (Beilharz,
2002 ).
As Morgan and Lewis ( 2020 , p. 161) argue, ‘in Aotearoa/
New Zealand we can no longer assume that there are
easy answers to the questions of “who we are ”and “what
is here ”’. Rather, we see the Antipodes and Aotearoa
New Zealand as MTH actors in their own right, onesdeeply entangled with the knowledge-making practices
of their relations.
The papers in this Special Issue, as intentionally
assembled, are Antipodean in production, in origin, in
p l a c ea n ds p a c ea n di nt h e i rp o l i t i c s .T h e ya r ea l ld i s r u p -tive in their own way, seeking to decentre anthropocen-
tric thinking and doing. As a disruption to what
is performed as conventional knowledge ‘expertise ’,
each paper has been first authored by early career
researchers —postgraduate geographers in the main —
based on their primary research. Furthermore, the casestudies in the Special Issue are drawn from the geo-graphic peripheries; Aotearoa New Zealand is often a
location left out in global cartography and scholars from
this part of the world are sometimes under-recognised.From these margins, the unique angles of regard in
this issue demonstrate a mode of theorising that is
geographically distinctive and generative in pushing for-ward ways of thinking about the MTH —to bring them
out of the margins with respect to their agency, materi-
ality and relationality. Not only does this Special Issuedecentre dominant geography, but it performs Antipo-
dean practice.
4|SPECIAL ISSUE PAPERS
Our suite of five research papers and three commentar-
ies introduce a range of non-human actors as subject-
objects, place them in their geographical relations and
consider them as thinking points for diverse theory aswell as advancing MTH literatures. Typically, there is a
dominance of animal geographies in MTH scholarship,
w i t hap r e v a l e n c eo fr e s e a r c ho nn o n - h u m a n st h a ta r e‘big like us ’and ‘animal like us ’(Krzywoszynska,
2012 ;
Lorimer, 2014 ) where human-centredness still creeps
into MTH thinking. In this Special Issue, none of the
papers take charismatic animals as their subject-object.Instead we offer an antipodal antidote through the
neglected ontologies of weeds, yeasts, insects, chemicals
and urban streams. This brings us onto methodologicalconsiderations, as papers in this issue offer a diversity of
ways in which we might speak for the MTH. Just one

description of tactile, embodied encounters of soil that
speak to what have been undervalued and underused
multi-sensory renderings of the world.
The Special Issue begins with three papers that con-
tribute to understandings of affect theory and affective
MTH relationships. The first paper starts the issue on a
vegetal note. Virens ( 2023 ) composts the perceptions,
place and philosophy of weeds as settlers and as the
unsettled. The paper develops critical observations ofCOMMENTARY 61

weeds-as-settlers, and notes the colonial networks that
support their spatial travels. Using the example of theblackberry, Virens dives into questions of belonging and
inclusion, as well as the emotive responses that humans
can have towards non-humans. Throughout, her workattends to the slippage of seemingly stable categories with
a particular emphasis on the discursive construction of
weeds.
In thinking about different ways of living-with(in) a
MTH world, the next two papers help to draw out and
acquaint readers with other beings who are ostensiblyless ‘charismatic ’(Lorimer,
2007 ) than the ubiquitous
plants or megafauna of Aotearoa. Siimes ( 2023 ) goes
microscopic, building off a recent interest in STS
approaches and the social study of microbes. His paperferments on a particularly challenging wine and beer
yeast—Brettanomyces —that calls for reconceptualising
our understanding of taste and qualification. Through acultural approach to biological economies (Lewis &
Rosin,
2013 ), Siimes explores Brett as an agential cultural
and economic actant, offering a playful anthropomor-phism of Brett. Brett is an iconic Awkward (Lori-
mer,
2014 ) and thinking-with it reshapes what it means
for something to taste good . Siimes's paper contributes to
literature on MTH entanglements with microbes, as wellas the relational-social construction of taste.
Yee and Sharp's (
2023 ) paper then challenges domi-
nant understandings of insect agency by paying care-fullattention to the ways in which insects care for and with
humans. In taking up the task of caring more critically,
their paper reveals tensions and complexities that arisebetween insect needs and demands in the production of
insect bioeconomies. The juxtaposition in this paper
of insects that are bred to be eaten and those that arebred to eat is especially interesting. Given the growingbuzz around insects as human food, animal feed and bio-
control, Yee and Sharp's contributions to understandings
of insects as affective agents and as capable of reciprocalcare themselves are timely and provocative.
The final two papers shift from the living to the world
of‘objects ’, joining the rich thread of research (e.g. by
Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, & Jane Bennett) that
takes new materialist definitions of the MTH to recognise
the vitality and ability to animate of seemingly inanimateobjects/material/things. By questioning conventional
understandings of nature and highlighting the relational-
ities of the MTH world, these papers contribute to abroader reimagining of our ties with non-human othersand advocate for more inclusive and ecologically attuned
perspectives. Buttle et al. (
2023 ) explore the agency,
materiality and relationality of the global contaminantsof per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or ‘forever
chemicals ’. They ask what PFAS' ubiquity means forAotearoa New Zealand's regulatory and management
processes, considering both the chemical and receivingenvironments when framed as MTH. Their shift in fram-
ing means that regulation, policy and practice do not just
see land, water (and everything in between) as productivespaces in need of ‘saving ’for the furtherance of human
progress and prosperity, enabling a recognition of MTH
intrinsic rights to health.
The final paper in the issue animates the Waimapihi
stream as a case study, and documents the human –
environment relations of those involved in its restoration.Samuelson et al. (
2023 ) demonstrate how their partici-
pants (re)negotiate understandings of MTH agency along-
side their own identity and place-based politics. The
paper flows amongst growing efforts to reorient ourselvestowards building more ethical relationships in our every-
day encounters with urban streams. The authors assert
that at Waimapihi, humanstream relations are constantlyshifting and evolving, and cannot be reduced to stable
and universal abstractions. The paper similarly moves
conceptions of restoration past stale imaginations of anuntouched nature out there through an emphasis on how
plural ontologies of the stream are formed and them-
selves form social processes.
Following these research papers, we then have three
commentaries. The first explores the intersection of MTH
geographies and decolonial research. McSherry and
McLellan (
2023) draw on Indigenous kinship to suggest
that doing MTH geographical research —as emergent
Indigenous researchers (Alice, Naxi-Indigenous Chinese/
P/C22akeh /C22a and Georgia, M /C22aori-Te Whakat /C22ohea) is akin to
attending a family reunion with long-lost kin. In doing so,
they posit that re-engaging in Indigenous and decolonial
MTH geographies is to explicitly frame MTH scholarshipas a mutual process of recovery and remembrance(as opposed to the ‘discovery ’of new onto-epistemologies).
Together, they re-envision the project of coming back to a
relational praxis in research as living and breathing theirancestral ecological wisdom in an unbroken spiral of time
alongside their non-human kin. They use the metaphor of
attending a family reunion to invite other researchers tojoin them at the table, to collectively unsettle and chal-
lenge the core ontological foundations of the discipline.
Goburdhone and Dombroski (
2023) then explore the
possibilities that urban farms offer to reconnect people
with their food systems. Both authors conducted fieldwork
at the same urban youth farm in /C22Otautahi Christchurch,
and they reflect on the healing effects of MTH ecologieson the young people who took part. They contribute to a
growing MTH interest in soil (e.g., Krzywoszynska &
Marchesi,
2020; Wing & Sharp, 2023), and one that lends
credence to accounts of attunement and thinking-with.
Through their research into the practices of compositing62 COMMENTARY

food waste into soils, they question concepts of care, where
caring for or about soils become caring with soils. In short,
their commentary offers a hopeful path towards healing
social and nutrient metabolic rifts.
The final commentary offers an afterword to our col-
lection, reflecting on two key terms from MTH dialogues:
‘community ’and ‘local ’. This case study from Norway is
antipodal to examples and thinking from AotearoaNew Zealand, to step the contributions outside our own
emplaced reflections. As Weber and Barron (
2023 ) point
out, while Aotearoa New Zealand and Norway are simi-larly small and ‘edgy ’, their colonial and Indigenous his-
tories differ vastly. Inspired by Indigenous ways of
knowing, the authors extend the notion of community to
include non-humans, with clear implications for sustain-ability, place-making and politics. From Norway, they
offer an integration of localness, community and rela-
tions as they pertain to place, proposing ‘learning to be
emplaced in community ’as a re-turning of Latourian
learning to be affected.
5|CLOSING: OPENING A
CONVERSATION
Given the eight contributions to this Special Issue, what
can we say of an Antipodean MTH Geography? Does such
a discipline exist? Is Aotearoa New Zealand part of theGlobal South, the Global North, east or west, or are our
feet ‘here and there ’? What the papers in this collection
speak to is the value of research from this part of the worldas a basis from which to advance theory. We are not pre-
senting the Antipodes as an ‘essential place ’however, or
as one with a single culture or historical experience.Indeed, the label ‘Antipodean ’—with its geographic
specificity —avoids the generalisations that terms like the
‘Global South ’or‘Postcolonial ’often accompany.
Despite the large ground covered by the above contri-
butions, what is not highlighted in this Special Issue is
MTH aspects of technology, digital lives and virtual
worlds. While elements of these are seen in some of thepapers, there is room for more explicit work that takes
digital technology as a central MTH actor. And yet the
range of non-humans that are reckoned-with in theSpecial Issue papers offer fresh and generative under-
standings of MTH geography. As well as providing a
range of provocations to the ‘core ’of MTH theory, the
articles taken together offer a way forward for MTHthinking, one that attends to conceptions of place,
Indigeneity and relational ontologies that may not be as
visible from ‘the north ’and ‘the west ’. What these
papers achieve is the possibility for change. Perhaps our
Antipodean stance allows the onto-epistemological
freedom to put our best foot forward.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
