Abstract  
Based on the dynamic finite element theory, this paper establishes a fully coupled Mohr -Coulomb plastic finite element 
model of the soil ontology with the A metro station structure as the research object, conducts a nonlinear dynamic response 
analysis of t he model structure, studies the variation of the seismic response of the model under different vibrations, soil 
material parameters and concrete parameters, and analyzes the influence of the station structure form on the displacement. 
In EL -2 condition, th e first pair displacement of the S3 measurement point of the rectangular station is 5.695 mm, and the 
displacement of the arch-shaped station is 2.5 mm less than that of the rectangular station. The relative displacement of 
soil shear modulus with Gmax=200 MPa is 2.3 mm less than that of soil shear modulus with Gmax=80 MPa in the case 
of sidewall height of 3 m, which indicates that both the shape of station and soil stiffness has an effect on the seismic 
performance of the station. Influence on the seismic performance of the station. The research in this paper has an important 
reference value for the seismic design of underground frames of subway stations.

1 Introduction  
The subway station complex is moving from a single transportation station to an urban transportation 
hub complex that integrates transportation, commercial, residential, and entertainment fu nctions  [1-
2]. As an emerging architectural element introduced by cities in recent years, metro stations can be 
metro station complexes that can come to drive the development of surrounding plots, thus 
accelerating urban economic development and social activities [3-4]. Urban und erground structures 
are an important part of urban functions, and urban underground structures are characterized by 
complex structural forms, large spatial scales, safety hazards that are not easy to detect and difficult 
to repair, and are crucial for maintaining their safety and functions when strong earthqua kes come [5-
6]. Although subway stations as underground structures have better seismic performance than surface 
buildings, these structures are difficult to repair once damage occurs [7-8]. Moreover,  damage to 
subway stations can also cause damage to above -ground buildings and facilities, resulting in chain 
damage leading to major safety accidents [9-10]. 
Nowadays, the seismic study of subway station complexes is particularly important as more complex 
structures and involves many factors such as economic effects and human mobility [11]. The seismic 
response of the subway station complex structure is not only related to its own structural properties 
but also inv olves the dynamic interaction between the subway station -soil-adjacent underground 
structures  [12-13]. 
Miao et al. used the finite element software ABAQUS to develop a fully coupled model of the soil -
structure interaction system and analyzed the damage to the subway structure by different seismic 
waves [14]. The effect of the central column of a subway station on the seismic performance of the 
station was studied by Hou et al., and the results of his data support the idea that increasing the aspect 
ratio of the columns can improve the seismic performance of th e station [15]. Xu et al. studied the 
nonlinear d ynamic interaction of soil with subsurface structures in liquefied foundations and 
suggested that soil liquefaction attenuates the seismic performance of stations [16]. Liang et al. 
compared the differences in seismic response of subway stations between linear and nonlinear soils 
and between water -saturated and dry soils and suggested that the nonlinear and water -saturated soil 
states of soils have a direct impact on the seismic performance of subways [17]. Chen et al. proposed 
that the deeper the structure  is buried , the better the seismic performance of the subway station and 
that the soft soil structure has a weakening effect on the seismic resistance of the subway [18]. 
In this paper, we first study the process of implementing dynamic finite element analysis, discretize 
the structural solution domain, perform unit analysis and construct interpolation functions to construct 
the system dynamic equilibrium equations, and use  the implicit Newmark method to solve the 
dynamic equilibrium equations. Then, based on the finite element theory, the structure of the subway 
station is modeled, the Mohr -Coulomb plasticity model of the soil ontology is established, and the 
plastic damage  of concrete and the stress -strain relationship curve of concrete are analyzed by this 
model. Finally, the seismic performance of the underground frame structure of the subway station is 
analyzed, and the influence of the concrete strength and soil stiffne ss on the seismic performance of 
the underground frame structure of the station is investigated under different operating conditions.  
2 Dynamic finite element analysis  
2.1 Dynamic finite element  
The finite element method is currently the most effective SUSI analysis method. In the dynamic 
analysis of a structure using the finite element method, the action of the external load on the structure 
Optimal seismic solution design for underground frame structure of subway station considering uniform 
damage  3 
is always a function of time, and the function needs to be solved from the beginning of the input of 
the external load to the end of the process, so as to obtain the internal force and deformation of the 
structure at any moment. The basic idea of the dynamic finite element method is to discretize the 
solution domain of a structure or a continuum into several discrete units, and these discrete units are 
ordered in some form to form an aggregate instead of the original structure or continuum.  
The following are the steps of the dynamic finite element solution.  
1) Discretize the structure solution domain.  
2) Perform unit analysis and construct interpolation functions.  
3) Construct the system dynamic equilibrium equation.  
4) Introduce the boundary conditions.  
5) Solve the dynamic equations.

2.3 Solution of the dynamic equilibrium equation  
In solving SSI problems using the finite element method, there are usually two methods, showing the 
central difference method, and the implicit Newmark method. In this paper, the implicit Newmark 
method is used to solve the dynamic equilibrium equation, which is more suitable for analyzing a 
series of nonlinear dynamic problems. Its analytical principle is as follows.

3.2.1 Soil ontology Mohr -Coulomb plasticity model  
1) Mohr -Coulomb strength theory  
The Mohr -Coulomb plasticity model is based on the Mohr -Coulomb strength theory, assuming that 
the shear stress on the braking surface of the soil is affected by the normal stress on that surface and 
can be judged by the Mohr circle, and the expression of the shear strength of the soil is : 
 
tan c  =+  (14) 
Where  
 is the maximum shear stress that any section of the soil can withstand. 
c  is the cohesive 
force of the soil, 
  is the positive stress perpendicular to the soil section, and 
  is the angle of 
internal friction of the soil.  
The Mohr -Coulomb model yield surface function is given by : 
 
tan 0mc F R q p c  = − − =  (15) 
Where 
q  is the Mises deflection stress, 
23 qJ= . 
P  is the equivalent compressive stress, and 
1/ 3 ( ) P trac  =−

3.2.2 Concrete plastic damage  
Assuming that the main causes of damage suffered by concrete are tensile cracking and compressive 
crushing, it can be used to simulate the mechanical behavior of concrete under monotonic loading, 
cyclic loading and dynamic loading.

1) Uniaxial tensile and compressive behavior  
In concrete in uniaxial tension, when the stress is less than the failure stress 
0t , the material is in the 
linear elastic stage concrete modulus of elasticity is expressed by 
0E . When the stress reaches after 
0t
 for unloading, at this time , the elastic modulus of concrete degenerates to 
()0 1tdE− , where  
td 
is the concrete damage factor in tension, taking the value of 0 -1, 0 means no damage, 1 means 
completely damaged. Figure 3 shows the uniaxial tensile curve of concrete.

When concrete is compressed in one axis, the material is linearly elastic when the stress is less than 
the yield stress

0c  and the ultimate stress 
cu , the concrete 
enters the strengthening phase. When the stress exceeds 
cu , softening of the concrete occurs. When 
the stress reaches 
0c  for unloading, at this time , the elastic modulus of concrete degenerates to 
according to 
()0 1cdE− , where 
cd  is the damage factor of concrete under compression, taking a 
value of

2) Uniaxial cyclic loading  
Concrete under uniaxial cyclic loading, cracking and crack closure will occur, and the mechanical 
mechanism of concrete is more complex at this time. Under unidirectional loading, cracks begin to 
appear in the concrete , and its stiffness decreases. When reverse loading, the cracks close and the 
material stiffness is restored. In the CDP model, the damage factor 
d   is used to represent this 
mechanism of material stiffness degradation so that the relationship between the modulus of elasticity 
E
 and the initial modulus of elasticity 
0E  after material stiffness degradation can be expressed as : 
 
0 (1 )E d E=−  (21) 
Damage factor 
d   is jointly determined by tensile damage factor

Figure 5 shows the schematic diagram of the stiffness recovery of concrete under cyclic loading. 
When the material is in tension, the OA section is in the linear elastic stage, and the modulus of 
elasticity of the material is 
0E . After the peak tensile stress A point, the concrete starts to crack, and 
after loading to point B, it starts to unload, and the modulus of elasticity of the concrete is 
()0 1tdE− . 
When the material is loaded in the opposite direction, if the recovery factor of compressive stiffness 
is 
1cw= , the compressive stiffness is fully recovered, and the modulus of elasticity of the concrete 
is still 
0E  at this time, and the loading path CDN is continued to reach the point N for unloading, 
and the modulus of elasticity of the concrete is 
()0 1cdE−  at this time. When the load is reversed 
again, if the tensile stiffness recovery factor is 
0tw= , the tensile stiffness is damaged and the loading 
path changes along MG.

The EL -3 and EL -2 operating conditions are selected to compare the relative displacements of the top 
and bottom of the arched station and rectangular structure station models. According to the numerical 
simulation results, the displacement responses of the rectangular station model and the arched station 
model gradually decrease f rom the top of the model to the bottom of the model. With the increase of 
the peak input acceleration, the displacement response of the two station models shows a pattern of 
increasing with the increase of seismic excitation. In the EL -3 condition, the dis placement of S1 
measurement point of the arched station is 3.932 mm, and the relative displacement of S1 
measurement point of the rectangular station is 7.503 mm. In the EL -2 condition, the displacement 
of S3 measurement point of the arched station is 3.14 3 mm, and the first pair displacement of S3 
measurement point of the rectangular station is 5.695 mm. The peak relative displacements of the 
measurement points and the bottom measurement points are relatively small. Table 5 shows the peak

structure, it is assumed that the model soil layer is a single homogeneous soil layer, and the soil is 
taken as plastic loess, the density of structural model material is changed, and the finite element model 
of the underground structure and other parameters of material and burial depth is kept constant. The 
acceleration value of 0.1g of E1 Centro wave ground vibration is input at the bottom of the model, 
and the difference of relative displacement of the top and bottom plates of the station structure and 
the change of internal structur al force is considered.

displacement time curve of the top and bottom slab of the station structure. 0.3 times the concrete 
strength, the relative displacement is 1.5 mm for a sidewall height of 3 m. 0.6 times the concrete 
strength, the relative displacement is 1.4 mm for a sidewall height of 3 m. The relative displacement 
of the original concrete strength is 1.2 mm for a sidewall height of 3 m. The relative displacement of 
the station s tructure remains basically the same for different concrete strengths. The relative 
displacement of the station structure remains the same for different concrete strengths. The chang ing 
pattern of the time course curve of the top and bottom slab of the station with different concrete 
strengths is consistent, and the amplitude of the time course curve remains the same.  
Table 6 shows the values of internal forces in each section of the station structure. 2042.68 KN for 
the cross -sectional axial force of 0.3 times the concrete strength in section A1. 2053.84 KN for the 
cross -sectional axial force of 0.6 times the concrete strength in section A1. 989.78 KN*m for the 
cross -sectional bending moment of 0.3 times the concrete strength in section A1. 991.76 KN*m for 
the cross -sectional bending moment of 0.6 times the concrete strength in section A1. The effect of 
concrete strengt h on the internal force of the station structure under earthquake load is basically 
negligible. The variation of concrete strength has a limited effect on the magnitude of horizontal 
displacement and the time course curve of the top and bottom slab displacement of the underground 
structure of the subway station. The effect on the internal forces of the main observation surfaces of 
the station structure is basically negligible.

4.3 Effect of soil stiffness on the dynamic response of underground structures in subway 
stations  
To study the effect of dynamic shear modulus Gmax on the seismic response of subway underground 
structure, it is assumed that the model soil layer is a single homogeneous soil layer, other parameters 
of the soil are kept constant, the soil is taken as plas tic loess, the finite element model of the 
underground structure and material parameters and burial depth is kept constant. The shear modulus 
Gmax=80Mpa, Gmax=100MPa, Gmax=150MPa and Gmax=200MPa of the three soils are taken 
respectively, and the E1 -Centro ground shaking with acceleration value of 0.1g is input at the bottom 
of the model to consider the difference of structural displacement of the station under the above three 
cases.  
Figure 8 shows the time course of relative horizontal displacement of the station structure sidewall 
under the three cases of the maximum dynamic shear modulus of soil. Figure 9 shows the relative 
horizontal displacement curves of the top and bottom slabs of the station structure for three types of 

Optimal seismic solution design for underground frame structure of subway station considering uniform 
damage  15 
soil masses with maximum dynamic shear modulus. With the increase of the maximum dynamic shear 
modulus of soil, the peak value of the time course curve of the relative horizontal displacement of the 
top and bottom of the station decreases , and the maximum value of the relative horizontal 
displacement of the top and bottom of the sidewall also has the same pattern. In the weak site where 
the maximum dynamic shear modulus of the soil is small, the deformation of the underground 
structure is l arger compared to  that of the underground structure, which causes damage to the 
underground structure.

5 Conclusion  
In this paper, the finite element model of the subway station structure is established based on the 
dynamic finite element theory, and the material ontological model is studied to determine the 
calculation of the stress -strain relationship and the damage calculation method for various materials, 
and the influence of structural form on displacement and the influence of concrete strength and soil 
stiffness on the dynamic response of the underground structure of the s ubway station is studied. The 
following con clusions are drawn:  
Under EL -2 working condition s, the displacement of S3 measurement point of the arch station is 
3.143, and the first pair displacement of S3 measurement point of the rectangular station is 5.695. 
The relative displacement of different measurement points of its station model and the pea k of the 
bottom measurement point are relatively small under the same seismic action.  
The shear modulus of soil with Gmax=80Mpa has a relative displacement of 3.5 mm for a sidewall 
height of 3 m. The shear modulus of soil with Gmax=200Mpa has a relative displacement of 2.3 mm 
less than that of soil with Gmax=80Mpa for the same condition. Wi th the increase of the maximum 
dynamic shear modulus of soil, the peak of the relative horizontal displacement time curve of the top 
and bottom slab of the station decreases.  
The relative displacement of 0.6 times concrete strength is 0.1 mm less than that of 0.3 times concrete 
strength for a sidewall height of 3 m. The effect of concrete strength on the internal force, horizontal 
displacement, and internal force of the observa tion surface of the station structure under seismic 
loading is basically negligible.
