The rise of industrialized agriculture, coupled with a global demographic shift toward
urbanization, has marginalized every-day connections between individuals and soils.
This societal shift has led to a decline in the appreciation of and cultural identity
with soils. Amid a broader movement aimed at fostering soil awareness and environ-
mental action, many artists and designers have been instrumental in bringing soils
to the cultural mainstream, figuring their esthetic, social, political, and ecological
dimensions. Contemporary artists place great importance on the underlying idea of
animating soils through artistic practice, often transcending the physical artifact itself
to assign agency to soils and the myriad beings that occupy them. Artists harness a
multitude of media to articulate human-soil relationships. From the early environ-
mental art movements of the 1960s and 1970s to contemporary works centered on
urban and industrial brownfields, soils’ multifaceted roles in CO2transformation,
water and nutrient cycling, agriculture, and as living bodies buffering against pollu-
tion have become ground for public discourse. What could this mean for the vadose
zone in terms of reflecting on material flows in porous media beyond understandings
of soil physics? In this paper, we draw on over 20 years of experience in studying the
portrayal of soil in various arts genres to deliberate the potential of creative thinking
about and thinking with the vadose zone.
1 INTRODUCTION
Study of the vadose zone seeks to understand the material
dimensions of soils as they are expressed by the laws of
physics. Historically, these dimensions have been mathemat-
ically modeled using remote sensing and geospatial data to
enhance understanding of processes in the soil profile that
fluctuate between phases of saturation. We believe there are
other ways of observing, interpreting, and thinking with such
processes, that there are esthetic and philosophical dimen-
sions to material ebbs and flows, and that processes of wetting
and drying, leaching, and capillary rise encompass a poesy
and aesthesis as well as mathematical truth.

have left indelible marks by diverse cultures. The cultural
utilization of soil materials as a medium of craft and symbolic
and esthetic expression, be it as pigment (as explored by
Ugolini et al. [ 2010 ]) or as structural material, has a history
predating its use in agriculture. However, the advent of
industrialized agriculture and urbanization resulting from
violent settler-colonial expansion has all but obscured cul-
tural connections to soils and their material and ecological
properties. Most members of contemporary societies have
been cut off from regular interaction with soils, failing
to recognize flows within the soil unless they appear as
catastrophic mudslides or flooded streets. In this detachment
from ancestral, agricultural, spiritual, or material-structural

ties to the land, the esthetic and cultural significance of
soil has dwindled, leading to a sensory gap between many
humans and the Earth. Soil, as material body and habitat
teeming with life and meaning, is often reduced to “dirt.”
Klingan et al. ( 2014 , p. 25) lament that “the leakage of open
mining pits and hydraulic fracking of rocks,” among other
calamities, have turned the permeable, life-supporting safe
space of the critical zone into a “mud zone.”
Paradoxically, despite this waning appreciation, contem-
porary soil protection paradigms predominantly rely on soil
scientific evidence, sidelining cultural values and local knowl-
edge and conservation strategies that could reinvigorate
human perception of soils and foster better treatment of terres-
trial landscapes under the current pressures of climate change
and land degradation. Other publications have addressed this
disparity, advocating for stronger integration of soil science
into education at all levels (as proposed by Herrmann [ 2006 ]
and Smiles et al. [ 2000 ]) and the development of more
accessible public resources (as exemplified by van Baren
et al. [ 1998 ]). Other authors have argued that soils must be
considered based on their social, political, and cultural dimen-
sions (as championed by Greenland [ 1991 ]; Lyons [ 2020 ];
Meulemans et al. [ 2018 ]; Puig de Bellacasa [ 2015 ]; Salazar
et al. [ 2020 ]; and Winiwarter [ 2006, 2019 ]). Additionally,
these and other authors underscore the potential role of art as
a tool for environmental communication and consciousness-
raising (explored by Feller et al. [ 2010 ], Toland & Wessolek
[2010a ,2010b ]; Toland et al. [ 2018 ]; Ugolini et al. [ 2010 ]; and
van Breemen [ 2010 ]). It is this latter point that has formed the
core of our inquiries over the last 20 years. While soil scien-
tific research offers lawmakers and the public a foundation of
numerical analyses and expert projections, art plays a pivotal
role in conveying environmental issues to a broader audience,
acknowledging other forms of material and cultural knowl-
edge and local soil expertise. Art thrives as a realm of free
experimentation where ideas can be independently and criti-
cally tested before entering mainstream discourse, reflecting
on shifts in cultural understanding of soils as well as actively
reimagining “soil literacy” in public spaces.
The significance of art and design in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields such as infor-
mation technology, robotics, and materials science, but also
environmental engineering and earth sciences is evident at
renowned festivals such as Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria;
Transmediale in Berlin, Germany; Pixelache in Helsinki, Fin-
land; and RIXC Art Science Festival in Riga, Latvia, among
others. Wilson ( 2002a ) suggests that art and science encom-
pass intersecting cultural duties, working together to promote
environmental consciousness. It is thus a cultural necessity
for both scientists and artists working with soils to bridge
communication gaps, enhance public awareness, and develop
more inclusive approaches to soil conservation.
In the past, Bouma and Hartemink ( 2002 ) have under-
scored the necessity for interdisciplinary research programsCore Ideas
∙Soil scientists need to actively engaging with
artists, designers, and cultural practitioners to
bring soil topics to a wider audience.
∙We support fostering teaching collaboration across
disciplines and transdisciplinary exchange.
∙We aspire to reform the structure of research
funding.
to facilitate communication among soil scientists, planners,
policymakers, and other stakeholders. Yaalon ( 1996 ) similarly
emphasized the transfer of soil technology between industri-
alized and developing nations. Establishing robust research
partnerships is crucial for the effective exchange of knowl-
edge between scientific and artistic disciplines. Organizations
like the Leonardo International Society for the Arts, Sciences
and Technology, the Art and Science Collaborations Inc., and
the arts and ecology programs at educational institutions of
all levels attempt to bridge communication divides. In addi-
tion to the international festivals mentioned above, long-term
initiatives such as Cape Farewell and the 350.org campaign,
the Anthropocene Curriculum and Commons of the Max
Planck Institute and House of World Cultures, the alternative
public pedagogies of Floating Berlin, and the internationally
touring exhibition “an example to follow/ETF!” have suc-
cessfully brought together artists, scientists, and educators
over many years to raise awareness about climate change,
including the many challenges facing soils. Most significantly,
the 2015 UN International Year of Soils and 2015–2024
Decade of Soils provided a momentous opportunity for many
interdisciplinary institutions, public programs, and individual
protagonists to address soil conservation on a broader cultural
scale. Since 2015, soils can be found on most agendas at cul-
tural institutions of all sizes and levels of prominence, from
neighborhood-run galleries and community gardens to major
museums and festivals. Through interdisciplinary engage-
ment and a general sense of urgency, soils have (re-)entered
the mainstream.
This paper serves as one step in a process of reverse knowl-
edge transfer, introducing examples of soil art to a primarily
scientific audience. Conversely, we are intrigued by the cre-
ative facets of scientific research and how they can enrich
artistic practice. Our overarching goal is to encourage collab-
orative endeavors between scientists and artists, aiming not
only to enhance public understanding but also to pool method-
ological know-how in confronting issues of contamination,
erosion, and lobbying for legal protection. By amalgamat-
ing the insights gleaned from several contextual reviews and
opinion papers we have coauthored over the last 10–15 years,
our work as both commissioners and co-commissioners of the

German Soil Science Society’s Commission on Soils in Soci-
ety and Education (2011–2015) and Alexandra Toland’s work
as co-commissioner of IUSS Commission 4.5 History, Philos-
ophy, and Sociology of Soil Science (2022–2026), as well as
several innovative field experiments of our own and with stu-
dents, we reflect on different opportunities for collaboration
between and across disciplines dedicated to understanding
soils. Our ambition is thus to foster a deeper appreciation for
the interplay between the arts and sciences, a combination that
holds much potential in advancing appreciation for the vadose
zone and for soil protection practices more broadly.
1.1 Authors’ motivation
Gerd’s professional background is soil physics and hydrology,
complemented by studying fine art techniques and art his-
tory. Alexandra’s background is rooted in the visual arts and
environmental humanities, complimented by an engineering
degree in landscape planning. Their collaborative research is
uniquely shaped by the integration of art and design methods,
drawing inspiration from fine art painting, which inherently
explores the dynamics of flows and material transformations
and performative and conceptual art, which situates soil as
subjective and social entity. Their experiences and interests
are rooted in an urban ecological context, emphasizing not
only the dynamics of moisture, nutrients, and pollutants but
also delving into the realms of site-specific history and pol-
itics. They explore how these factors impact both human
and more-than-human populations. Specifically, both authors
look at how artists appropriate scientific ideas in their work
and how these in turn resurface in scientific debates on the
vadose zone. How can art contribute to the protection of
soils and the safeguarding of water resources in soils, not
merely by fostering public comprehension and elevating cul-
tural appreciation, but also by devising innovative approaches
to confronting complex challenges of climate change, water
retention in landscapes, and energy transformation? And how
can such approaches be integrated into teaching and research?
Drawing on insights from several renowned artworks as well
as our own artistic experimentations, we argue that art plays
an integral role in generating dialogue between soil science
and society at large, which could innovate new understandings
of the vadose zone.
2 SOIL IN CONTEMPORARY ART
Depictions of soil and geologic forms may be identified in
almost all major artistic genres. From landscape painting
spanning works of Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel the
Elder all the way to Grant Wood’s farmlands of the 20th
century, from Chinese shan shui ink paintings to JapaneseDorodango mud balls, from the Land Art movement of the
1960s and 1970s to contemporary media art experiments to
sonify and digitize soil environments, to more recent envi-
ronmental and ecological art, it is important to distinguish
between artworks that utilize a symbolic reference to “earth,”
and those that contextualize “soil” as a distinct geophysical
and biochemical body. In past writings, we have thus defined
soil art as “art consciously in or with soil or about soil conser-
vation issues, expressed via a wide range of artistic disciplines
resulting in a multisensory esthetic experience” (Toland &
Wessolek, 2010a ,2010b ). Multisensorial approaches to soil
art include, for example, artists working with soil scent, soil,
and terroir; cultural practices of eating clays (geophagy);
soil sounding and sonification; and multisensorial sculpture
(Toland & Wolter, 2023 ).
Two main approaches to soil art can be articulated as fol-
lows: artwork that is primarily concerned with the formal
esthetic and material properties of soils, for example, as they
are dealt with in ceramics, architectural practice and pig-
ment making, and artwork that is ecologically restorative and
recognizes the many roles and functions of soils in the envi-
ronment. Matilsky ( 1992 ) makes a similar distinction between
artists who have “proposed or created ecological artworks that
provide solutions to the problems facing natural and urban
ecosystems” and artists who hone their skills to attract atten-
tion or create awareness of environmental issues by “framing
the problems through a variety of media.” The early land
artists, for example, were mainly occupied with material
forms, importing a visual vocabulary from the minimalist and
post-modern movements into remote natural settings. Artists
such as Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria, Robert Morris, and
Robert Smithson, for example, provoked new ways of perceiv-
ing the environment by bulldozing monumental shapes into
the landscape and exhibiting heaps of soil and rocks that were
intended to be seen as sculptural works. Several contemporary
artists have emerged in recent years to highlight the material
qualities of soils. Notably, Lara Almarcegui’s installation at
the Vienna Secession in 2010, Delcy Morelos’ installation of
“Earthly Paradise” at the 59th La Biennale di Venezia in 2022,
and Daniel Lie’s “Unnamed Entities” at the New Museum,
New York, in 2022 use tons of soil and construction fill in
large-scale room installations that provoke viewers to rethink
the value and meaning of soil as living materials in constant
cultural circulation.
Around the same time as the Land Art movement, begin-
ning in the late 1960s and 1970s, a more reactionary group
of environmental artists, including Alan Sonfist, Newton and
Helen Mayer Harrison, Agnes Denes, and Joseph Beuys,
began focusing their artistic efforts on repairing and restoring
ecosystems and creating attention to environmental degra-
dation. In both of these conceptual approaches, soils are
imagined otherwise, providing new perspectives on soils in
the environment and our relations to it. Different artistic

motifs speculate the essence of specific soil functions that
can be related back to soil scientific understanding of soil
functions. For instance, concepts of fertility are dealt with
in the works of Charles Simonds, Ana Mendieta, Shai Zakai,
Roxanne Swentzell, Annie Sprinkle, and Beth Stephens. The
archival and heritage function of soils are prominent in the
projects of Betty Beier, Marianne Greve, Cannupa Hanska
Luger, Mandy Martin, and Ekkeland Götze. Despite “a pro-
fusion of terms” (Bower, 2009 ), including land art, earth
art, environmental art, and now soil art, the term eco-art
historically refers to art with and for nature as opposed to
art simply about or in nature (Aagerstoun, 2007 ). In areas
with weak mitigation policies, eco-art has come to fill a
planning void in degenerate landscapes. Land remediation
and mitigation is disguised as sculpture and performance
art. Some interdisciplinary projects are unique in that they
are either initiated by or include artists in solving local
and regional environmental problems. For example, the Acid
Mine Drainage & Art project (1994–2005) in Vintondale,
PA, is a tribute to the cultural and environmental heritage
of the mining region. Artist Stacy Levy designed a passive
water treatment system, or “Litmus Garden,” to help com-
municate soil processes of buffering and filtration. Initiated
by art professors Tim Collins, Reiko Goto, and Bob Bingham
formerly of the Carnegie Mellon Studio for Creative Inquiry,
the Nine Mile Run greenway restoration project in Pitts-
burg, PA, also addresses complex soil remediation processes.
On a smaller scale, artist Georg Dietzler has confronted
soil contamination issues by using myco-remediation (i.e.,
remediation facilitated by fungi) in his long-term installa-
tion projects. In works such as Self-Decomposing Laboratory
(1999) and Moveable Oyster Mushroom Patch (1996–1997),
Dietzler makes use of the edible oyster mushroom ( Pleurotus
ostreatus ) to break down organic pollutants such as polychlo-
rinated biphenyls. In a similar bioremediation project, the
“Revival Field” (1990–1993), artist Mel Chin planted a field
of heavy metal-absorbing “hypo-accumulators” at the Pig’s
Eye Landfill in Minnesota. In another project, “Paydirt,” Chin
launched a public awareness campaign about the high lead
content in New Orleans’ soils, a problem that has increased
long after the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina receded.
The following works in particular stand out as “vadose zone
artworks” in our opinion, because of the ways they esthet-
ically and symbolically deal with the physical materiality
of urban soils, as public urban intervention, as time-based
works, and as multisensory social experience. In the first
example, permeable pavements, bioswales, berms, and basins
serve as sculptural mediums to draw attention to urban soils
and water cycles in public space. In the early 1980s, Gary
Riveschl showcased the imperative need for opening pave-
ments to provide nature an opportunity to rejuvenate and to
allow rainwater more space for infiltration in his series of
groundbreaking (literally) “break out” installations and sculp-
FIGURE 1 Gary Rieveschl, Breakout, 1981.
tural interventions in cities (Figure 1). During this period,
political advocates from green parties began advocating for
the restoration of natural hydrological systems within cities.
Over the past two decades, designing rainwater infiltration
solutions for urban areas has evolved into a standard prac-
tice, aimed at closing the hydrologic cycle. In the last decade,
city planners have embraced the concept of “sponge cities”
to design increased rainwater retention that can better buffer
the extreme runoff of intense rainfall events. Cities are now
expected to retain as much rainwater as possible for the pur-
pose of cooling urban environments and allowing for better
tree transpiration and more green space. Riveschl’s work was
a pioneering call for more pockets of unpaved soils in cities,
suggesting that rainwater infiltration and soil hydrology is not
only a topic for urban planners and soil cartographers but for
everyone who lives in cities and is affected by climate change
and its effects on the hydrologic cycle.
The second example focuses on the time-based phenomena
of soils, bringing to life moisture flows within the vadose zone
through practices of listening. Fluxus artist Dick Higgins, as
cited in Dezeuze ( 2014 ), “Origins of the Fluxus Score,” once
suggested that “musical activity takes place in time, and . . .
anything that just breaks up time happening in it, absorbing
it, is musical.” Toland ( 2023 ) has argued that according to
this logic, the events that take place in a single pedon are
musical. The musical score of an individual soil biography
is written down in soil horizons, which detail recognizable
patterns of chemical and physical events in the distribution
of various materials. Works that sonify these events are
particularly interesting for studying the vadose zone in
that they open soil physics and hydrology to the fields of
acoustic ecology and media art. Notably, the Waterviz project
(https://hubbardbrook.org/waterviz/ ) at Hubbard Brook
merges hydrology, art, music, and data design to collect real-
time hydrologic data like precipitation, streamflow, soil water,
and groundwater from the Hubbard Brook Experimental

Forest in New Hampshire. Using digital sensors that transmit
high-frequency data wirelessly to an internet-connected
computer model, water cycle components are calculated
and used for visualization and sonification. The resulting
artistic visuals and soundscapes accurately represent current
hydrological processes. Conceived by Dr. Lindsey Rustad,
artist Xavier Cortada, musician and sound artist Marty
Quinn, and research assistant Torrin Hallett, Waterviz offers
a unique opportunity to intuitively experience the ongoing
water dynamics in a forested watershed, intertwining science,
art, and music for a transformative listening experience.
In a further example that uses real-time data to capture the
acoustic phenomenology of soils, the “Sounding Soil” project
stands out in both its scientific precision and esthetic quality.
From 2017 to 2020, Swiss artist Marcus Maeder led a 20-
member team as part of a research consortium between the
Zurich University of the Arts ZHdK (Institute for Computer
Music and Sound Technology), the Swiss Federal Institute
for Forest, Snow and Agriculture Research, the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich, the National Soil Monitoring
Office, and the Biovision Foundation for Ecological Develop-
ment to develop methods for acoustic analysis of biological
activity in topsoils. In 2017, Maeder and colleagues chose 20
test sites based on land use and humus types and set up piezo-
electric sensors that converted soil vibrations into electrical
signals, captured as sounds. Recordings were taken 30-cm
deep and 60-cm wide, representing the biologically active part
of the soil. Soil samples at the recording sites were taken
with a puncture cylinder and then analyzed in the lab using
the Berlese and Winkler method, soil fauna was extracted,
taxonomically identified, and counted (Maeder et al., 2019 ).
In October 2018, an immersive installation at the Paul Klee
Centre in Bern featured a converted shipping container with
a green roof and dimly lit listening room with light and
sound that represented the recording sites at different depths.
The soil sounds included clicks, taps, vibrations, hisses, and
mechanical scratching that were augmented with weather and
aboveground sounds to create holistic listening experience,
inviting visitors to reimagine soil as a soundscape. The inter-
disciplinarity of sounding soil and Waterviz further invites
soil scientists to work with time-based media artists in explor-
ing what Sterne ( 2012 ) describes the “acoustic environment as
a field of study, just as we can study the characteristics of a
given landscape.”
Finally, the American artist Asad Raza combines social
interaction, relational esthetics, scientific recommendations,
and technogenic soil substrates in his work. Often exploring
dialogical exchanges and rejecting disciplinary boundaries,
Raza conceives of his art as a metabolic, active experience.
The installation work, “ Absorption ,” in which a group of
so-called “cultivators” tend to a room full of “neosoil,” has
been shown at the 34th Kaldor Public Art Project in Sydney,
Australia, in 2019, at Gropius Bau in Berlin in 2020, at theRuhr Biennale in Essen, 2021, at the “Down to Earth exhi-
bition” in Dresden, Germany, in 2022, and at the “We are
Compost/Composting the We” exhibition at the Centre for
Contemporary Art in Glasgow, UK, in 2022, on the occa-
sion of the 22nd World Congress of Soil Science. Keynote
speaker Suzi Huff Theodoro and other soil scientists debated
the potentials and limitations of human-made soils in cities
and other disturbed areas. All iterations of the exhibitions,
including podium discussions and other dialogic events, were
organized and conceptually realized in cooperation with soil
scientists from local universities.
Figure 2shows an example of the “Down to Earth” exhibi-
tion at the Gropius Bau in Berlin, Germany. A locally unique
“neosoil” manufactured out of local materials such as food
waste from local cafeterias, coffee grinds, cocoa husks, hair
from salons, and construction sand and other fill was mixed
together and carefully installed within the gallery space, cared
for by the “cultivators” throughout the duration of the exhibi-
tion, who explained basic soil properties such as texture and
pH, raking it, and finally giving it away to visitors to use in
their own gardens. The project allowed visitors to experience
the soil as a living body that is constantly changing and react-
ing to its myriad inputs and interactions. More than anything,
as the title, Absorption , alludes, both the soil and its cultivators
act as a conduit for conversation and community. Not only is
water absorbed, but also sound, smell, memory, and attention.
A smaller scale but similarly thought-provoking work,
“Pieces of meadow” by Veronika Pfaffinger (Figure 3),
demonstrates the living and virtual dimensions of soils.
Pfaffinger’s work was exhibited at the Technische Uni-
versität Dresden (TUD) Down to Earth exhibition, initi-
ated by Prof. Karl-Heinz Feger, the former President of
the German Soil Science Society, in cooperation with
Gwendolin Kremer, curatorial director of the “Kustodie”
of the TUD. ( https://tu-dresden.de/tu-dresden/nachhaltigkeit/

3 VADOSE ZONE ART
While the uppermost layer of topsoil is a rich place teeming
with life, its lowermost edge hangs over a wet roof of interwo-
ven capillaries that suck up the ground water into pore spaces
like millions of tiny cocktail straws dipped into the life-spring
below. The capillary rise of water against the force of grav-
ity in the intricate capillary fringe is determined by the size
and distribution of the pore spaces. These are determined by
the size and aggregation of soil particles, which in turn are
determined by the age and origin of parent materials present in
the subsoil. A gravelly glacial sand, for example, makes for a
coarser fringe than an aeolic loess, sticky clay, or muddy peat.
As a rule of thumb, the smaller the pore diameter, the higher
the capillary rise. Depending on the girth of the vadose zone,

from just a few centimeters to many meters thick, depend-
ing on the topography of the landscape and the depth of the
groundwater, the capillary fringe can fluctuate daily, such as
in soils of floodplains. It can also hold distant memories of
time-based moisture, such as for soils on semiarid plains. In
many ways, we can understand the vadose zone as a kind of
moisture storage bank for all life on earth—a place where
precious water is deposited, stored, drained, and refilled as
it slowly travels to the groundwater aquifer.
Interest in vadose zone topics began for the author Gerd
Wessolek already as a PhD student. While his scientificresearch focused on soil hydraulic and thermal properties,
hydro-pedo-transfer functions, and water and solute transport,
he felt it was important to explore these topics in free-style
visualizations that captured the essence of the flows and leaks
in the vadose zone. In 1995, he ventured into vadose zone
research through watercolor painting, itself another mate-
rial practice of the study of flows, stickiness, and leakages.
This endeavor coincided with a surge in water consump-
tion in Germany, leading to the construction of new wells
in the northern regions of Hannover to meet the growing
demand. The wells were often installed in landscapes with
gleyic soils used as grassland or meadow because of the shal-
low groundwater table. As a reaction of water pumping, the
water table dropped, and capillary rise became zero. The for-
mer grassland sites became much drier and, consequently,
were ploughed and transformed to arable land. This transfor-
mation process resulted in an increasing groundwater recharge
and high nitrate mineralization losses of the soil organic mat-
ter passing down to the groundwater. This scientific story is
summarized in Figure 4showing four typical land use situa-
tions for the same site. The arrows indicate the direction of
water and solute transport in a textbook style but with esthetic
elements. This picture is an example of soil science art (SSA)
used as cover page for a scientific report that was financed
by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The scientific
results were originally published in Renger et al. ( 1986 ) and
Strebel et al. ( 1989 ).
The next example shows two artworks reflecting on how
soil aggregation determines soil classification, proposing that
there is an esthetic dimension to soil physics (Figure 5).
The left image contains an original soil profile fixed in the
middle of the canvas, combined with fundamental equations
used in soil physics and hydrology. On the right side, soil

Both components of the image underscore the fundamental
necessity of mapping to translate the intricate nature of soil
into tangible soil physical and hydrological units. The artwork
on the right depicts two fundamental soil hydraulic func-
tions: water retention and hydraulic conductivity. However,
soil physics encounters difficulties in integrating soil structure
and aggregation criteria. Both artworks pay homage to Rien
van Genuchten, recognized for his contributions in modern-
izing soil physics as an environmental discipline. They also
stand as examples of a science-art methodology that could be
called SSA. The artworks convey that both soil mapping and
soil physics serve as formal instruments for comprehending
soil, yet they remain somewhat removed from the actuality
of the soil. Just as with all natural phenomena, neither sci-
ence nor art can fully elucidate it. Consequently, the lingering
question posed by the image is: How can we reconcile these
diverse perspectives?
Similarly, the coauthor’s (Alexandra Toland) interests in
the vadose zone also began as a PhD student at the Tech-
nical University Berlin (TUB). With formal training in the
humanities, visual arts, and landscape planning, she pursued
her doctoral research on soil and art in the DFG-funded grad-
uate research cluster for urban ecology. In 2015, she used
street dust collected from sealed areas in Berlin to create a
wall map of soil sealing in Wedding, Berlin, a district with
decreased green space and higher rates of air and soil pollu-
tion. Envisioning streets and sidewalks as an infrastructural
grind mill in which urban surfaces are subject to the same
forces of weathering as mountains and seashores, the author
placed soil-sealing maps on the soles of shoes and welcomed
visitors to the Art Laboratory Berlin to explore their own
neighborhoods and imagine less asphalt. The goal of the work
was to explore topics of soil sealing as they affect the environ-ment and human well-being: How does “imperviosity” affect
individuals and communities? How do humans overcome
concrete barriers to reconnect with soils?
Over the past two decades, the vadose zone has also fea-
tured prominently in university teaching at the TUB. In
courses and seminars such as “Urban Ecology” and “Soil
Functions,” artistic approaches were integrated alongside sci-
entific topics like soil sealing, water retention in cities, sponge
city design concepts, and the planning and evaluation of
ecosystem services provided by street trees. These endeavors
included (i) collaborations with artists, (ii) seminars focused
on the creation of soil-related movies, which can be accessed
on YouTube under the channel “MediaSoil” ( https://www.
youtube.com/@MediaSoil ), and (iii) providing opportunities
for students to engage in creative soil-art projects and field
exercises. One of the student-produced films featured a whim-
sical depiction of the urban water cycle, narrating the tale of
two raindrops, Willy and Wilma, as they descend onto the
urban terrain of Berlin. Along their hydrological journey, they
fall in love, lose track of each other, traverse distinct urban
paths, and ultimately reunite as they evaporate. The above-
mentioned creative field exercises were conducted, among
others, in an overgrown urban lot adjacent to the TUB campus.
Students specializing in landscape planning and environ-
mental engineering were encouraged to not only paint their
impressions but also to integrate artifacts discovered within
the soils into their artwork (Figure 6). At the conclusion of
the seminar, discussions extended beyond the artworks them-
selves, delving into the significance of urban discoveries in
relation to contamination risks and methods for decontam-
inating and repurposing the soil, considering its potential
uses on the site. This kind of teaching enables the devel-
opment of new criteria for seeing, teaching, mapping, and
evaluating soils and landscapes, effectively—and attractively
highlighting soil-related aspects.

the painting on the right illustrates a designated soil alphabet.

scientific and artistic narratives.
4 THE IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE
In 2018, Toland, Noller, and Wessolek published “Field to
Palette: Dialogues on Soil and Art in the Anthropocene,”
which is a dialogic investigation of the cultural meanings, rep-
resentations, and values of soil in a time of planetary change.
The book offers critical reflections on some of the most
challenging environmental problems of our time, including
land take, groundwater pollution, desertification, and biodi-
versity loss, as seen through the perspectives of different soil
practitioners. At the same time, the book celebrates diverse
forms of resilience in the face of such challenges, beginning

with its title as a way of honoring locally controlled food pro-
duction methods championed by “field to plate” movements
worldwide. By focusing on concepts of soil functionality,
the book weaves together different disciplinary perspectives
in a collection of dialogue texts between artists and scien-
tists, interviews by the editors and invited curators, essays
and poems by earth scientists and humanities scholars, soil
recipes, maps, and do-it-yourself experiments. With contri-
butions from over 100 internationally renowned researchers
and practitioners, “Field to Palette” presents a set of artistic
methodologies and worldviews that expand our understanding
of soil and encourage readers to develop their own interpre-
tations of the ground beneath our feet. More than anything,the book aims to facilitate dialogue about soil and encourage
exchange across and beyond disciplines.
Expanding on this dialogic work, we look back on two of
our own long-term transdisciplinary projects that have been
central to our understanding of the vadose zone. The first,
more recent project is the WindNODE research collaboration
from the years 2018–2021, funded by Federal Ministry of
Education and Research. The partnership was established
between (i) energy companies, (ii) soil scientists, and (iii)
artists and designers. The research project “WindNODE”
(https://www.windnode.de/en ) focused on the energy
transformation to renewable sources (wind parks) in Ger-
many and their little-known effects on soil resources. On a

FIGURE 7 Left: soil esthetic criteria; right: soil alphabetic topics, both painted by Wessolek in the context of a soil-art teaching exercise, 2007.
4000-km-long high-voltage energy terrace, a 360 kV cable
line was installed in the soil for transferring electric power
from the northern, windy part of Germany to the south with
a high energy demand. In a teaching collaboration in 2017,
Toland and Wessolek teamed up with Professor of Elemental
Design, Myriel Milicevic, from the FHP Potsdam, and
research assistant Dr. Björn Kluge for the interdisciplinary
“Electric Avenue” project. Environmental engineering and
landscape planning students and design students collected
data on energy uses, leaks, and potentials in energy diaries,
visited sites in Berlin and Brandenburg and worked together
to develop project ideas that addressed the soil-energy nexus.
Results of this “Energy meets Art” project were published by
Wessolek and Kluge ( 2020 ). Artist Betty Beier was part of
this interdisciplinary research project. Betty Beier has spent
over 20 years documenting soils found on contested sites of
major infrastructural projects around the world. Concerned
with the rising yearly loss of soil due to urban and industrial
development, Beier explores the loss of landscape in the
series “Erdschollen Archive” (Earth Print Archive). Within
this context, she prepared an “earth print” (1 m ×1m )o ft h e
soil surface to preserve a square meter of soil as it was before
the digging started (Figure 8,l e f t ) .
Because of implanting cable liner, soil properties and
functions are impacted as shown in Figure 9. Before the
intervention, soil formation development of soil structure
and nutrient translocation has been visible (Figure 9a). After
installing the cable liners, however, only a uniform topsoil
horizon and subsoil with cables remain (Figure 9b). Thus,
not only the historical profile of the soil changed but also its
functions from a pure agricultural land to an energy trans-
port media. The main soil function is now hosting the cables
safely and transferring cable-induced heat from the voltage
transport to the soil environment to prevent high cable tem-
peratures. Among others, a central question arose as to how to
predict soil thermal conductivity using theoretical and empir-ical approaches. A cable cross-section and some basic heat
transport equations are illustrated in Figure 9con a canvas
by Wessolek (2019), and scientifically discussed in an article
by Wessolek et al. ( 2023 ). Through our own artistic practice
and insightful discussions with Betty Beier, we try to reflect
on the science behind monitoring the environmental impacts
of large infrastructure projects that form the literal backbone
of the energy transition in Germany. As with Beier’s other
earth prints, artistic archival shows that no major infrastruc-
ture project can leave the soil intact. Scientific monitoring and
artistic recordkeeping bear witness to anthropogenic change.
The strength of the WindNODE project was that it placed
research on the vadose zone within larger public debates on
energy transition, energy security, and the politics of large
infrastructure projects. The question remains as to how this
work can influence public policy and legal frameworks. In
working on the “Field to Palette” (2018) volume, we similarly
invited authors to reflect on the sociopolitical concerns of soil
study, from addressing industrial agriculture to soil pollution
and waste management, to indigenous land use practices and
rights. Through this work, we aimed to make visible the his-
torical and political aspects that have influenced soil and art
activities.
The second vadose zone example picks up a human-made
environmental pollution topic, namely, the long-term leaching
of sulfate coming from huge rubble deposits of World War 2
(WW2) in Berlin, leading to problems in groundwater quality.
The research projects on this topic were financed by (i) the
DFG and (ii) the Berlin Government in cooperation with the
Berlin Water Works from 2010–2014.
About 30 years after ending the “cold war” in 1990, the
topic of war-effected soils came back while preparing this
article; two significant conflicts erupted that have direct and
long-lasting effects on not only world peace but the future
of soils: the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and
the 75-year conflict between Palestine and Israel. In the

words of former president of the International Union of Soil
Science, Lal ( 2022 , p. 43) has argued that “soil degrada-
tion and climate change are mutually reinforcing stressors,
which strongly interact and undermine peace.” While sustain-
able soil management and regenerative agriculture are vital
for world peace, social equity, and human and more-than-
human livelihood, military activities have extreme impacts
on the soil through compaction from heavy vehicles, intro-
duction of anthropogenic substrates from wartime debris and
rubble, and long-term pollution through the leakage of chem-
icals both associated with weaponry and the destruction of
infrastructure.The consequences of these conflicts for people, their per-
spectives on life, and the impact on soils and the environment
are vividly apparent in all areas affected by war. Scientists
and artists in the city of Berlin, Germany, have long been
grappling with the aftereffects of war on the environment.
For anyone interested in soils, these effects are exemplified
by massive rubble heaps such as the “Teufelsberg” (Devil’s
Mountain), an artificial hill constructed from building debris
from WW2, which has been the focus of several research
projects in the department of soil protection at the Techni-
cal University Berlin for over 20 years. About 30% of all
buildings in Berlin were destroyed during WW2. A portion

of the 26 million m3of rubble was deposited from 1950 to
1972 in a pyramidal shape according to plans by the renowned
architect Hans Scharoun, who also created the Berlin Phil-
harmonic. Additional components in the rubble include coal,
ash, slag, and gypsum from former brick and mortar build-
ings. Mineralogical, chemical, and numerical analyses lead to
the prognosis that sulfate leaching will continue for a duration
of over 3000 years. Thus, percolating water and ground-
water exhibit significantly elevated sulfate concentrations of
>750 mg L−1, leading to long-term challenges in pumping
and purifying groundwater to meet drinking water quality
standards. What a stark contrast: Hitler aimed to establish
a 1000-year Reich called Germania, which, however, lasted
only 12 years and sank into ruins, but the environmental
problems his regime created will persist for the next 3000
years, that is, 100 generations. Devastation to landscapes and
built infrastructure in Ukraine, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan,
Iraq, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Dafur
will similarly lead to the slow violence of groundwater
contamination and soil degradation for generations to come.
Currently, the reforested “Teufelsberg” is used as a recre-
ational area for sports, and the former Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) budlings, which were erected during the “cold
war,” are now used unofficially as a place for street art and
temporary cultural interventions, as illustrated by Figure 10.
The history of the Teufelsberg and its underground legacy
have been recognized by artists, who have addressed the
profound human suffering and the loss of homes. For exam-
ple, Philip Topolovac’s project “Soil Samples” (Bodenproben,
2005–2010) is an archive of hundreds of twisted jewels ofemerald and amber-colored glass that were collected in rub-
ble soils in Berlin and serve as a material memory of loss.
Notably, Dr. Lukasz Kosela, a Polish artist, has tackled this
issue by portraying individuals who lost everything during
the war with portraits printed on bricks sourced from rubble
heaps.
Figure 11gives impressions of the devastation in Berlin in
1945 and a view of Devil’s Mountain, which includes the for-
mer secretive CIA station of the United States. In the figure,
a typical rubble soil profile is displayed along with Kosela’s
artwork from 2002. More information on Devil’s Mountain,
long-term sulfate leaching, and artistic approaches are given
by Abel et al. ( 2015 ), Wessolek et al. ( 2011 ), and 2014. The
problem of addressing soil memory and cultural heritage of
war-affected soils in the context of cultural ecosystem services
is dealt with in Wessolek and Toland ( 2017 ). In the interest
of soil health and human well-being, we agree with Rattan
Lal’s proposal for a “soil-peace” nexus and see the potential
of art–science collaborations in not only addressing past con-
flicts and healing cultural and environmental memory, but in
working together to cultivate and restore healthy soils for the
sake of a common future.
5 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Because cities boast a concentration of cultural and artistic
activity as well as acclaimed research and academic insti-
tutions, urban soils can be considered a productive starting
point for interdisciplinary collaboration. This is reflected in

the selection of artworks above, many of which were created
in urban and industrial areas. While the field of soil science
has traditionally focused on optimizing soil as a resource
to produce food, fuel, and fiber, city soils have historically
been evaluated on different terms, that is, as medium for
buildings and infrastructure and place of water retention. An
increase in urban ecological research has led to new forms of
perception and environmental protection objectives in cities.
For example, urban soils offer a unique perspective into his-
tory. An archive of war, peace, cultural, and environmental
change is preserved beneath our backyards and sidewalks.
Urban agriculture and on-site rainwater harvesting have also
become important topics for subsistence farmers in develop-
ing nations as well as slow food movements in industrialized
nations. Open soils are also an important habitat for myriad
animals, insects, plants, and microbial life in cities. The diver-
sity, dynamics, and vulnerability of urban soils demand a need
for awareness, acceptance, and education and thus provide
creative stimulus for artistic involvement.
While artists can play a crucial role in sparking inter-
est in soil protection, Stephen Wilson ( 2010 ) suggests that
“artists can help researchers become aware of previously
unrecognized perspectives and cognitive frameworks, while
establishing connections with audiences beyond the research
community.” The question that remains is whether scien-
tific collaborators genuinely embrace new perspectives and
alternative cognitive frameworks when collaborating with
artists. How do scientists incorporate creative insights into
their research, and can this integration be influenced by inter-
disciplinary or cross-disciplinary collaborations? Lastly, dosuch collaborations typically arise from individual person-
alities seeking specific skills or from institutional structures
and funding opportunities for interdisciplinary research? To
enhance collaboration between soil scientists and artists, it
is imperative to revamp our traditional research funding
programs and educational institutions. Otherwise, soil protec-
tion will become increasingly one-sided and challenging to
achieve as soil science sub-disciplines delve into highly spe-
cialized topics that are not easily comprehensible or relevant
to the public. It is true; scientists are not inherently trained
in the realm of communication, but they could be through a
more wholistic education that included units on soil esthetics,
history, politics, and culture. In the context of contemporary
integration of art and science, we must consistently explore
the parallels that emerge between an ever-converging critical
art world and a culturally literate scientific community. To
engage in constructive dialogue, both domains must remain
open and informed about each other’s methods of observ-
ing and understanding the world. Deliberate cross-referencing
and regular engagement are essential. This is not just an
observation but a call to action. Professional artists, cultural
theorists, historians, poets, and social scientists should be
more frequently invited to soil science conferences, laborato-
ries, and journals to contribute to engineering more actively,
agricultural, and ecological discourse. Conversely, soil sci-
entists have much to offer at environmental art symposiums,
exhibitions, and seminars. And both have a responsibility to
address policymakers and stakeholders, using their skilled
expertise to make appeals for groundbreaking soil protection
legislation.

WESSOLEK AND TOLAND 13 of 14 Vadose Zone Journal
In lieu of a conclusion, the authors would like to draw atten-
tion to the following points addressed to the soil science and
vadose zone community:
∙Need for interdisciplinary models : The vadose zone is
undeniably a complex and dynamic system that plays a
pivotal role in groundwater protection. To gain a deeper
understanding for effective management, it is imperative to
consider the development of interdisciplinary models that
integrate different insights and sources of knowledge. Col-
laborative research spanning these fields can provide a more
holistic comprehension of vadose zone behavior.
∙Need for transdisciplinary lectures : Let us develop new
transdisciplinary and innovative teaching concepts to
inspire students and members of the public for the topic of
soil and vadose zone.
∙Challenges in applying knowledge : Despite significant
strides in vadose zone science, there can be a disconnect
between scientific knowledge and practical implementa-
tion. Efforts should be made to bridge this gap by actively
engaging with stakeholders, policymakers, and local com-
munities. This ensures that research findings are effectively
applied to real-world scenarios. The author’s experiences in
teaching and engaging with the public show how interdis-
ciplinary cooperation can help bridging theory and practice
for a better understanding of real-world problems.
∙Breaking away from formulaic thinking : Conventional and
formulaic approaches to vadose zone management and
research should be challenged. Encourage innovative think-
ing and the development of novel models that can address
the unique challenges posed by human activities and
climate change in the Anthropocene.
∙Diverse data collection, analysis, and presentation : Incor-
porate diverse data sources and analysis and presentation
techniques. This may involve leveraging remote sensing,
geospatial data, sensor networks, and machine learning
algorithms to enhance our understanding of vadose zone
processes. The fields of information design, media arts, and
visual communications can help make vadose zone data
more esthetic and more accessible.
∙Improved communication and accessibility : Address limi-
tations in communicating research findings. Explore com-
munication strategies to make scientific knowledge more
accessible to the wider community through clear and
engaging communication, public outreach, and open-access
publications. This facilitates better community engagement
and informed decision-making.
∙Water supply and memory : Investigate the relationship
between water and memory within the vadose zone. How
does the vadose zone store and release water, and what
implications does this have for water, that is, groundwa-
ter quality and management in future? Develop models that
capture this intricate interplay.∙Humor and collaboration : Utilize humor and collaboration
to foster interdisciplinary discussions. Sometimes, humor
can break down barriers and encourage creative thinking.
Collaboration among scientists from different fields can
lead to fresh insights.
∙Financing research : We must reevaluate our research poli-
cies and programs. Instead of exclusively financing pure
soil science projects, such as vadose zone research, let us
actively cooperate with cultural agents, artists, designers,
and science communicators. This collaboration could fos-
ter innovation and represent a new form of research, helping
our community to bring soil-related topics and messages to
the people.
