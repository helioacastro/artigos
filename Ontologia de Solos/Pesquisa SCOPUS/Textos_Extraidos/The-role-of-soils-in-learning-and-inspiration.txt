This paper reviews the literature on soil and nature ’s contributions to people
(NCP) around learning and inspiration, physical and psychological experi-
ences, and supporting identities, revealing a range of relationships toimagining, understanding and experiencing soil. Often labelled elsewhere
as‘cultural ecosystem services ’, these NCP provide a range of benefits that
are mostly non-material, non-consumptive and intangible. The reviewfinds that NCP framings help to highlight how soils have contributed to
inspiring learning and creative works, like art; to mental and physical
health benefits, such as through recreation and gardening; and to culturalidentities and practices, including religious practices and efforts for social
justice. Overall, soils have played a large role in human creative endeavours,
are the root of significant relationships to the environment and can be con-ceptualized through key metaphors, ideas and theory as a bridge linking
culture and nature together. Yet despite the wide-ranging contributions of
soils to these NCP , the literature remains uneven and much more remainsto be understood, including how relational values of care and stewardship
with soils can be fostered and how attention to the co-produced ‘biosocial ’
nature of soil can help improve practices for soil health.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘The role of soils in delivering
Nature ’s Contributions to People ’.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has brought attention to the broad range of
potential benefits from nature under the category of nature ’s contributions to
people (NCP) [1]. NCP was suggested as an alternative framing to ‘ecosystem
services, ’in part to engage a wider range of scholarship from the social sciences
and humanities and a larger discussion of values around ecosystems, and 18broad categories of NCP have been proposed [2]. This paper for the special
issue on ‘The role of soils in delivering NCP ’reviews literature on three different
but related NCP categories: those of NCP 15 —Learning and Inspiration, NCP
16—Physical and Psychological Experiences, and NCP 17 —Supporting Identi-
ties. For each case, while the use of the term ‘NCP ’is not yet widespread in
literature discussing soils, there are in fact numerous examples of how humanshave imagined, understood and experienced soil that represent the types of
benefits the term NCP tries to capture. Soils have inspired art, literature and
film; contributed to mental and physical health benefits from a variety of rec-reational and livelihood activities; and shaped cultural identities and practices.
The three NCP reviewed here are unique. NCP have been broadly divided
into regulating, material and non-material categories; the non-material NCP arealso labelled elsewhere as ‘cultural ecosystem services ’[3]. These NCP share in
common an attention to the non-consumptive, intangible and immaterial
benefits that people receive from nature. Table 1 presents how these NCP cat-egories have been defined by IPBES, along with related examples from
the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). The

three reviewed NCP are often associated with the idea of
‘relational values ’, which recognizes that people often see
themselves in shared relations with nature, or that nature facili-
tates opportunities for extended social relationships withothers [6,7]. Such relational values can be contrasted with the
instrumental values often associated with ecosystem services
in which a one-way relationship from ecosystems to peoplecan be quantitatively assessed and (economically) valued [8].
The non-material NCP are also distinctive because they are
constituted by interactions in specific places (i.e. are highlycontextual), unlike other NCP such as regulating services,
whose processes and outcomes are more universal [9].
With these key points in mind, several questions guided
this review: (i) what existing research on cultural, psychologi-
cal and social interactions with soil fits within NCP
categorizations? (ii) How does the concept of NCP help ussee soil –human contributions and interactions in new or par-
ticularly useful ways? And (iii) what gaps in research and
future directions does an NCP framing reveal? For the firstquestion, because NCP has only been in use as a term since
around 2015, the direct literature on NCP and soils is just
now emerging [10]. However, there is a long history of inter-disciplinary work on human interactions with soil that fits
with the idea of ‘nature ’s contributions ’, ranging from huma-
nities scholarship on art and soil to social science on the roleof soil in shaping identities and the social and psychological
benefits from nature [11], all of which are explored in §§3 –5
below. More recent scholarship on relational values andhuman contributions to soil materiality (discussed in §6) also
fits well within NCP framings.
On the second question of the usefulness of the NCP
concept, unlike other authors who have used soil ‘ecosystem
services ’concepts to explore what benefits soil can provide to
humans [12,13], this review presents NCP as a way to providea different approach to soil/society relations. Several authors
have stressed that NCP do not exist a priori to be supplied by
nature but are co-produced by interactions of humans with eco-systems [14]. An NCP approach can thus emphasize how
reciprocal relations with nature can be both created by and
manifested in soil [15], a framing that has implications forreconfiguring soil management practices and policies. Yet
despite the wide-ranging contributions of soils to human
well-being, the literature is uneven, as noted throughout thepaper in answering the third question, and much more remains
to be understood about how values can shape and be shaped by
soil. The paper concludes with an examination of how NCP as aframing device can help expand the diversity of approaches to
human engagement with soil, including through attention to
soil ethics and care and to the soil as a biosocial entity.
2. Methods
Using keywords associated with each of the three NCP under
review (table 1), Google Scholar and Web of Science were searchedfor scholarship on soil, focusing on exemplars and most citedworks, particularly those explicitly dealing with soil, rather thanstudies that briefly mentioned soil amid a range of other NCP orecosystem services. Rather than a systemic review, specificexamples that illustrated a range of benefits and values havebeen highlighted, with an eye to incorporating literature fromvaried parts of the world and dealing with different types of eco-systems and soil properties. The focus remained on indicativeapproaches that particularly fit an NCP framing, not on beingexhaustive with regard to the extensive history of literature
on soils. The review also zeroed in directly on the soil itself, notindirect associations, such as the outcomes of poor soil manage-ment (e.g. famine) that might affect NCP , or NCP that deriveindirectly from things that grow in soil (e.g. from forests orfood). This review should therefore be seen as suggestive of thedirections and emphasis of the historical and current literatureon soil that coincide with ‘intangible ’NCP categories, requiring
a broad-brush approach rather than a systematic examination ofthis wide field.
3. Soils and NCP 15: learning and inspiration
NCP 15 concerns how elements of nature have set the condi-
tions for learning and other creative endeavours, including
art, technology and other ‘inspirational ’benefits.
(a) Learning and education
Learning about soil has a long history , given that it has been an
object of study since at least the ancient Greeks, who often com-
bined observations of physical properties with reflections on therelational value of soils to humans [16]. The formal discipline
of soil science emerged in the nineteenth century, centred on
such key figures as Russian Vasily Vasil ’evich Dokuchaev
and German Justus von Liebig, who worked in fields and
laboratories, respectively , to determine the composition and his-
tories of soil formation, and whose ‘technocratic ’approaches
came to dominate the field to the exclusion of more relational
approaches [16]. However, soil science as a discipline has in
the past two decades centred on new interests in planetarychange [17], reframing the field towards a conjoining of both
technical and more socially oriented research foci.
Learning about soil has also long existed outside of formal
science settings as well, such as through work in community
gardens, remediation sites, farms and events like the UN
World Soil Day, providing opportunities for co-production ofknowledge between experts and laypeople. For example,
the French Observatory of Living Soils has promoted joint
scientist –farmer work to map soil microbiology across a
network of farms [18], contributing to the idea that humans
help facilitate ‘living ’soil. Research on indigenous knowledge
systems has also shown that learning about soil can be a sourceof ethical guidance on how human beings should behave
within and towards nature in many cultures [19]. In particular,
ethnopedology as a field has focused on identifying and under-standing these soil knowledge systems unique to different
cultural groups and often reflecting relational values within
them [20].
(b) Inspiration in art, film and literature
Inspiration from soil can be seen in the ways in which artists
have used soil, both as a spark for creativity and as a
medium itself [21]. The first surviving pictorial art was madeusing soils and charcoals, then pigments like red and yellow
ochre made from iron oxides, while the clay was first used to
produce both functional and artistic pottery [22]. Soils havealso been subjects of art, with many modern artists like
Cézanne, Gauguin and Dubuffet drawing attention to the
diversity and beauty of earth [23]. The later Land Art prac-titioners of the 1960s (including Robert Smithson, Ana
Mendieta and Walter de Maria) emerged in an era of rising
environmental awareness and used monumental componentsroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 376: 202001843
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 06 September 2025 

of the natural environment (including soil) as a way of rejecting
formal art galleries [24].
The ways in which soil as an artistic medium often reflects
social or relational values can also be seen in contemporary
artists engaging with soil (figure 1). These include ClairePentecost, whose work shapes soils into ingots, representing
soil’s considerable value, while Yusuke Asai paints ‘earth
murals ’(figure 1 a) from local soils where he is exhibiting
to demonstrate the contextual rootedness of soil. Truong
Cong Tung has used soil to dye fabric and to fill galleries
with the smell, representing conflicts over the environmentalchange in Vietnam (figure 1 b), while Dineo Seshee Bopape,
a South African artist, represents gender and language
within her earth installations (figure 1 c). These and other artists
have been featured in a recent book on soil and art, with the lit-
erature in this field substantial and growing [25], and this soil-
attentive art has in turn raised awareness of threats to soilhealth [26].
Soil has also been an inspiration for literature, such as Frank
Herbert ’s sci-fi book Dune [27] and its sequels and film, which
were inspired by his working on a soil conservation and dune
stabilization project in the 1950s in Oregon [28]. Other soil-
related novels include John Steinbeck ’sThe Grapes of Wrath
[29], in which mismanagement of topsoil in Dust Bowl
Oklahoma drives mass migration that in turn shapes the
future history of California [30], while Emile Zola ’sThe Earth
[31] and Pearl Buck ’sThe Good Earth [32] take soil as either a
key metaphor for their protagonists or the situations in
which they find themselves. There has even been an entirepoetry school focused on soil and earth, the ‘geological
school ’associated with the Leningrad Mining Institute, again
demonstrating the potential links between inspiring both
science and art through soil [33].
(c) Inspiration through technology and design
Unlike in art, there has been comparatively less attention to soil
and ideas of ‘inspiration ’in other fields, such as technology or
design. Soil processes themselves are often imitated in human
actions, such as composting, and many popular agro-ecologi-
cal practices to improve soils, such as no-till or cover crops,are essentially a form of biomimicry [34]. Scientists have also
used inspiration from Anthrosols, soils created by humans
(such as the high carbon Amazonian dark earths known asterra preta and terra mulata ), to guide research and application
on new technologies such as biochar [35]. Other examples of
using soil to both inspire design and provide a physicalmedium include housing styles using rammed earth walls,
adobe, and compressed earth bricks, which often confer
adaptive benefits like cooling or passive solar generation [36].
4. Soils and NCP 16: physical and psychological
experiences
NCP 16 relates to obtaining physical and psychological
benefits from being in or around nature.

(a) Physical benefits
While the literature on physical benefits from nature is
extensive, the soil is usually only the ground from which
these benefits emerge, and there is little research specific tosoil itself. Research on green spaces has noted that physical
experiences of being in nature often result in more exercise
and mobility, reduced weight, reduced stress and bloodpressure, and improved diet [37]. The overall literature does
not, however, make much distinction regarding the inter-
actions with soils leading to such improved health outcomes.
While recreation has been one of the most important cul-
tural ecosystem services identified, there is less attention to
physical recreation and tourism specifically built around thesoil. Although spectators may not see the direct connection,
many sporting experiences rely heavily on well-managed
soils, affecting everything from ball rebound on clay tenniscourts and cricket pitches to drainage of football fields [38],
demonstrating that soil is often a taken-for-granted background
to many important and enjoyable human experiences. Beyond a
few designated ‘geoparks ’that have unique soil types, such as
bogs and peats in Scotland that are well-integrated into touristvisits and hikes [39], or the practice of ‘mudlarking ’, exploring
sedimented riverbanks or other places for traces of antiquities,
there is little formal recreation around the soil. In fact, the phys-ical benefits that people may receive from recreating as tourists
can result in soil compaction and damage, as is reported in
some heavily visited sites [40].
(b) Psychological experiences
The mental health benefits from experiencing nature, rangingfrom urban green spaces to practices known as ‘forest bathing ’,
have been widely recognized [41,42]. Without soil such
benefits would not be possible, but much of the literature is
not direct in terms of explaining soil ’s specific relevance, indi-
cating a potential gap in research. Ecopsychology as a field has
also drawn attention to the approach of treating individuals
with psychotherapy that encourages stronger ecological identi-ties [43]; again, however, there is little specific reference to the
soil in and of itself in this field.
Gardening is the outdoor practice that makes the most direct
reference to working with soils to derive psychological benefits;
for example, digging in soil may provide mental health benefits
by relieving stress, a phenomenon noted in both older andyounger populations. In one study of allotment gardeners in
Tokyo, those actively gardening had better self-reported
mental health than their non-gardening neighbours, in additionto higher levels of social interaction [44]. In a studyof school chil-
dren who participated in garden projects, parents reported less
stress and higher self-esteem [45], yet how working with the soilitself generated mental health benefits remains a gap. Addition-
ally , food can provide psychological comfort, and there are
cultural practices of direct soil consumption associated withgeophagy worldwide that are perceived by practitioners to
potentially provide some mental or health benefits [46,47].
5. NCP 17: supporting identities
NCP 17 focuses on the ways in which religious, spiritual,
symbolic and social identity and experiences can be derived
from nature, and thus is a very broad category covering
many potential interactions with soil.(a) Soil and identities
Soil has been metaphorically and linguistically linked to human
identity from the earliest times; for example, the name Adam
from the Biblical creation story derives from the Hebrew wordadama, meaning earth, while our species name of homo comes
from a related word for humus in Latin [48]. Other major
world philosophies have echoed these ideas of earth as givinglife to humans or as forming the basis for existence; for example,
the five elements of wuyung philosophy in the IC h i n g refer to
earth (tu ˘), which was associated with balance and harmony
[49]. There are numerous ways in which metaphors around
soil have formed the basis of cultural and national identities.
The phrase ‘native soil ’often describes basic characteristics of
a society; for example, the phrase xiangtu in Chinese combines
the words for countryside and earth to present a metaphor for
China ’s rural and agrarian roots [50]. The concept of ‘blood
and soil ’originating in nineteenth-century Germany has much
darker meanings, used to mythologize rural lives, racial purity
and connections to homeland, a metaphor later adopted by
other genocidal regimes [51]. Ethnic divisions and conflicts
among self-described ‘sons of the soil ’and those perceived as
outsiders have led to numerous atrocities in history [52].
The development of ethics surrounding soil is a far more
positive way in which human identity has been linked tocaring for the earth. For example, Aldo Leopold ’s land ethic
described a type of reciprocal relationship with soil, in
which care for the land is part of caring for people [53].Studies have shown that relations with soil can be important
in shaping many farmers ’identities; for example, farmers ’
sense of place can influence how they address stewardshipof their soils [54], while social cohesion can be shaped by jud-
gements about how other farmers manage soil [55]. Attention
to how values and identities shape relations to soil are par-ticularly useful because they can impact whether farmers
adopt soil conservation practices [56], help determine who
might use soil data or benefit from extension services [57]and can move the discussion beyond the simple economic
benefits of better soil management [58].
Gender is also another identity linked to and potentially
shaped by soil relations, embodied by metaphors like ‘Mother
Earth ’. Women can have unique soil knowledge, often resulting
from specific cultivation practic es, experiences resulting from
gendered divisions of labour, or beliefs more focused on
‘caring ’[59,60]. There is also some evidence that women ’ss o i l
use practices may be more sustainable than men ’s; in one
study, men ’s labour was associated with excess fertilizer use
and soil compaction in Hungary [61], while in another example,
rich anthropogenic African ‘dark earths ’were traced to women ’s
practices of mixing cooking residues (e.g. charcoals or palm oils)
with soil [62]. Given that gender affects soil management through
various channels, ranging from land tenure, choice of crops,
access to marketing and other realms, this argues for more atten-
tion to gender in soil science and farmer extension, particularly
because women tend to be underrepresented in soil educationprograms [63]. Further, when g ender-blind interventions to
improve soil properties have be en introduced, this can affect
women ’s land rights, access and use, leading to conflicts [64,65].
(b) Soil and religious practices
Soil has also been fundamental to many religious and cultural
worldviews. Humans have long worshipped deities represent-
ing soil fertility and productivity, from Gaia and Demeter inroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 376: 202001845
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 06 September 2025 

ancient Greece, the Celtic god Danu and Ma ¯ori beliefs regard-
ing Papa-tu ¯-a¯-nuku, the earth mother [66]. The Japanese and
Chinese words for ‘earth ’are derived from ideas of land spirits
that resided in soil, and the symbol for the word ‘earth ’is itself
represented as a horizon of soil ( 土) [67]. There are significant
religious buildings dedicated to soils and earth, including
temples devoted to Shintoism in Japan and the Altar of theEarth and Heavens in Beijing [66]. Christianity also has many
Biblical references to soil or dust as being the composite
material of which man is made. Other diverse religious andcultural practices and rituals worldwide have been shaped
by soil, from mound building by early inhabitants of North
America and continued rituals by their descendants [68] tothe many significant burial practices and rituals involving
soil [69]. Such religious practices have often focused on
themes of stewardship, care and reciprocity with nature [47].
(c) Soils and social justice
Soils have an important role to play in symbolic discussionsof social and environmental justice as well, as racismand disempowerment have left many communities facing
soil degradation. For example, the numerous benefits of com-
munity gardening noted previously have been temperedby the realization that many urban soils are contaminated,
often because of environmental injustices around siting of pol-
luting industries [70]. Injustices in soil science, such as thenational soil survey process in the early twentieth century
that excluded non-white farmers in the USA [71], have also
been documented. Concerns about the inequitable conse-quences of the commodification of agriculture, soils and
other resources have influenced the work of activists like Van-
dana Shiva, whose well-known tract Soil Not Oil [72] highlights
the pitfalls of industrialized agriculture, while the ways in
which soil has been used to further the development of capit-
alism and widening economic divides have been the subjectof another recent book [73]. The potential injustices of soil
carbon markets that could marginalize communities through
‘green grabs ’have also been a recent topic of concern [74].
Much of this attention to the social consequences of inequal
access to the benefits of soil emerges from the field of political
ecology, which traces the ways in which structural forces shapeenvironmental change [75], and the growth of the field is often
traced to Piers Blaikie ’s ground-breaking book on land degra-
dation [76]. Subsequent work has continued to show theways in which marginalized peoples are often blamed for
soil erosion, rather than the practices of the powerful [77,78].
6. Discussion: the values of NCP framings
The literature on the ‘social ’NCP and their non-material
benefits has revealed a wide variety of practices, ideas, ima-
ginaries and identities linked to the soil around the world.
The literature also reveals useful linkages to some of theNCP explored in the rest of this special issue; for example,
artists featuring soil have brought attention to biophysical
soil health and the need for restoration practices [79]. Yetdespite the prominence given in religions, philosophies and
art, intangible NCP linked to soil are often overlooked in
research. Unlike forests or wildlife, for which extensivestudies of non-material benefits have emerged [80,81], soil
all too often remains in the background, only the substrate
from which other benefits arise or as the material underfootin human activities, like recreation. Such gaps argue in
favour of extending NCP-focused studies to ensure that
cultural and intangible benefits, and the ways in which
values shape soil management, receive further attention.Two areas where an NCP framing can help draw attention
to soil –human interactions and expand research in useful
directions are outlined below, which reflect recent relevantscholarship on relational values, knowledge production and
soil materiality.
(a) Reframing soil relations through culture and care
Recent studies have proposed ways to draw more attention to
soil’s enormous role in planetary health, from serving as a
repository for carbon to harbouring rich biodiversity [57],
and one suggestion has been to reframe attention to the soil
through a security lens in particular [82]. Yet such studiesof‘soil security ’have neglected some of the NCP dimensions
reviewed here. Similarly, improving the monetary valuation
of soil ecosystem services, as some have proposed, is likelyto miss the values embedded in the intangible NCP that are
potentially of importance [83]. Instead, a reframing around
the holistic concept of NCP might assist in recognizing thatsoil has been fundamental to human spiritual and intellectual
flourishing. Improved understanding of the cultural elements
of soil interactions, including the concept of ‘care’, appear
useful in this regard, and can help make the case for attention
to the multiple benefits and plural values of soil.
Indigenous knowledge could be particularly helpful in
understanding these interactions, given that these systems
often see soil management as a way to engage in larger reci-
procal relations with nature [84]. Examples include practicesin West Africa around the incorporation of termites into
soil management, rather than their eradication, recognizing
their positive role as a ‘partner ’to the farmer in improving
soil fertility [85]. Indigenous knowledge systems could pro-
vide resources to improve management and understanding
elsewhere, ranging from soil erosion prevention to integratedagro-ecological management [86]; such intimate knowledge
and attention often allow for pinpointing interventions
needed for soil health, rather than reliance on science andtechnology alone [87].
Critical assessments of how knowledge around soils is
produced have shown that researchers also play a large rolein stabilizing the concept of what ‘soil’is and what it does
for humans [88], and the different ways scientists and farmers
both engage and relate to soil often shape divergent out-comes in terms of priorities for management [89]. In other
words, how we understand soil shapes how we design
policies for it; this argues for additional explorations of theways in which different types of soil knowledge can lead to
practices that can help tackle the soil degradation crisis [90].
For example, identification of the multiple ways differentcommunities think of soil can help shift attention away
from a focus on yield and production alone in favour of atten-
tion to ethics and care [91,92], and the linkages between soiland human experiences and selves outlined in NCP 17 high-
light how identities can shape these values [15,54,58]. Given
the many threats to soil discussed elsewhere in this specialissue, understanding the ways in which soil-conserving
values can be fostered is a useful contribution of an NCP
framing [93,94].royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 376: 202001846

(b) Soil as a co-constructed and biosocial entity
Across all three examined NCP , one common theme was
the ways in which soil can be seen as an encapsulation
of nature and culture together, or as a co-constructed and‘biosocial entity ’. Such approaches are in contrast with
many current conceptualizations to soil; for example, the
European Commission recognizes social benefits from soilincluding as a ‘physical and cultural environment for
humans and human activities ’and an ‘archive of geological
and archaeological heritage ’, but these definitions reflect a
one-way relationship of soils servicing human needs, rather
than acknowledging the co-construction of soil from human
actions and relationships [95].
One framing of a more biosocial relationship with soil is
through the lens of ‘relational materiality ’[96]. Rather than
simply rendering services to people, soil in this way of think-ing is considered active matter that is shaping and being
shaped by society [15]. Relational materiality stresses the
agency of soils and the symmetry of relations: soils are both
generated by human attention and in return generate their
own reactions (i.e. politics, identities or ideas) [97]. Asnoted previously, concepts of relationality with soil are
often deeply embedded in many indigenous ontologies, as
well as material practices of soil creation or amendment[98]. Some authors have proposed that the current era of
the Anthropocene calls for a new recognition of the anthro
in soil studies (e.g. an anthropedology), which could focusnot only on human impact on soils, but how new soils like
‘Anthrosols ’and ‘Technisols ’are being created through the
impacts of a warming climate or the emergence of new micro-organisms [99].
Thinking of soil as a biosocial entity could also lead to new
conversations about how to treat soils as other than inertmatter. As one example, helping farmers ‘see’differently
through heuristic and aesthetic strategies that emphasize the
multispecies worlds embedded in soil could improve agricul-tural practices for both better soil and farmer health [94]. In
another trend, recent conversations around the rights of
nature have been extended to the idea of that there should be‘rights of soil ’, whereby threats to soil health and functionality
should be approached not just from technical or financial inter-
ventions, but legal and cultural ones. Eminent soil scientist
Rattan Lal has recently proposed that ‘soil degradation, pol-
lution, and depletion is a moral and ethical wrong that must
be stopped ’in recognition of the living components of soil
and the right of those components to flourish [100].
7. Conclusion
Through this review, it is clear that soils provide a wide-spread range of non-material benefits; indeed, it is hard to
see any aspect of human civilization that does not have
some link to soils, whether in the ways we grow food, thescope of our imaginations, or the aesthetics of our creative
worlds. At the same time, these cultural and relational
values have clear ties to understanding and improvingmaterial properties of soil: identities of farmers may influence
their farming practices, thereby expanding or shrinking soil
carbon stocks, while art and aesthetics around soil canbuild support for restoration efforts that would improve
soil health and supply of other NCP like water quality. Over-
all, the conceptual framing of ‘nature ’s contributions ’affords
a broad examination of these issues and highlights the variety
of ways that humans value and understand soil. Approach-
ing soils from an NCP lens helps illuminate the fact thatsoils have played a large role in human creative endeavours,
are the root of significant relationships to the environment,
and can be conceptualized as a bridge linking culture andnature together. Continuing efforts are needed to expand
on these foundations and push further attention to learning,
inspiration, physical and psychological benefits, and socialidentities in relation to soil, particularly around the
promising concepts of soil care and biosocial relations.
