Issues of water security overlap with structural inequalities
based on power ( Myrttinen et al., 2018 , p. 3). Lived experiences
of access, use, control, and management of water are determined
by existing gendered structures and extend to other aspects of
identity such as class, race, indigeneity, religion, political and
civil agency ( Leder et al., 2017 ;Truelove, 2019 ;Sultana, 2020 ).
Thus,throughanintersectionalitylens,agenderedcontext-speciﬁc
analysiscombineswithothermultipleaxesofshiftingsocialpower
(Fletcher, 2018 ), with implications for how we understand, and
tackle,water(in)securityinarangeofdiversecontexts.
It is with this understanding that we came together on an
international, interdisciplinary project designed to better address
water (in)security. Funded in 2018, the Water Security and
Sustainable Development Hub is a ﬁve-year project committed to
“Adopting a systems approach to dealing with water security at
a global scale”, supported via the UK Research and Innovation’s
(UKRI)GlobalChallengesResearchFund(GCRF)./three.tnumExplicitinthis
understanding is the need for inter/transdisciplinarity, bringing
science and social science into dialogue to solve global challenges
around water. That social sciences must be “placed on an equal
footingwiththenaturalsciencesandengineering”( Martin-Ortega,
2023, p. 2) may increasingly be accepted as the theoretical
norm, but what this looks like in practice in the context of
international partnerships is less clear. The Hub brings engineers,
risk modelers, and climate scientists into dialogue with social
scientists specializing in the governance, politics, and ethics of
wateracrossColombia,Ethiopia,India,Malaysia,andtheUK.Our
challenge, as a Hub, is to bring this dialogue to life and reﬂect
honestly on the opportunities and challenges it presents for how
weunderstand,andtackle,water(in)security.
In this conceptual analysis piece, we set out some of the
negotiations and tensions that emerge when we try to build a

all our colleagues in how we understand the function of power
and inequality in relation to the distribution of water resources
and the ways in which intersectional inequalities shape access
to, and availability of, water. We conclude that our international

Collaboration and partnerships in the
Hub
TheHubwasinitiallystructuredaroundsixworkstreams(WS):
WS1—“Collaboratories” (Collaborative Laboratories), vehicles for
place-based research; WS2—“Enabling Tools” to support systems
integration; WS3 to WS5—challenge-led research on “Risks”
(WS3), “Values” (WS4), and “Governance” (WS5); and WS6—
“Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning” (MEL). Our Inception
Workshop (February 2019) was held to reaﬃrm our international
partnerships, identify Inception Phase activities, and conﬁrm our
Theory of Change. Gender (as a theoretical concept and thematic
research area) was frequently mentioned—primarily in relation to
workstreams 4 and 5—and there was signiﬁcant commitment and
recognition of the need to move beyond (for example) simply
generating gender-disaggregated data and “tick box” exercises.
Funder feedback on our Inception Report (September 2019)
requiredustoaddgender-disaggregateddatatoourlogframe.
Our ﬁrst Hub Assembly (September 2019) sought to refresh
partnerships and facilitate new connections [particularly among
our Early Career Researchers (ECRs)], to ﬁnalize 12-month
workstream plans, and outline plans to the mid-term of the
project. During this Assembly, there was broad (albeit not total)
understanding that central to achieving the aims of the Hub was
theeﬀectivepositioningofgenderresearchacrosstheworkstreams.
At a very minimum, this took the form of incorporating
gender-related challenges in relation to workstream priorities, a
systematization of our approach across the Hub, and the stated
aim of delivering outputs related to gender and the wider theme
ofintersectionalityandwater(in)security.
Our secondHubAssembly(February2020) aimedto continue
driving forward our partnerships, ﬁnalize our workstream plans
to the mid-term of the project, and introduce our cross-cutting
themes.ItwasatthisAssemblythatgenderwasaﬃrmedascentral

outcomes. This was reframed as work on Power, Rights and
Intersectionality (PRInt) in issues of water (in)security, which

PRInt was launched at a workshop held following the Assembly
with the explicit recognition that gender is one of a number
of characteristics that intersect to create inequalities in access
to clean water and sanitation. Keen to encourage proactive and

voluntary engagement, attendance at the workshop was self-
selected. Inevitably, there was a strong social science contingent,
two organizations lacked representation, and one institution was
only represented by women researchers. The gender split of
attendees at this “gender day” was roughly 50:50, suggesting that
itisnotonlywomenwithaninterestintheseissues.Nonetheless,a
self-selecting separate day to discuss gender, power and inequality
has a silo-ing eﬀect that makes it harder to ensure that gender and
intersectionalityaretakenupasHub-wideprioritiesthatinﬂuence

Atthispoint,wherethisintersectionalresearchcouldnaturally
have been driven forward (following the recruitment of several

hit, delaying its implementation (as well as that of other emerging
cross-cutting themes). As a more enhanced research theme
than initially conceived, the intersectionality work also required
additional resourcing, which was jeopardized by the extensive
OverseasDevelopmentAssistance(ODA)cutsbytheUK’sForeign,
Commonwealth & Development Oﬃce (FCDO) in March 2021.
The cuts saw the Hub lose approximately 30% of our total budget
and the loss of our ﬂexible funds, as well as signiﬁcant loss of staﬀ
time which would have been used to support the development of
thisresearch.
With shifting priorities and resources, the Hub had to
pivot to focus on areas where intersectionality was already
incorporated. Our partners in Colombia were fundamental in
pushingtheHubtoworkthroughthesenewstructuralconstraints,
establishing collaborations with the University of Oxford (to
incorporate feminist ethics in the Hub’s approach to socio-
ecologicaljustice)andtheWaterandLandResourceCenter,Addis
AbabaUniversity(toembedsocio-ecologicaljusticemethodologies
inassessingclimate-andhealth-relatedwaterrisks).Throughthese
partnerships, we have identiﬁed gaps, audited our research, and
developed the dual lenses of a feminist ethics of care coupled with
socio-ecologicaljustice.
A feminist ethics of care and
socio-ecological justice: theorizing
our approach to water security
In order to shed light on the nature of the theoretical and
practicaldialogueswithinourglobalpartnership,hereweestablish
how we understand feminist ethics of care and how this can be
complimented by the nuanced concept of socio-ecological justice,
reﬂecting on what they might oﬀer to our attempts to understand
andaddressthemultidimensionalnatureofwater(in)security.We
thenpresenthowanintersectionallenstowardtheseconceptsisan
appropriateapproachtocapturetheircomplexities.
So,whatisafeministethicsofcareandwhymightitaﬀecthow
we approach questions of water (in)security? First, let us consider
“care”. Using Tronto’s(2013, p. 19) expansive deﬁnition of care,
“care” refers to all the ways we (that is, humanity as a collective)
“maintain, continue, and repair our “world” so that we can live
in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies and our
environments, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex
life-sustaining web”. Second, let us consider “feminist ethics”.Feminist ethics oﬀers a starting point by identifying the ways in
which existing gender inequalities and divisions of labor lead to
the presumption that women’s subordination is natural ( Jaggar,
1991).Recognizingthatindividualactionsoccurwithinthecontext
of broader social practices which are speciﬁc to time, space and
context, feminist ethics also seeks to emphasize practical recourses
forchange.Thisthencreatesethicalresponsibilities;feministethics
place strong emphasis on the possibilities for political change in
addition to theory with a focus beyond the political realm ( Jaggar,
1991).Feministethicsalsoaimstoaccountfortheexperiencesofall
people; it does not suppose that the experiences of one group, or a
fewgroups,willrepresenteveryone.Nordoesitpresumethatthese
experiences exist in a vacuum; instead, a feminist ethics approach
reveals hidden unequal power dynamics in our social and political
relations,challengingthetendencytonaturalizethegenderdivision
oflabor.
One potential implication of bringing together “care” with a
feminist ethics lens is that collectively we as researchers working
across diverse contexts have ethical responsibilities not just to
ourselvesbutalsotoeachotherwithinandbeyondourpartnership.
So how do we then conceptualize these ethical responsibilities?
Ethics frame our theories within political economic thought and
development. They play a role in society’s institutions. They frame
how development, and the research, projects and interventions
that underpin “development” eﬀorts, are evaluated. Mainstream
approaches to ethics draw overwhelmingly from Western ethical
and moral philosophy, thus establishing a normative framing
for what is valued in our research. Western ethics, as well as
social justice frameworks, predominantly sit within a liberal-
contractualist language of rights in which individuals are seen
as autonomous and separate from the other ( Jaggar, 1983 ). It
provides the dominant framing within international relations. For
example, the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (United Nations, 1948 ) focuses on the individual’s rights to
lifeandliberty,andtherighttofreedomofopinionandexpression.
Many countries have adopted these foundational values in their
constitutions. In the countries in our Hub partnership, we can
see these frames adopted in, for example, Article 21 in the Indian
Constitution and in parts of chapters 2 and 3 of the Ethiopian
Constitution. It is hard to determine the extent to which these
are performative rather than substantive inclusions, insofar as
implementation is patchy. In the case of water, despite the UN
declaringthataccesstowaterandsanitationisabasichumanright
in 2010,/four.tnumwork undertaken by Mehta et al. (2012) amongst others
highlightsforcefullythelimitstoupholdingtheserightsinpractice.
Feminist ethics of care scholars, in contrast, seek to shift
the focus from individual rights and interests to collective
acknowledgment and responsibility ( Hutchings, 2000 ). Many
feminist ethics scholars advocate for an expansive understanding
of care ( Tronto, 1993 ;Sevenhuijsen, 1998 ;Robinson, 1999 ;
Hankivsky, 2004 ;Held, 2004 ). A broad understanding of care
is grounded in the belief that all people are relational and
interdependent, and that care is essential in our daily lives; neither

persons nor societies could exist without care ( Held, 1999 ,2004).
As a form of labor, care encompasses the eﬀort applied to satisfy
basics needs and may incorporate the emotional concern for the
wellbeingofanotherwhichmotivatestheeﬀort( Himmelweit,1999 ;
Bowlby,2012 ).Wewouldnoteherewithcautionthatthisemphasis
on emotional concern may also be linked to the ways in which
care in market societies is feminized, and in turn low or unpaid
(seeHester, 2018 ). “Water work is hard”, Caruso et al. (2023, p.
1) remind us, and too often “[w]ater work is unpaid” and thus
under-valued,wherethe
costs of water provision are paid in inadequate water quantity
and quality, time spent walking or waiting, calories expended,
sleeplost,injuriessustained,andsafetyrisksendured.Fors ome,
the work is all consuming, and limits education and paid work
opportunities. For others, water work results in missing social
and community commitments, anxiety and stress, conﬂict, and
shameifhouseholdwaterneedsremainunmet.
Whilst we must guard against an overly romanticized notion
of care—given that care work is highly unevenly distributed due
to its unequal gender and class dimensions ( Ferrant et al., 2014 )—
we may nonetheless take inspiration from a feminist ethics of care
thatmovesawayfromnotionsofliberalatomisationtowardplacing
an importance on a connection between people, cooperation,
and community wellbeing ( Robinson, 1999 ;Held, 2004 ), whilst
simultaneouslyacknowledgingthehighlyunequaldivisionoflabor
that supports the collection, distribution and use of water toward
suchends.
This approach reveals the socio-cultural norms, sanctions,
values, and principles that govern social relations beyond a focus
on interrelations between people and it is here where the further
addition of a socio-ecological justice lens can help to address
the resultant challenges. While the scope of feminist ethics of
care includes the environment around us, the concept of socio-
ecological justice allows the interconnection with the ecological
world to be explicit ( Yaka, 2019 ). The concept of reciprocity in
feministethicsofcareemphasizescarebetweenpeople;thiscanbe
complementedwithasocio-ecologicaljusticelens,whichexplicitly
recognizes that reciprocity must be expanded between the human
andnon-humanworld.
Socio-ecological justice understands that the self is not
isolated from the environment but rather expands into a nature-
culture continuum. In other words, nature is part of the social
world (Gudynas, 2011 ), forming an intrinsic relationship between
ecological social spheres ( Yaka, 2019 , p. 363). Furthermore, when
thinking about ethics, questions about justice are unavoidable
(Yaka,2019 ).Thus,itisnecessarytocreateanewethicalconscience,
to transfer the concept of justice beyond society, to recognize the
ontologicalvalueofnature( Peña,2020 ).
Foundational to the concept of socio-ecological justice is
the ontological contributions of the human-nature relationship
by indigenous groups ( Blanco-Moreno and Peña-Varón, 2023 ),
challenging hegemonic western notions of how humans interact
with, and relate to, nature ( Yaka, 2020 ). Socio-ecological justice
is based on a recognition of the relational ontology of human
life and the non-human world, which is directly inﬂuenced from
indigenous worldviews, expanding who and what is included in
our collective care endeavors, which has been the focus of someof our reﬂections to date./five.tnumWe argue that western ontologies and
indigenous ontologies are not mutually exclusive, but exist as
multiplicitieswithintheirownrelationalcontext,withimplications
forhowweunderstandcareandwhodoes“waterwork”(see Caruso
etal.,2023 ).Thesemultiplicitiesalsoneedtobeconsideredinhow
weapproachinternationalpartnershipstotackleglobalchallenges,
and inﬂuence how we have worked as a Hub./six.tnumTherefore, this
extension to care through socio-ecological justice takes a critical
holisticandinterdisciplinaryperspective.
We can, moreover, bring a socio-ecological lens back into
dialoguewithnotionsof“care”.Workby Duﬀy(2011)distinguishes
between “nurturant” and “non-nurturant” care as a way to explore
how care embodies the physical environment. Nurturant care is
care of another person and directed at the relationship with the
other, while non-nurturant care is care of the physical world in a
way that provides a basis for nurturant caring ( Duﬀy, 2011 ). For
example, soil and water conservation on land used for food crops
would be considered a form of non-nurturant care. People care
for the land and water, which provides sustenance for people. For
some societies, this way of thinking of the physical environment
is embedded in their belief systems. As a canal employee in the
AndesinPeru’sMotuperegionexplains:“Whenariverﬂowsfrom
aboveintoapond,andwhenyoulistentothisfallingwater,itsays:
cuídame. If you take care of me, I will give you life. If you take
care of me, I will be here all your life. But if you do not take care
of me, I will stop ﬂowing. I will soon come to an end” (quote in
Domínguez-Guzmán et al., 2022 ). Similarly, social institutions—
shapedandreshapedbysociety—providetheframethroughwhich
nurturantcareoccurs.Evenwheresocialandpoliticalcontextsmay
berelativelyunstabledueto,forinstance,persistentarmedconﬂict
(anon-goingconcernformanycolleaguesinourHubpartnership),
what is clear is that eﬀorts to address water (in)security as a form
of care, including by local collective action, may become crucial to
supportinggreatersocialcohesion(see GarcíaVargas,2007 ).
Given that care is socially situated, many care ethics scholars
are uncomfortable prescribing a set of universal rules, an
approach which in turn brings real value to an interdisciplinary,
international research partnership. Thus, if we are to achieve
more nuanced and contextual approaches to water security, an
intersectional approach that incorporates both a socio-ecological
justice framing and a focus on feminist ethics of care in
how we conceptualize water (in)security needs to be more
integrated into the framing of the Hub’s work. Ideally, it means
embracing the diﬀerent ways of knowing and understanding
water issues and ways of addressing water (in)security, from
local actors and institutions to engineers and social scientists
from across the Hub countries, an experience we had in
Popayán, prior to our Hub Assembly in Cali, Colombia./seven.tnumIt
also means providing platforms to share ideas and work, and

being open to learning from one another, with the hope
it breaks down silos and creates new spaces for counter-
hegemonic transformations of human-nature relationships that in
turn support more dynamic and situated conceptualisations of
water(in)security.
Essential to a feminist ethics of care and socio-ecological
justiceisanexplicitrecognitionofthediversityoflivedexperience.
Here we can highlight the importance of intersectionality,
or the ways in which co-constituted identities shape people’s
subjective experiences (see Crenshaw, 1989 ).Collins et al.
(2021, p. 694) identify six core functional concepts: “namely,
relationality, power, social inequality, social context, complexity,
and social justice”. It is in the intersections, interactions, or
interplay of such social categorizations that the diﬀerential
power relations that link these social categories aﬀect
individuals and groups, either by reinforcing/supporting
or weakening prevailing power imbalances ( Olsvik, 2007 ).
Intersectionality addresses a critique of depoliticised and
formulaic gender mainstreaming in policy and practice ( Sultana,
2020).
The challenge in this area is to understand (in)equality as
conditioned by, and related to, other interlocking inequalities
through an intersectional approach that expressly considers
the dynamics of power in decision-making. It is possible
(and too easy) to create sets of checklists, policies, principles,
and indicators, but without realistic, contextual, and situated
plans for implementation these sets of things remain only
as nice words in documents, a tendency we are keen to
avoid. With an intersectional approach, we can observe
a synergy with a relational feminist ethics that seeks to
generate understanding of water (in)security that is situated
butalsosystemic.
How then do we understand what shapes intersectional
lived experiences with water? Here we would further argue
that it is necessary to deal with the complex, deeply embedded
relation between society and nature, where prevailing power
imbalances inﬂuence the experience of relative water (in)security.
Widening our understanding of ethical care also allows us
to embrace diverse, non-Western and indigenous intellectual
traditions in which relationality is foregrounded as a central
consideration for wellbeing (see, for example, Blackstock, 2011 ;
Boulton et al., 2015 ;Chan, 2017 ;Bedigen, 2022 ), wherein
water security, we argue, is integral. The mainstream water
literature focuses on water technology and issues of water
management and control. But recent studies in the critical water
literature highlight how the concept of care rooted in local
understandings of their relationship with the environment and
spiritual experiences plays an important role in arrangements for
managing water and maintaining irrigation systems and ground
water (e.g., Chitata et al., 2022 ;Domínguez-Guzmán et al., 2022 ),
and that there needs to be room for diverse, and at times,
divergent practices and ways of knowing in relation to water
(Zwarteveen et al., 2021 ). Moving beyond technocratic tick-
boxes and embracing this context-sensitive relationality is how
Crider and Ray (2022, p. 2) argue that we move “toward the
recognition of gender justice as a foundation for water justice
forall”.Contributions of feminist ethics of
care and socio-ecological justice to
international partnerships on water
(in)security
Bringing these lenses together, we suggest three principles
that encapsulate how we endeavor to approach our international

The ﬁrst principle is recognizing that all people, in all their
diversity, have the same fundamental human needs that require
care. Moreover, both the rights and interests of humans and the
broader environment within which we live must be considered
simultaneously. Such framing brings both the social and the
ecological within the realm of ethics, justice, and rights. It
acknowledges that people are dependent on both others and their
environment at any given time for their wellbeing, and it places
value on both “nurturant” and “non-nurturant” care labor. This
not only considers the impacts of water security programmes on
the environment, but also their impacts on care labor. This is
a principle that we also recognize must operate both within the
partnershipitselfaswellasthosewithwhomitengagesaspartners
orstakeholders.
For example, it is worth noting that face-to-face Hub
Assemblies,whilstbeneﬁcialinmanyways,candisproportionately
prevent participation of those with caring duties. When COVID-
19causedinternationaltraveltostop,ourHubAssembliesbecame
virtual events, which enabled more equal participation by carers
(irrespectiveofgendersandacrosscareerstages).
In addition to acknowledging identities which may place
individuals in their own unique category, the second principle
recognizes relationships between people and the environment and
that people are part of a larger interdependent socio-ecological
web. Here, the self is deﬁned through a web of human and non-
human relations, formed through encounters and engagement in
everytemporalandspatialcontext( Yaka,2019 ,2020).Inthisview,
humansarenotonlyconsumersofnature,butmustworkandbein
relation with nature as a signiﬁcant living world ( de la Bellacasa,
2015). For example, in the Andean region of the department
of Cauca, Colombia, the Kishu indigenous people have built a
reciprocal relationship with water. Through the ancestral process
of sowing water, the community has successfully recuperated
springs, streams, and lakes within their territory. Recognizing this
reciprocity with water has been key to how colleagues in the

By acknowledging that people’s lives are constructed through
their social, personal, and ecological relationships, there is an
explicitrecognitionthattheimpactsofwatersecurityprogrammes
on individuals, as well as the impacts of decisions in international
partnerships, are not siloed; rather, these impacts also have direct
and indirect eﬀects on human and non-human others. Linked
with the principle of interdependencies and shared future is an
explicit commitment to making a sustained impact on the lives of
the most vulnerable. This requires us to make a clear distinction

between “compassion” and “kindness”: “Compassion is a state of
knowledge about the suﬀering of others” ( Kumar, 2022 , p. 236).
The global challenge of water insecurity as entailed in SDG6 will
not beaddressed by compassion alone;it requires sustainedaction
supported by adequate funding at the global scale. Contrary to
compassionorgoodintentions,theideaofkindnessisaboutactions
aimedatassuaginghumansuﬀeringandvulnerabilities.According
toCole-KingandGilbert (2011,p.29),kindnessmeans“sensitivity
to the distress of ... others with a commitment to try and do
something about it”. If the global challenge of water security and
sustainabledevelopmentistobetranscended,wewouldarguethat
a relational kindness must be placed at the heart of a feminist
ethics of care framework. Here we also need to be mindful that
“care” and “compassion” do not simply reproduce and concretise
the gendered nature of “water work”, that, as we have seen, is
intrinsically feminized. The key here is that if compassion and
kindnessaretobeintegraltotheachievementofSDG6,thensuch
sentimentsmustbefollowedbyaction,andwithinthisactionmust
beattemptstoredresstheunequaldivisionoflabor—cuttingacross
race, class and gendered axes of diﬀerence—in how we manage
water(in)security.
Taking this even further, the third and ﬁnal principle is
collective responsibility in our partnership. Tronto(2013) argues
that shared eﬀort for care of the collective promotes a society in
which time is created to attend to work and care. This means
collectivelysharingcareforbothothersandourenvironment.This
does not imply that we need a singular, monolithic framework
based on these shared principles. Blanco-Moreno and Peña-
Varón(2023) note in their work in Colombia, for example,
that organizations operate with heterogenous concepts of justice
that support varied water ontologies, highlighting the value of
recognizingthesediﬀerentstrandsofwork,whichisagainanother
areainwhichCollaboratorieshavebeenactive./nine.tnum
Additionally, we need to emphasize the co-creation initiatives
that support researchers in their role as facilitators of collective
communication between marginalized populations and decision
makers, to assure that our research, and research impact, is
not siloed from the needs and priorities of marginalized groups
(ChoongandNeo,2022 ).
Embedding these theoretical frames in
thedesignanddeliveryofourresearch
programme
The challenge for our interdisciplinary, international
partnership has always been to convert these principles into
foundational drivers of our practice. In this section, we set out the
challenges to realizing research designs and outcomes that reﬂect
thesesharedvaluesandprinciples.Honestyabouttheselimitations
means acknowledging that we too are constrained in our practices
bythesamesystemsthatoperatetoindividualizeand/orinvisibilise
relational care labor; that we, in turn, potentially exacerbate the
very water insecurity we seek to ameliorate. Here we note two key
/nine.tnumhttps://www.watersecurityhub.org/news-events/news/wate r-security-
rural-communities ;https://youtu.be/w/seven.tnumnnN/zero.tnumoaM/four.tnumEconcerns. The ﬁrst is the tendency to see both water (in)security
and gender/intersectionality as technical rather than social and
political challenges. The second is that an expression of shared
values does not automatically convert into a shared understanding
of how to actualise theoretical commitments to intersectional
equality and ecological justice that are centered on care. We will
lookbrieﬂyateachoneinturn.
First, many initiatives that seek to address development
challenges or “tackle” the SDGs start with the search for
technological solutions or institutional/policy reform packages,
rather than engaging with the fuzzy complexity of global
challenges (see Ferguson, 1990 ). While at the start of our
collective deliberations in the Hub we wanted to embrace this
complexity in line with the systems approach we adopted to
solve problems of water insecurity, a divide was immediately
apparent between the engineers and the social scientists. The
former were keen to address water security as a complex but
ultimately technical challenge, while the social scientists were
committed to centring questions of power and inequality in water
governance and resource distribution. This divide has a well-
established history, insofar as the longer-term challenges of so-
called “development” are frequently interpreted as the “result of
a historical stage and a fundamentally technical problem (lack of
knowledge, education, infrastructure or technology) to be solved
bynonpoliticalinterventions”( Ziai,2016 ,p.151).
Despite being able to take advantage of the more forward-
thinking approach to GCRF bids that provided monies to bring
potential partners together as part of bid preparation, as well as a
six-month Inception Phase to establish governance, management,
and operational processes, a lack of time and space limited our
ability to generate shared meaning around how we collectively
understand complex social phenomena. Our Hub has been under
pressure to design and conduct research involving a core team
of 11 organizations working in partnership with a wider network
of 42 organizations across ﬁve countries. In the space of 5
years, we are required to design and deliver evidence-based
interventions,publishresearch,demonstrateimpact,andinﬂuence
water policy, notably in relation to meeting SDG6 targets across
all countries. The COVID-19 pandemic, followed by extensive
ODA cuts by the UK’s FCDO in March 2021 threatened the
existence of the Hub itself. Yet even without these extraordinary
circumstances, only 5 years to work toward water security in
5 countries in partnership with over 40 organizations poses
very real constraints to shared, international problem solving
deliveredthroughtheduallensesoffeministcareethicsandsocio-
ecologicaljustice.
Many of these constraints were the result of diﬀering
understandings of terminology, an unsurprising outcome
when working across multiple disciplines, languages, and
beliefsystems:
•A conversation on vulnerabilities 2.5 years into
the partnership looked to be reaching a frustrated
stalemate until the participants (both based in the UK)
realized that the engineer understood “vulnerability”
in the context of climate-related risks, while the
social scientist understood “vulnerability” in terms
ofinequalities.

•“Stakeholder” has an array of meanings within our
partnership, from a speciﬁc narrow focus on government
bodies (i.e. those with power/in charge), to a broad grouping
that encompasses government, industry, ands NGOs but
excludes communities (i.e. those with least power), to an
all-encompassing understanding that a stakeholder is anyone
with an interest or inﬂuence in the Hub. These diﬀerent
understandings speak to a broader discussion within the
academic community about the word “stakeholder” in the
contextofdecolonisingresearch./one.tnum/zero.tnum
•Aligned to the colonial undertones of the term “stakeholder”,
several colleagues outside of the UK understandably objected
to the problematic language of “change” and “beneﬁciaries”
in the context of research activities and impact due to
(1) the implication that the beneﬁciary was ignorant/doing
something wrong, and (2) the failure to recognize that we as
researcherscanlearnfromthenon-academicsweengagewith
and co-create solutions that draw upon their expertise and
livedexperience.
This problem around terminology was explicitly addressed
in the Learning element of our MEL framework via a series
of workshops with our Early Career Researchers (ECRs) on the
convergence of understanding of terms and key deﬁnitions across
the Hub./one.tnum/one.tnumPerhaps the “stickiest” term has been “gender”, given
that it is an indicator on which we are required by the funder to
report. As such, it is worth reﬂecting speciﬁcally on the challenges
work on gender has surfaced. All ODA-funded work has to “tick
a box” that gender equality considerations have been included in
any proposed work. Gender pertains to a set of socio-culturally
and politico-economically constructed social relations, roles, and
practices that change across time and space ( Fletcher, 2018 ). It
is context- and history-speciﬁc and is inseparable from power
relations and societal value systems ( Myrttinen et al., 2018 , p.
4). Yet mainstream research and funding infrastructures tend
to presume “gender” has a well-established, shared, or universal
meaning,whichisstrippedofsituatedandcontextualinsightsthat
may necessitate descriptors beyond, or instead of, the language of
“gender”. Indeed, “gender” itself is a highly contested term that
travels poorly outside the English language (see Samarasinghe,
2014;Narayanaswamy, 2017 ). Within the Hub, there exists a
multiplicity of understandings of the term. For some international
colleagues, gender is not perceived as a notable issue because
everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, even though inequity
is evident in social structures. For other colleagues, inequality is
embedded in legal frameworks, which has pushed women with
whom we are collaborating to take more active leadership roles
at the local level. We see, for instance, multiple and ﬂuid, gender-
diverseidentitiesthatdiﬀerfromthenormsofgenderbinaries(see
Lugones, 2007 ) may face more exclusion due to water insecurity
(seeRobinson et al., 2023 ). However, this nuance remains limited
in the Hub’s work. In our experience, including in writing this
/one.tnum/zero.tnumhttps://www.fasttrackimpact.com/post/alternatives-to-the- word-
stakeholder
/one.tnum/one.tnum This learning was captured in an internal document circula ted around
Hub colleagues, and the ﬁndings can be made available upon reques t.piece, interdisciplinary working is a challenge because of the need
to establish a common vocabulary and shared understanding of
these concepts that allows us to move beyond a reductionist
conceptualization of work on gender as merely a bureaucratic
exercise—as a simple counting exercise of binaries of men and
women within and beyond our project, or as work primarily
for the social scientists and/or women in our partnership that
is perceived as separate to the “main business” of pipes, water
pressure,andpotability.

actively seeks to move away from. Indeed, it can have the eﬀect
of seeing gender equality as a technical challenge (one of design,

transformingpowerrelations( Goetz,1994 ).Listsofindicatorsoﬀer

theyruntheinherentriskofexcessivesimpliﬁcationandofframing
fundamentally political questions as technical considerations (see
Merry,2016 ).
We recognize the danger of over-simpliﬁed narratives that
may result, for instance, in an extension of our commitment to
emphasizerelationalcare,tothencenterwomenas“natural”carers
for the earth (see Leach, 2007 ). We are committed to unsettling
the focus solely on the uneven burden borne by women and girls
in relation to water(in)security that entails a wider contextual or
structural analysis (see Doss et al., 2018 in relation to women
and myths around agriculture). Indeed, work in this space is
heavily contested and it is an area that is particularly prone to
simpliﬁcation at the international level through tools such as
“gender mainstreaming” and a reductive and generalized focus on
“womenandgirls”(see ChantandSweetman,2012 ;Hickel,2014 ).
The second concern regards what this commitment looks
like in practice. In the production of this piece itself, good faith
engagement revealed contestation as to the best way to approach
these issues in research design and implementation. All the co-
authors engage in a variety of data collection methods and
analysis, and one of the tools that surfaced for discussion was
sex-disaggregated data collection. How might we work together in
pursuit of socio-ecological justice through a feminist ethics of care
lens?Forsomecolleagues,sex-disaggregateddatacanbeapowerful
means of highlighting and monitoring gendered inequalities.
For example, sex disaggregating SDG6 indicators would allow
development actors to track and highlight gender inequalities
in the water and sanitation sector. But, only disaggregating by
sex, rather than a range of intersectional factors, can hide the
structural and institutional production of multiple and inter-
related inequalities (see Joshi, 2005 ). Sex-disaggregated indicators
can potentially obscure more complex social dynamics that in
turn have the adverse eﬀect of hiding within-group inequalities,
whichcanbeseenasdepoliticizing,neutralizing,andinvisibilizing

Osborne, 2015 ). Thus, they need to be used carefully. A combined

socio-ecological justice and feminist ethics of care approach goes
beyond simple sex-disaggregated indicators and aims to gather
information on peoples’ intersectional identities and associated
challenges; diﬀering care roles and needs; relationships to others
and their environment; and the interconnecting power dynamics,
with the aim to explore impacts of water security programmes
or water (in)security phenomena through the lens of the guiding
principleslaidoutabove.
Our preparation of this piece also revealed divergent views
aboutthevalueofwomen’sinclusionandleadershipinandaround
how to manage water and identiﬁed where there is no clear
empirical “answer” to the design conundrum. Some co-authors
have raised questions about whether leadership structures have
been integral to the more technocratic interpretations of water
security, whereas others would argue that women’s inclusion is no
guarantorofmoreinclusive,equitable,ordynamicresearchdesign
and implementation. Within the Hub, we have recognized since
our inception that gender is one of a number of characteristics
that intersect to create inequity within our research team. We
have sought to ensure gender balance of (for example) our
Ethics Committee and International Advisory Board—alongside
a balance of religions, ethnicities, organizations, geographies and
disciplines—and actively championed the advancement of our
femaleECRs.WemadeanexplicitcommitmenttoEDIT(equality,
diversity, inclusion, transparency). Whilst laudable, we can also
reﬂect on the possibility that these eﬀorts also render us guilty of
a reductionist approach within our own project governance and
operationsthatviewstheinclusionofwomenasproofofinclusivity.
Similarly,inWASHandgenderinterventions,someco-authors
would point to empirical research (see, for example, Mommen
et al., 2017 ) that highlights the transformational potential of
women’s inclusion and leadership in decision-making structures.
This tends to focus on the local level e.g., on inclusion in water
committees or the creation of water user associations and is an
important dimension of work on water security for some co-
authors.Othersaremoreconvincedbyevidencethatdemonstrates
that the transformational potential of such inclusion is limited
and often weak ( Cleaver and Toner, 2006 ;Adams et al., 2018 ),
and that local participation is not a transformational silver bullet
for social marginalization ( Cooke and Kothari, 2001 ), despite it
being a persistent focus of development interventions. A feminist
ethics of care undertaken through a socio-ecological lens supports
a more nuanced reﬂection, for instance, on the presumption that
“women” could ever be understood as a singular group in relation
to water (in)security. From her research in Bangladesh, Sultana
(2020) asks why poor women are more often expected to organize
and deliver their own water services (and often pay more per
unit for them), than the middle-class women with piped water
supplies to their homes? The issue of who has access to, and
control of, water security is complex and multifaceted. We must
not overlook the factors such as the gap between the rich and
destitute, and discrepancies in governance systems ( Gupta and
Lebel,2020 ).InourworkinMalaysia,wherewaterisastatematter
in which there exist contradictions in the governing structure, the
willingness of higher income households to pay for water ﬁltering
systems (because of better domestic water quality) is higher than
that of lower income groups ( Awang et al., 2020 ), which results in
inequalitiesinaccesstosaferwater.Despite the challenges of time and space to establishing shared
vocabularies and objectives, it is also important to highlight the
potentialforcomparative,cross-country,interdisciplinarylearning
and reﬂection around the similar-but-diﬀerent challenges of water
(in)security that emerge from an international partnership like
the Hub. We have so far been able to observe, for instance,
how indigenous groups who are politically and geographically
marginalized in Malaysia and Colombia diﬀerentially engage with
governanceandlegalstructurestoclaimrightstolandandwaterin
ways that have revealed surprising commonalities given the very
diﬀerent socio-economic, religious, and political contexts. How
then do we build on this new understanding, supporting learning
around the relationship between the human and non-human
world that work by Colombian colleagues have revealed, and
perhaps adapt that to support work with indigenous communities
inMalaysia?
Similarly, emergent ﬁndings from our Hub’s research of
informalsettlementsinAddisAbabaandNewDelhidrawattention
to class and ethnicity dynamics that shape how diﬀerent groups
accesswater,despitevastlydiﬀerentsocio-economiccontexts.How
do the lessons from research on water basins in informal urban
and peri-urban areas travel between contexts? We hope to be able
to test the value of these dual lenses by building more nuanced
intersectional dialogues between colleagues in New Delhi and
AddisAbaba.
The challenge here is not that we might collectively disagree
on how best to tackle intersectional inequality in water security
research and implementation. It is that within the time and
space constraints of conventional research models, which tend
to favor technical approaches to problem-solving delivered in
set time frames, rather than contextual and situated approaches,
our capacity to negotiate shared meaning that shapes research
design across dispersed geographical and disciplinary contexts is
severelyconstrained.
Concluding thoughts: moving beyond
bureaucratisation and technical ﬁxes
… or what we’ve learned (and done) to
make our partnerships better
In the Hub, we have always been keen to ask better and
more nuanced questions about who has “access” to water and
who has “control”, and how we set out to transform the current

are not all at the same place and or on the same page on these
issues.Thelessonhereisthatsituated,contextualandintersectional

Putting in place such processes are, however, constrained,
as we have demonstrated, by the imperatives of funding that
render the creation and nurturing of such processes as almost
insurmountable challenges. What are the lessons then from our
experiencesforglobal-levelresearchonwater(in)security?Howdo
we learn and build on these conceptualisations moving forward?
Within the Hub’s processes and management, we have ensured
that structures are in place to support considerations of gender
and intersectionality, even though some of these interventions
have felt like a “tick box” because time, space, geographies, and
pandemics have limited our ability to generate shared meaning
aroundhowwecollectivelyunderstandcomplexsocialphenomena.
As we move to our legacy stage, internally evaluating our success
in this area is as important as evaluating our research outcomes,
and the Hub will conduct an internal audit of how we have
approached intersectionality within our collaboration to improve
ourfuturepartnerships.
For water in(security) research more broadly, we know that
partnership needs to be move beyond well-established facts
around “water work” to think through how we come together to
actually address this unequal burden—what does an international
partnership oﬀer to our collective knowledge-building eﬀorts?
We have found that we can make substantive contributions to
unsettling the tendency to perceive water insecurity as a universal
experience in a ﬂattened place called the “Global South”. Instead,
we are committed to building comparative insights across our
partnership contexts that support the achievement of SDG6 but
in ways that build intersectional, dynamic and situated critiques
of “water work” through the application of feminist ethics and
ecological justice lenses. Using a feminist ethics of care combined
with a socio-ecological justice lens also allows us to identify the
waysinwhichgender,despiteODAguidancetothecontrary,isnot
theonlyformofinequalitythatdeservesourattention.Ouraimin
the ﬁnal year of the project is to bring these diﬀerent perspectives
intodialogue.
The key is that these comparative reﬂections are not one-sided
nor linear; instead, we seek to ask how the values we express
around water and questions of power and inequality are linked
with each other. One of the emergent issues in the Hub’s work
is that understanding water (in)security is complex, spanning
sectors and geographies, so the relative insecurity of a particular
actor or stakeholder may not be understood in isolation. We
must contextualize questions of relative (in)security wherein our
understanding is buﬀeted by interactions of populations with, for
instance, rapid urbanization and poor infrastructure, or where
gendered socialization and feminisation of roles intersect with
diﬀerences in age, class, geographic location, religion and maritalstatus in ways that not only shape vulnerability but also provide
insight into how people challenge unequal power relations. This
article has been a deliberation around how this GCRF Hub
addressesaninternaldilemmaforprojectsworkingacrosscontexts
and disciplines, but with the hope that our transparency about the
opportunitiesandchallengesofinternationalpartnershipwillyield
importantinsightsforfutureworkonwatersecurity.
