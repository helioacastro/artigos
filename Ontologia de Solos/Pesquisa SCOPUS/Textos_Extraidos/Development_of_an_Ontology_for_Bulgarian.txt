I.  INTRODUCTION  
Agriculture is an important sector in the economy o f 
Bulgaria. Increasing attention is being given to th e 
development of concepts and tools that utilize vari ous 
technologies and systems for automation and optimiz ation of 
agricultural processes. This process of automation,  
facilitation, and improvement of processes in agric ulture is 
known as smart farming or precision agriculture. Ap proaches 
to implementing smart farming include the use of a suitable 
combination of sensors, data collection devices, th e Internet 
of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and others, aimed 
at enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and sust ainability of 
agricultural operations. Sensors are used to gather  information 
on various parameters in the agricultural process, such as soil, 
moisture, temperature, and plant growth. This data is analyzed 
to make informed decisions and take appropriate act ions in 
crop cultivation. 
The goal of this article is to present the use of o ntologies 
in the context of intelligent agriculture. The rese arch is part of 
the intelligent farming platform called ZEMELA [1].  The 
architecture of ZEMELA includes an intelligent assi stant [2] 
that assists farmers in cultivating various crops b y providing 
them with information about plant growth and any in cidental 
events that occur during cultivation. To perform an alyses on 
the state of agricultural crops, the assistant reli es on 
foundational knowledge about the physiological deve lopment 
of crops [3], plant taxonomy [4], environmental con ditions, 
and more. This knowledge is stored in the form of o ntologies, 
frames, and other structures within the ADK center,  which is 
a component of the ZEMELA architecture. 
A core part of the ADK Center comprises ontologies that 
store fundamental knowledge about the cultivation o f various 
agricultural crops. The ontologies in the Center ar e divided 
into three main types - domain ontologies, event on tologies, 
and task ontologies. • Domain ontologies contain structured knowledge 
commonly accepted in the field of plant science. 
This includes knowledge about plant taxonomy, 
soil characteristics, and others. 
• Event ontologies contain knowledge about the 
cultivation of various agricultural crops. This 
includes the developmental stages of plants and 
the conditions under which they transition from 
one phase to another. Each crop has its own 
dedicated event ontology. Additionally, these 
ontologies describe various emergency events 
that may occur during crop cultivation, such as 
drought, disease outbreaks, pest infestations, and 
others. 
• Task ontologies are related to the activities that 
farmers need to perform in response to specific 
events. These activities include transitioning 
crops from one phase to another or carrying out 
necessary tasks during emergency events. 
Examples of such tasks include spraying with 
various pesticides or herbicides, irrigation, 
fertilization, and others. 
In the article, we will focus in detail on one of t he 
ontologies related to soil types in Bulgaria. The o ntology 
presents knowledge about soil types as well as info rmation 
about different regions with soils in Bulgaria that  are suitable 
for cultivating various types of crops. 
II.  STATE OF THE ART  
Different crops have varying requirements for soil in terms 
of texture, structure, pH value, drainage, and nutr ient content. 
Farmers pay particular attention to the characteris tics of the 
soil in which they will cultivate a specific crop i n order to 
achieve optimal yields. They also focus on preservi ng the 
soil's characteristics and nutrient levels from a f ertilization 
perspective. In this regard, numerous developments exist. 
The International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) is an 
international society that brings together scholars  and 
professionals in the field of soil science. They ha ve resources 
and publications related to soil classification and  
characteristics [5]. The World Soil Information (IS RIC) is a 
global center for soil information that provides da ta, maps, and 
online services related to soils. They have online resources 
and databases that present soil types [6]. The Euro pean Soil

Data Centre (ESDAC) is a soil information center es tablished 
by the European Commission. They provide data, maps , and 
tools that aid in the analysis and understanding of  soil 
resources in Europe [7]. 
There are also numerous ontologies developed for so il 
taxonomy, soil properties, and soil content, intend ed for 
various purposes and fields. In [8], the authors pr esent an 
ontology for soil characteristics relevant to road construction 
and infrastructure. The authors of [9] present an o ntology of 
soil taxonomy in India. In [10], an ontology is cre ated for 
storing detailed information about soil composition  with 
various minerals. The ontology provides structured and 
formalized knowledge that can be extracted for diff erent 
models, ultimately resulting in crop recommendation s and 
suitable soil compositions. 
In this article, an ontology for soils in Bulgaria will be 
presented, which also includes agro-climatic region s with 
soils in Bulgaria suitable for cultivating differen t crops. 
III.  BULGARIAN SOILS ONTOLOGY & AGRO -CLIMATIC 
ZONING  
We are not aware of the existence of another ontolo gy 
focused on the study of soils regarding the locatio n of Bulgaria 
and the so-called agro-climatic zoning of plant cro ps. The 
ontology itself is developed in Protégé OWL-ontolog y 
development environment [11].  
It includes a total of 787 axioms, 295 logical axio ms, 161 
declaration axioms, 123 classes, 6 object propertie s, 10 data 
properties, 20 individuals and 5 types annotation p roperties 
used (rdfs:comment, schema:image, source, rdfs:labe l on 
Bulgarian and on English, and rdfs:seeAlso). The on tology is 
being developed and is still a work in progress. 
A.  Class hierarchy 
The class hierarchy in the ontology for Bulgarian s oils 
follows the Taxonomic List of Soils in Bulgaria (ac cording to 
the FAO World System) by Professor Doctor Nino Nino v 
[12], and regarding the zoning of crops and their s uitability – 
the Bulgarian National Soil Survey’s studies [13].  
The current state of the Bulgarian soils ontology ( as 
metrics) is presented on Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 1.   Metrics of the Bulgarian soils ontology 
The ontology includes a taxonomy of the soils on th e 
territory of Bulgaria. They are used as predominant  types of 
soils in the descriptions of the agro-climatic zoni ng of popular 
plant crops like wheat - also including humus conte nt, level of benignity of the soil in view of the plant cultures . Soils are 
divided into two main types - azonal and zonal. For  example, 
fertile chernozems belong to zonal soils. They are widespread 
in Northern Bulgaria, about 20% of the total area o f the 
country [12]. An illustration of the taxonomy of al l soil types 
represented as classes and some other classes is de picted in 
Fig. 2. Several classes (namely Plant, 
AgroclimaticZoningOfPlantCulture, Soil, Location, C limate ) 
are subclasses of the base class owl:Thing  – and some of them 
also have their subclasses. Each class is accompani ed by 
additional information, which includes labels in tw o 
languages. Some classes are described with comments , 
pictures and links to additional sources of informa tion. The 
information included as comments and pictures is pr esented 
also with source  property. 
 
Fig. 2.  Main class hierarchy  
Disjointness axioms are attached, which means that two 
classes with no possible instance belonging to both  must be 
clearly stated. This is because of the ‘Open World 
Assumption’, which is one of the bases of Ontology 
Engineering in OWL. For the same reason, in the des criptions 
of some of the classes (e.g. Soil, AzonalSoil, ZonalSoil , etc.) 
the so-called ‘covering axioms’ were used. For inst ance, the 
class Soil  is described with axiom as being either AzonalSoil  
or ZonalSoil , which means that the class is defined only by a 
specific set of classes.  
Most of the classes are primitive (e.g. 
EutricGleysolsAzonalSoil ), i.e. they have only necessary 
conditions, while there are also defined classes - with

necessary and sufficient conditions, for example, 
WheatSoilZoning (Fig. 3),  which is defined class and also 
enumerated class with a list of its possible indivi duals.

B.  Object properties 
Object properties are these that are used to connec t class 
of individuals with other class of individuals, or a specific 
individual with others. The object properties in th e ontology 
are: accordingToPlant, growsWellIn, hasClimate, 
isLocatedIn, isSuitableForGrowing and withPredomina nt . 
They have further characteristics. For example, growsWellIn  
is irreflexive property, with domain – class Plant , and range – 
class Soil.  Its inverse property is isSuitableForGrowing (also 
irreflexive). The accordingToPlant  property is functional and 
inverse functional, with the class 
AgroclimaticZoningOfPlantCulture as domain and the class 
Plant as range. 
C.  Data properties 
Data property’s purpose is to connect a class of in dividuals 
(or individual) with value from a specific data typ e. The data 
properties in the ontology are: hasBenignity (with sub-
properties hasGreatestBenignity and hasLowestBenignity) , 
hasHumusContentPercentage  (with sub-properties 
hasAtLeastHumusContentPercentage  and 
hasTheBiggestHumusContentPercentage ), hasLatitude, 
hasLongitude, hasOptimalTimeForSowing and  рН.   
There are criteria which describe the most benefici al soil 
for concrete plant culture. Therefore, the 
hasHumusContentPercentage  property is included, and 
annotated with metadata type ‘label’ on Bulgarian a nd English 
languages. Its domain is the 
AgroclimaticZoningOfPlantCulture  class, but its range is the 
following axiom: xsd:double[>= "0.0"^^xsd:double , <= 
"100.0"^^xsd:double] .  
Another important property for the concept is 
hasBenignity . Its domain is the class 
AgroclimaticZoningOfPlantCulture , and its range is the 
following axiom: xsd:integer[>= 0 , <= 100].  Some other properties in the ontology are hasLongitude  and hasLatitude , 
with domain – the classes Soil  and 
AgroclimaticZoningOfPlantCulture, and range – specific 
value from a data type decimal. 
D.  Individuals 
The specific agro-climatic regions of plant culture s are 
presented as individuals. For example, the 
TwelfthWheatRegion  individual (on Fig. 4, illustrated using 
Protégé’s OntoGraf plug-in) is an instance of the 
WheatSoilZoning  class. Its description corresponds to the 
following axiom: WheatSoilZoning and (withPredominant 
some (ChromicLuvisolsZonalSoil or 
GleyicChernozemsZonalSoil or PlanosolsZonalSoil or 
VetricZonalSoil)).  Typically, they contain 1.5% humus, and 
the benignity from the subtypes of soil in the regi on varies 
from 62 to 83 points [13].

Similarly, other agro-climatic regions of plant cul tures are 
described, using the study by the Bulgarian Nationa l Soil 
Survey [13] (in the ontology there are also attache d assertions 
as rdfs:comments from the National Soil Survey’s si te). 
Illustratively, the FirstWheatRegion  individual and its 
annotations, descriptions and property assertions a re 
presented on Fig. 5.

IV.  REASONING  
 The 16 th  wheat specific agro-climatic regions are 
individuals of the class WheatSoilZoning , but the class itself 
has also 3 subclasses, namely: 
WheatRegionWithHighBenignity, 
WheatRegionWithLowdBenignity, 
WheatRegionWithMidBenignity,  which are described as 
equivalent classes with necessary and sufficient co nditions – 
similar to the following axiom: hasBenignity some 
xsd:integer[>= 64 , < 100] . The range is conditional, 
according to the individual agro-climatic zoning be nignity 
values. 
After a reasoning process with the Hermit Reasoner [14] 
(which as mentioned in [15] is fast and accurate at  ontology 
classification Reasoner), some individual agro-clim atic 
regions are deduced as individuals of the defined c lasses 
(illustrated on Fig. 6).  
 
Fig. 6.  WheatRegionWithHighBenignity class reasoning This is due to the fact they are described with axi oms by 
using the same data property, connecting the indivi dual with 
value corresponding to the range in class’s conditi on (which 
is not only necessary, but sufficient as mentioned) . Therefore, 
they meet this condition and can be considered as i ts instances. 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
The article introduces a unique Bulgarian soil onto logy 
designed to classify and categorize soil types with in the 
country. This ontology is a valuable resource for f armers as it 
provides insights into soil suitability for various  crops based 
on criteria such as humus content and benignity. Th rough 
reasoning processes, it allows for the classificati on of agro-
climatic regions based on soil characteristics, fac ilitating 
precise agricultural planning. 
Furthermore, the article emphasizes that the soil o ntology 
is an ongoing project. This suggests that there are  plans for 
future development and refinement of the ontology. This 
ongoing work could involve expanding the ontology t o 
include additional soil properties, incorporating n ew research 
findings, or enhancing its usability for farmers an d 
researchers. 
In summary, the Bulgarian soil ontology not only se rves 
as a current tool for agricultural decision-making but also 
signifies a commitment to its continued improvement  to meet 
evolving agricultural needs. The soil ontology deve loped for 
agriculture could have applications beyond farming,  
potentially in the field of building foundations in  architecture.
