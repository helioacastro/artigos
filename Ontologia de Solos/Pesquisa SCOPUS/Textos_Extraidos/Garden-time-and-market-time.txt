CzechiaABSTRACT
This paper combines two fast-developing perspectives on food provision: diverse economies and temporality. 
Building on an in-depth study of urban gardening in Czechia, we show that non-market economies play a central 
role in household food practices and that their specific temporality shapes how other parts of a household ’s 
diverse food economy are mobilised at certain times and for certain purposes. Following the diverse economies 
approach of reading for difference and not dominance, this paper investigates the interrelations and hierarchies 
among market, alternative market, and non-market food economies on the household level. We decentre the 
presumed dominance of market-based provisioning by showing that gardeners ’ food behaviours are crucially 
shaped by their engagement with food self-provisioning (FSP), which creates particular understandings of food 
quality. What is more, the cyclical, natural time of gardening seasons determines the social rhythm of food 
provisioning in a contemporary urban context. This provides a counter-narrative to the dominant account about 
the dislodging of cyclical time embedded in natural processes by modern, accelerated time, with the former 
carrying a lower value than the latter. Finally, we engage with temporality on a discursive level as we coun-
terpose our case of traditional FSP against the fascination with novelty permeating much of the search for 
alternative foodways. With this, we contribute to the debate on the temporality underpinning the ideas of 
capitalist modernity as well as post-capitalist prefiguration.
1.Introduction
This paper brings together two fast-developing bodies of literature: 
diverse (food) economies (Wilson, 2013; Cameron and Wright, 2014; 
Sarmiento, 2017; Rosol, 2020; Vincent and Feola, 2020 ) and temporality 
of food provisioning (Aistara, 2014; Mazac and Tuomisto, 2020; Taylor, 
2018 ), which have, so far, developed largely in parallel rather than in 
dialogue. This is surprising given the increasing level of attention to food 
provisioning in the diverse economies scholarship (¯Cajka and Novotný, 
2022; Gritzas and Kavoulakos, 2016 ) and the centrality of natural cycles 
and social rhythms to food provisioning.
In this paper, we address this lacuna and add a temporal dimension 
to the diverse economies scholarship by exploring interactions between 
diverse food economies on the household level. This endeavour provides 
insights concerning the hierarchy of food sources as understood by 
practitioners, and the role of time and seasonality as key ordering elements of their food-related behaviours. To pursue this agenda, we 
draw empirically on an in-depth study of the practices of households 
engaged in urban gardening. The paper ’s key empirical finding is that 
the experience of food growing combined with the seasonality of this 
food source shapes the way other parts of a household ’s diverse food 
economy are mobilised at certain times and for certain purposes. This, in 
turn, advances a novel way of thinking about temporality in relation to 
diverse (food) economies.
Socio-economic relations have become an increasingly important 
consideration in research concerned with more environmentally sus-
tainable and socially just ways of food provisioning (often labelled 
Alternative Food Networks or AFNs). Unlike industrial agriculture and 
corporate supply chains focused on food commodification and profit 
maximisation, promoters and practitioners of AFNs pursue a wider set of 
interrelated objectives that transcend profit. AFNs can foreground 
distinctive economic relations based on solidarity and the

acknowledgement of the often hidden social and environmental costs of 
food (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ). At the same time, these initiatives are 
intertwined in complex relations with the neoliberal economy 
(Arguelles et al., 2017; McClintock, 2014 ) as their practical functioning 
often relies on monetised, market-based transactions (Rosol, 2020; 
Wilson, 2013 ).
The diverse economies approach, based on the work of J. K. Gibson- 
Graham (2008) , offers a useful tool for interrogating the economic di-
versity of food provisioning and can ‘clarify the extent to which AFNs 
perform the economy otherwise ’ (Rosol, 2020, p. 68). Diverse econo -
mies scholars have explored food spaces that strive to operate in 
explicitly non-capitalist ways, such as food and land cooperatives 
(Rosol, 2020 ), public refrigerators (Morrow, 2019 ), kitchens preparing 
meals from food that would otherwise be wasted (Ulug and Trell, 2019; 
Wilson, 2013 ), community supported agriculture (CSA) schemes offer-
ing non-monetary payment options (Wilson, 2013 ), and initiatives 
reclaiming urban spaces as food commons (Morrow and Martin, 2019 ). 
Another stream of literature has documented food practices that do not 
explicitly aim to foster non-capitalist economies or alternative food 
systems, but that practically operate on the margins of the market 
domain and contribute to environmental and social sustainability, e.g., 
food sharing (Davies et al., 2017; Holmes, 2018 ) or food self- 
provisioning (FSP) (Kosnik, 2018; Mincyt le et al., 2020 ). These 
everyday practices, previously conceptualised as ‘quiet sustainability ’ 
(Smith and Jehli ¯cka, 2013 ) or ‘quiet activism ’ (Pottinger, 2017 ), are the 
focus of this paper.
Scholarly engagements with these and similar everyday food prac-
tices allow ‘unnoticed actors such as time to emerge ’ (Taylor, 2018, p. 
291). Indeed, time is a key, yet often implicit dimension in the debates 
on diverse food economies (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ). On the one hand, 
the fast pace of Western modernity dictates the centrality of convenience 
in food provision: acquiring, preparing, and consuming food needs to fit 
consumers ’ busy lifestyles (Daniels and Glorieux, 2015; Jackson et al., 
2006 ). Global food supply and just-in-time delivery models leave little 
room for the natural temporality of agricultural production (Bruce and 
Castellano, 2017 ). On the other hand, scholars have begun to recognise 
the distinctive temporalities of more sustainable ways of food produc -
tion and consumption and explore (re)connections with nature ’s cyclical 
rhythms (Phillips, 2020; Schoneboom, 2013 ). Sustainable agriculture 
entails higher time investment in farming practices such as soil care, 
composting, or seed saving, which might not translate into short-term 
profits but can ensure long-term sustainability (Morrow and Davies, 
2021; Pottinger, 2018; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). Seasonal and local 
diets exemplify the role of place and time in sustainable food con-
sumption, which is most explicitly epitomised by the Slow Food move -
ment (Murdoch and Miele, 2004 ). Last but not least, research has 
scrutinised the time and (often gendered) labour demands of more 
sustainable food provisioning (Parker and Morrow, 2017; Szabo, 2011 ), 
echoing debates on care and social reproduction long established in 
feminist scholarship (DeVault, 1991; Van Esterik, 1999 ).
Apart from this practical temporality embedded in the performances 
of sustainable food production and consumption, we notice a discursive, 
historical temporality concerned with change and continuity (Ingold, 
1993 ). Through its predominantly Western provenance, the search for 
alternative foodways is implicitly grounded in the Euromodern time 
ontology and its linear ideas about progress. This locates the benefits of 
AFNs (whether in the form of environmental sustainability or social 
wellbeing) in an unspecified, more or less distant future, emphasising 
the innovativeness of these initiatives (Schmid and Taylor Aiken, 2023 ). 
Such future-oriented hope underpins the logic of prefiguration 
(Tornaghi and Dehaene, 2020; Zanoni, 2020 ) metaphorically summar -
ised as ‘sowing the seeds ’ of more inclusive and sustainable futures 
(Pottinger, 2017 ; Smith, 2019 ; our quotation marks).
Simultaneously, food provisioning practices associated with more 
sustainable lifestyles, such as gardening, foraging, food sharing, pre-
serving, and cooking from scratch, can draw on past-oriented time ontologies. These can manifest themselves in nostalgic and romanticis -
ing ‘back-to-the-land ’ sentiments (such as Michael Pollan ’s [2009, p. 
148] plea not to eat ‘anything your great grandmother wouldn ’t 
recognise as food ’). In other cases, association with the past has been 
used to delegitimise traditional food practices as backwards and resid-
ual. Such negative framings have pervaded early accounts of FSP and 
other non-market food economies in Central and Eastern Europe. These 
practices were discursively associated with the failed socialist regime,3
and expected to disappear with the development of the market economy 
(Dan¯ek et al., 2022 ). However, these expectations grounded in the linear 
temporality of modernisation have been countered by the continuous 
relevance of these practices throughout the region ’s economic trans -
formations (Jehli ¯cka et al., 2013; Pungas, 2019 ). These examples show 
that the position of food practices in historical time is part of the process 
of their valuation (Heuts and Mol, 2013 ).
This paper addresses both the practical and the discursive tempo -
rality of diverse food economies. Drawing on research on FSP in Brno, 
Czechia, we advance three arguments. First, we underline the impor -
tance of engaging, as scholars, with already existing and traditionally 
established forms of food provisioning, to balance the search for novel 
solutions which hold an (uncertain) promise of a future food alternative 
(Schmid and Taylor Aiken, 2023 ). Second, by taking seriously Gibson- 
Graham ’s (2008) invitation to read for difference and not dominance, 
we explore the interrelations and hierarchies among market, alternative 
market, and non-market food economies on the household level. To 
decentre the perceived hegemony of market-based provisioning, we take 
the non-market practice of FSP as a starting point for our research. 
Third, we view the seasonal rhythms of gardening as a driving force 
shaping household food practices far beyond the space of the garden and 
the growing season.
2.Reading food economies for difference
The search for more sustainable foodways has found useful 
grounding in Gibson-Graham ’s (2008) diverse economies theory, which 
problematises the hegemony of capitalism as the dominant economic 
form and instead makes visible other, co-existing economic forms. In 
their famous iceberg metaphor, Gibson-Graham (2006) map economic 
diversity on a spectrum depicting (i) the market-based capitalist econ-
omy characterised by profit-oriented enterprise and wage labour as the 
tip of the iceberg, with a plethora of (ii) alternative market, labour, and 
enterprise arrangements, and (iii) non-market economic practices 
located in the larger, submerged part of the iceberg.
What seems to be particularly inspiring in the diverse economies ’ 
conceptual toolkit is Gibson-Graham ’s invitation to read for ‘difference 
and possibility rather than dominance and predictability ’ (Gibson-Gra -
ham ’s, 2008, p. 626). In other words, to explore the existing economic 
diversity without assuming the dominant position of capitalism. This 
analytical move ‘enables researchers to avoid approaching AFNs as the 
quixotic, vestigial, or doomed other to conventional, i.e., capitalist food 
systems understood as monolithic and singular ’ (Sarmiento, 2017, p. 
488). Indeed, the diverse economies theory presents a useful vantage 
point for the search for more sustainable food systems, as was recently 
highlighted by Marit Rosol (2020) and Olga Vincent and Giuseppe Feola 
(2020) , and anticipated in earlier works (Cameron and Wright, 2014; 
Lee, 2006; Sarmiento, 2017; Wilson, 2013 ).
This critical economic lens is relevant in two ways. First, the indus -
trial food system, which many AFNs seek to challenge, is closely inter-
twined with capitalism (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ). The high productivity 
model of the corporate-environmental food regime (Friedmann, 2005 ) 
not only reflects a profit and growth-oriented logic of capital 
3The history of FSP predates state socialism, with first allotment gardens 
being established in relation to early 20th century urbanisation. For a more 
detailed history of FSP in Czechia see Dan¯ek and Jehli ¯cka (2024) .L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

accumulation, but it also sustains the capitalist economy (Weis, 2010 ). 
Second, perhaps due to the fundamental role of agriculture in social 
reproduction, the agrifood sector presents fertile ground for ‘testing new 
ways of performing the economy otherwise ’ (Rosol, 2020, p. 55). 
Indeed, food is produced, distributed, and consumed in multiple ways, 
involving diverse forms of labour, markets, enterprises, property, and 
finance, whose relation to the corporate agrifood system cannot be 
presumed (Cameron and Wright, 2014 ).
As a result, AFNs present a productive empirical field for the devel -
opment of the diverse economies theory, particularly concerning its 
engagement with materiality. As pointed out by Eric Sarmiento, one of 
the common critiques of the diverse economies scholarship is its 
emphasis on the performativity of discourse, which ‘has long struck 
sceptical observers as overly abstract and logocentric ’ (Sarmiento, 2017, 
p. 489). This issue appears to be less prominent in diverse economies 
research on AFNs, which is typically ‘quite pragmatic and grounded ’ 
(ibid.). To confirm, our take on diverse economies in this paper centres 
on how they materialise in everyday food provisioning practices 
(Holmes, 2018 ) . Focusing on the material, i.e. food acquired by 
households from different sources, allows us to understand the impor -
tance of diverse food economies in both quantitative and qualitative 
terms.
Much of what we call ‘diverse food economies scholarship ’ (i.e., 
research applying the diverse economies theory to alternative ways of 
food provision) focuses on post-capitalist prefiguration (Chatterton, 
2016; Zanoni, 2020 ), that is, experiments that seek to embody a 
distinctive, post-capitalist form of economy. In this explorative, 
possibility-oriented fashion, the purpose of AFNs is not necessarily to 
solve questions of food provision at once. Instead, they identify possible 
pieces of future solutions (Sarmiento, 2017; Tornaghi and Dehaene, 
2020 ), often in the form of socially innovative reconfigurations of pro-
ducer –consumer relations.
In this project, post-capitalism is not understood in a temporal sense, 
as another stage following capitalism in the linear trajectory of devel -
opment. Instead, Tuomo Alhoj arvi and colleagues (2023) highlight post- 
capitalist politics as an ongoing practice of visibilising other than capi-
talist forms of economy that already exist. To make the departure from a 
developmentalist understanding of time even more explicit, we argue, 
scholarship on diverse food economies can find inspiration in traditional 
ways of food provision (see, e.g. Cameron and Wright, 2014 account of 
the diverse economies surrounding subsistence farming in the Majority 
World). Inspired by the assertion that ‘[s]ustainable food systems have 
already been in practice for millennia ’ (Mazac and Tuomisto, 2020, p. 
4), this paper focuses on practices which operate outside the market 
without explicitly opposing the capitalist food system. Including tradi-
tional practices in post-capitalist prefiguration allows us to explore the 
often implied but rarely addressed temporal dimension of economic 
diversity, while further questioning the centrality of capitalism and the 
Euromodern temporality.
3.Diverse temporalities of the food economy
The discursive intertwinements of capitalism with modernity and 
progress suggest that temporality is an important, albeit rarely explicit, 
dimension of economic diversity. Temporality scholars have linked the 
understanding of time as linear, teleological and quantifiable to pro-
cesses of capitalist production and Western colonialism (Valkenburg, 
2022, Hunfeld, 2022 ). This temporal ontology displaces alternative understandings of time, much like the discourse of capitalist dominance 
overlooks the submerged part of Gibson-Graham ’s iceberg. Indeed, 
diverse economies theory aligns with postdevelopment scholarship in its 
scepticism of linear narratives of progress (Gibson-Graham, 2005 ): 
economic diversity implies a diversity of temporalities. That said, the 
literature directly engaging with the temporality of diverse economies 
is, to our knowledge, fairly limited.4
Addressing this issue head-on, Vincent and Feola (2020) propose a 
more explicit questioning of temporality as an ontological dimension of 
economic diversity. While their argument aims at a broader applica -
bility, we find the question of time particularly pertinent to food econ-
omies. Food production is not divorced from the vagaries of biology, 
ecology, and climate, which are typically characterised by the cyclical 
time of circadian and seasonal rhythms (Goodman, 1999 ) – or what we 
will call ‘garden time ’. Nevertheless, the industrialisation of food pro-
duction, distribution, and consumption seeks to align these processes 
with the ‘predictable, homogenous and linear representations of time ’ 
(Vincent and Feola, 2020, p. 305) typical for Western modernity. The 
use of refrigeration, preservation, and packaging, as well as globalised 
retail alternating geographical regions, mould the organic and often 
uncertain temporalities of food into the streamlined temporality of in-
dustrial capitalism, which we refer to as ‘market time ’. The uninhibited 
growth dictated by the capitalist economy is made possible by a 
‘conspicuously short-sighted ’ time ontology and a ‘disregard for future 
temporalities ’ (Mazac and Tuomisto, 2020, p. 6), as this ‘spatio-tem -
poral rescaling of production ’ generates metabolic imbalances in other 
places and times (Pungas, 2019, p. 78).
Considering the temporality of alternative food markets evokes a 
greater complexity. Alternative forms of food provision may often relate 
to a contrasting time ontology: ‘relational ’, slowed down, and rejecting 
the acceleration of everyday practices (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ). 
However, when AFNs compete on capitalist markets, marketing, distri -
bution, and consumption of produce often come close to the accelerated 
temporality underpinning the market economy. For instance, Jane 
Dixon et al.’s (2007) research from Australia shows that ‘slow ’ (i.e., 
higher quality and higher environmental standards) foods are often only 
accessible by car (arguably a ‘fast’ mode of transportation) and cater for 
convenient consumption, whereas many fast food options are accessible 
to pedestrians and feature sit-in dining areas. This leads to contradic -
tions and hybridities the authors refer to as ‘slow food fast’ and ‘fast food 
slow ’ (Dixon et al., 2007, p. 138).
The non-market part of the diverse food economy, represented by 
practices such as gardening (Bhatti et al., 2009; Schoneboom, 2013; 
Taylor, 2018 ), gifting, gleaning, and foraging (Gibson-Graham, 2006 ), 
often embodies qualities such as deceleration, continuity, cyclicity, and 
repetition. In contrast to the ‘valorisation of speed ’ (Adam, 1998, in 
Taylor, 2018, p. 296) and erasure of seasonality typical for the ‘market 
time ’ of the industrial food supply, ‘garden time ’ is characterised by the 
centrality of seasonality, the rhythms of sunrise and sunset, cycles of 
growth, and the impossibility of fundamentally accelerating tasks of 
caring for plants and soil (Taylor, 2018 ).
Historically, the dominant scholarly (but also public) discourse on 
the development of time has been that of nature-related, cyclical time 
being displaced by linear, Euromodern industrial/clock time (Taylor, 
2018 ). The intensification and acceleration of modern time relate to the 
development of capitalism (Castells, 1996; Castree, 2009 ) and the 
colonial displacement of indigenous temporalities (Hunfeld, 2022; 
Valkenburg, 2022 ). Specifically in the food regime studies, this 
4The Handbook of Diverse Economies (Gibson-Graham & Dombroski, 2020 ) 
includes several cursory mentions of temporality in terms of reciprocity and 
finance, food-related slowness and the slower pace of labour in the anti-mafia 
enterprise. Otherwise, temporal notions are absent from the Handbook 
which, with 58 chapters and 546 pages, presents the gamut of current debates 
within the diverse economies scholarship.L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

discourse is echoed in suggestions about industrial agriculture 
privileging ‘circulation time of commodity over natural reproduction 
time ’ (McMichael, 2015, p. 307). Unsurprisingly, the concern about 
uniform, linear quantitative and accelerated clock time replacing ‘the 
heterogeneous patterns of traditional agricultural work entrained to 
nature ’s diverse rhythms ’ or ‘cyclic-qualitative ’ time (Taylor, 2018, p. 
295) is also echoed in studies of (allotment) gardening (Schoneboom, 
2013; Taylor, 2018 ).
Alongside these accounts, other scholars have problematised the 
notion of a straightforward substitution of cyclical time with linear time, 
pointing out the coexistence of alternative time ontologies. Apart from 
the diverse temporalities embedded in indigenous ways of knowing and 
being, Govert Valkenburg (2022) refers to the continued existence of a 
diversity of temporalities even in Western societies. For instance, per-
formance, ritual and learning inevitably rely on repetition, pointing to 
the relevance of a circular notion of time. Rhythm, sequencing and 
temporal ordering have received attention in scholarship examining 
consumption as a social practice (Southerton, 2013 ), where food prac-
tices in particular seem to demand specific temporal conditions in terms 
of coordination, timing, tempo and duration. Encounters with more- 
than-human actors serve as another reminder of coexisting temporal -
ities (Gibson and Warren, 2020; Phillips, 2020 ).
As a result, people navigate multiple temporalities in their daily lives 
(Valkenburg, 2022 ), as is also illustrated in Abigail Schooneboom ’s 
(2018 ) ethnography of allotment gardening and its temporal in-
tersections with the pace of modern (work) life. On the one hand, the 
time requirements of gardening have been documented as a barrier, 
particularly for the younger generation (Mincyt le et al., 2020; Pungas, 
2023 ). On the other hand, though, ‘the texture of time spent at the 
allotment ’ (Schoneboom, 2018, p. 361) seems fundamentally different, 
as they create ‘non-obligated time ’ (ibid.) spent in the flow of gardening 
tasks and contemplation.
In this paper, we use the specific temporality of gardening as a 
starting point from which we add to the literature that problematises the 
narrative of Euromodern linear time eclipsing ‘traditional ’, cyclical, and 
nature-related time. Our contribution to this scholarship focuses on 
gardens as sources of food and thus spaces which exist within, and 
interact with, the diverse food economy. The temporal lens adds another 
dimension to the diverse economies as a performative epistemological 
and ontological project. If perpetuating the hegemonic position of the 
modernist time leads to a delegitimisation of other temporalities 
(Hunfeld, 2022; Valkenburg, 2022 ), highlighting the coexistence and 
interactions of concomitant diverse temporalities has the opposite ef-
fect. It decentres the ‘market time ’ in the same way as visibilising eco-
nomic diversity decentres capitalism.
4.Methodology
This paper draws empirically on a qualitative study conducted in 
cooperation with 27 households5involved in FSP in Brno, Czechia ’s 
second largest city.6The sample included households that were not 
professional farmers but produced food for their own consumption in a 
garden adjacent to their home, on an allotment plot, or in a second-home 
garden. The size of the plots ranged from 200 to 2,000 m2 with diverse 
intensities of production. All households produced fruits and vegetables, 
which were the focus of our analysis and an inclusion criterion during 
the recruitment of participants. In addition, two gardeners kept bees, six 
had chickens for eggs, and two kept rabbits for meat. Households ranged 
from one to five people,7and most were represented by a female respondent, arguably due to the gendered nature of food provisioning 
work. The sampling aimed for diversity in terms of age and socio- 
economic status; however, respondents with university degrees were 
overrepresented.8
The goal of the research was to inventorise the diverse economies in 
which participants engage in order to acquire fruits and vegetables, and 
to understand their mutual interactions. To this end, participants were 
asked to record all fruits and vegetables that entered their household 
and their respective sources, (estimated) weight, and usage (see also 
Pourais et al., 2015 for a similar methodology). Using Gibson-Graham ’s 
(2006) diverse economies matrix, food sources were subsequently cat-
egorised as non-market (gardening, foraging, gifts), alternative market 
(farmers ’ markets, direct sales, and organic food shops), and market- 
based (supermarkets and grocery shops).9The same analytical lens 
was applied to the food that households distributed. Here, only non- 
market transactions (sharing, gifting, or exchange) were reported in 
the overwhelming majority of cases, as only one respondent sold small 
quantities of their produce. In addition, food usage included the cate-
gories of consumption, preserving, and storing for future use.
Assuming that seasonality would influence the use of the gardens as 
food sources, we structured the data collection in four rounds spread 
throughout the seasons of the year. In each season, participants kept 
food logs for a period of one month.10Food logs were accompanied by 
four to six semi-structured interviews per respondent. An introductory 
interview mapped their gardening practices and motivations as well as 
the practicalities of their household food provision. Subsequent in-
terviews were held at each seasonal round of data collection and served 
to test emerging interpretations, clarify ambiguities in the food logs11
and retain participants ’ commitment. The concluding interview 
reviewed the developments of respondents ’ food provisioning practices 
throughout the year and verified the interpretation of seasonal patterns.
The food logs provided a detailed insight into households ’ food 
provisioning strategies. These data offered a quantitative account of the 
material volume of diverse food economies at the household level, 
illuminating the much-debated question of the relevance and scale of 
non-market forms of food provision. Nonetheless, our research remains 
qualitative in nature, aiming to understand participants ’ motivations for 
the use of particular food sources and the practicalities of food provi -
sioning in daily life. In our results, we thus build from the quantitative 
evidence provided by the food logs to a more qualitative interpretation 
based on insights from the interviews.

transactions, and we are aware that it does not fully capture the diverse eco-
nomic relations fostered by each type of source (see Sovov ˘a, 2020 for a more 
elaborate discussion). Other studies (Holmes, 2018 ; Morrow, 2020 ; Rosol, 
2020 ; Wilson, 2013 ) provide greater nuance by unpacking economic practices 
in terms of labour, property, finance, and organisational layout. In comparison, 
our goal is not to deliver a granular analysis of different food economies, but 
instead to investigate their interactions on the household level – for which a 
somewhat coarser application of Gibson-Graham ’s categories serves well.
10Importantly, all data concerning food weight, source, and usage reported 
below relate to these four month-long periods only, not to the whole year.
11While food logs rely on respondents ’ self-reporting, we believe that they 
provide for a more accurate data than memory recall often used in consumer 
studies. The main challenges experienced during data collection related to re-
spondents ’ ability to estimate food quantities and to the sometimes blurry 
boundaries between different types of sources (e.g. gifting vs. buying from an 
acquaintance for a reduced price) and uses (e.g. own consumption vs. sharing in 
cases of closely related households) of food (see Sovov ˘a, 2020 for details).L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

economies of gardeners ’ households. Before that, however, we need to 
provide a brief inventory of the food sources households used, qualifying 
them as representing diverse food economies (section 5.1). This over-
view is accompanied by several important notes on the meanings re-
spondents associated with different types of sources (section 5.2). 
Finally, we draw out several arguments about the temporality of diverse 
food economies (section 5.1-5.3 ).
5.1. Diverse household food economies
Gardening households mobilise several approaches to obtaining 
fruits and vegetables that relate to the three types of transactions in the 
diverse economies matrix (Gibson-Graham, 2006 ). Table 1captures the 
types of sources households used during the four months of data 
collection. Market-based sources were most important, with supermar -
kets covering on average 43% of household consumption of fruits and 
vegetables. Nonetheless, the food logs also revealed the importance of 
acquiring fruits and vegetables outside the market, i.e. through FSP and 
gifting. On average, 31% of respondents ’ consumption was covered from 
their own gardens.
Alternative market sources were comparatively less significant, ac-
counting for 14% of the household fruit and vegetable consumption on 
average. The prevalence of more novel forms of AFNs, such as organic 
food shops or farmers ’ markets, was particularly low. The most signifi -
cant alternative market source was direct sales, i.e. instances when re-
spondents purchased food directly from producers. We note that these 
sources were often embedded in specific places and/or social relations, 
e.g. when respondents combined visiting relatives in the countryside 
with buying fruits and vegetables, or when those living on the city’s 
outskirts purchased food from nearby farms. The relations and meanings 
underpinning different types of food sources are further discussed in the 
next section.
5.2. Hierarchy of food sources
Previous research from Central and Eastern Europe has detailed the 
high appreciation for home-grown and home-made food in the region. 
This literature (e.g. Decker, 2018; Pungas, 2019; Trenouth and Tisen -
kopfs, 2015; Yotova, 2018 ) has unpacked a complex notion of food 
quality in which home-grown food is valued for its transparent origin 
and ‘natural ’ production methods, resulting in a superior taste, health -
iness and freshness. Our research confirms that these meanings are 
closely intertwined, and it relates them directly to respondents ’ 
embodied experience with food growing: 
I think that home-grown [food] is definitely of higher quality. For 
instance, I don’t use many chemicals. Other people may use chem -
icals in their gardens, and they have more beautiful, bigger vegeta -
bles. But is it better taste- or health-wise? I have seen how tomatoes 
are grown in Turkey, in those fields of polytunnels. Well, they ’re red, 
but they don’t have any flavour. Or if I buy strawberries now [in 
winter], they taste like beetroot. A strawberry, when you pick it in 
the garden, the sun is shining on it and it’s warm; you don’t get that 
taste even if you buy it on the market from a farmer, but if you have it 
warm, freshly picked, that’s something exquisite. And that’s exactly 
why I do it. (respondent 15)
Furthermore, our results resonate with existing scholarship from the 
region (e.g. Bilewicz and ˘Spiewak, 2019; Blumberg, 2014; Gabriel, 
2005; Mincyte, 2014 ), which shows a preference for socially based 
guarantees of quality over more formalised ones. When discussing 
farmers ’ markets, respondent 10 explained: 
One anyway doesn ’t know where it [i.e., food] comes from [at the 
farmers ’ market]. I don’t really have trust in it. I prefer to get 
something from an acquaintance, although I know that they can also 
use something [i.e., agrochemicals], or I don’t know exactly. I don’t dig into it, but I know that there is a person behind it, so I have more 
trust in it.
In summary, respondents ’ understanding of food quality related 
directly to their proximity to the food production. They valued their own 
produce for ‘knowing exactly what they put in it’ and they also had trust 
in the quality of food produced by people they personally knew, while 
being suspicious of longer and less transparent supply chains. Notably, 
food purchased in supermarkets was understood as having lower qual-
ity, and commonly described as ‘chemical ’ and ‘tasteless ’.
This results in a clear hierarchy of food sources which positions non- 
market food practices above market-based provisioning. Indeed, pur-
chasing food from market-based sources was framed explicitly as a last 
resort: 
I don’t necessarily need to grow everything; you can always ex-
change [food] with someone, or in the worst case, you buy it. 
(respondent 10)
Juxtaposing these understandings of food quality to the food log data 
shows that non-market food provision is not only quantitatively rele-
vant, but also perceived as the source of the best food. This challenges 
earlier literature which assumed that non-market food economies in 
Central and Eastern Europe would be replaced by commercial retail as 
the region ’s economic transformation advances on the linear develop -
ment trajectory towards capitalism (Dan¯ek et al., 2022 ).
However, respondents ’ perception of market-based sources seemed 
at odds with the purchases of fruits and vegetables in supermarkets. 
Even though market sources were framed as the worst in terms of food 
quality, they still provided most of the fruits and vegetables consumed. 
The next section unpacks this paradox by examining the temporality of 
households ’ diverse food economies.
5.3. The time of good food
The starting point of our argument regarding temporality consists of 
two premises. First, homegrown food is perceived as the best and, by 
extension, non-market sources are preferred over market-based food 
provision. Second, gardening is a seasonal practice, and non-market and 
alternative market food sources are generally subject to higher seasonal 
fluctuation than the globalised, market-based food supply. While these 
assertions might seem trivial, investigating their consequences for 
household food economies allows us to confirm the central position of 
non-market food sources, while highlighting the importance of season -
ality in the interactions of diverse food economies. Furthermore, we use 
this point to illustrate the steadfast influence of natural rhythms on the 
daily lives of urban professionals living in an industrialised country, thus 
disputing the assumed dominance of the accelerated linear time of 
capitalist modernity.
The organisation of the data collection into four rounds spread 
throughout the year allowed us to observe seasonal patterns in re-
spondents ’ food provisioning practices as well as their household diets. 
Unsurprisingly, the gardens played a major role during the summer 
season, as shown in Fig. 1. During this time, respondents purchased 
fewer fruits and vegetables, while their consumption of these foods 
increased.12On average, respondents covered 56 per cent of their fruit 
and vegetable consumption from their own production.13We also want 
to highlight that the amount of food harvested from the gardens 
12During the summer month of data collection, respondents consumed an 
average 28 kg of produce per person, compared to 19 kg in the spring, autumn 
and winter rounds.
13In comparison, the gardens covered 26% of household consumption in the 
spring, 18% in autumn and 12% in the winter round of data collection.L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

exceeded respondents ’ consumption. An average household shared and 
gifted 19 kg of home-grown food,14and preserved or stored another 20 
kg. The garden harvest dominated respondents ’ diets not only in terms 
of the amount, but also the types of fruits and vegetables consumed. The 
most consumed vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and 
zucchini) and fruits (apples, peaches, and grapes) were sourced almost 
exclusively from respondents ’ gardens.
Observing food provisioning patterns outside the summer abundance 
sheds light on the interactions of diverse food economies in respondents ’ 
households. We notice three coexisting patterns that illuminate the 
tension between the negative perception of market-based food sources 
and their continuous use. First, there is a clear increase in supermarket 
purchases in the autumn and winter rounds of data collection. This is 
explained as a way to supplement household needs after the (preferred) 
home-grown produce ceases to be available: 
I cook vegetables a lot. Now [in winter] I buy frozen mixes, for 
instance, green peas and carrots, and I buy lettuce and Chinese 
cabbage because I don’t have that from the garden now, so I need to 
buy it. (respondent 22)
Second, respondents developed numerous strategies to minimise the 
use of market-based food sources, which they associated with lower food 
quality. These crucially included preserving and storing foods from their 
own gardens or other non-market and alternative market sources: 
Even in winter, we didn ’t buy vegetables at all. We had some pickled 
beetroot of our own. I also fermented cabbage, some of my own and 
some I bought from a farmer. I have dried mushrooms, so [we eat] everything with mushrooms, the last of the pumpkins, lots of po-
tatoes, rice, lentils. (respondent 10)
The increase of direct sales in the autumn and winter rounds of data 
collection, as shown in Fig. 1, reflects bulk on-farm purchases intended 
to cover household consumption of more durable produce (most notably 
apples and potatoes) throughout the winter. Storing was importantly 
conditioned by the infrastructures available to individual households, 
inviting creative solutions but also shaping respondents ’ gardening 
choices: 
My parents have a really good cellar, where potatoes, beetroots and 
carrots and everything last easily until April. They store whatever 
they can. At our place, it wouldn ’t be possible. We have this city-type 
cellar. It’s not cold, and the humidity is also not good. So, they store 
it there, and then we bring it by five kilos. (respondent 9)
I try to grow things that can be stored. What cannot be stored, I only 
try to produce in quantities I can give away. For instance, when I 
plant new trees, I look at the durability of the fruits. (respondent 17)
These examples illustrate how FSP (but also other food sources) and 
eating are intertwined across long-term temporal scales. The fact that 
future harvests are envisioned months in advance during sowing and 
planting is intrinsic to the temporality of gardening. Storing and pre-
serving practices stretch this time-scale even further, often exceeding 
the span of a year: 
I regularly sow spinach in autumn; in the spring it sprouts by itself. It 
is low maintenance, but it is, for instance, five big boxes at once. So I 
keep some and I quickly distribute the rest to relatives, who process it 
for themselves. (…) It’s basically spinach for the whole year. I freeze 
a lot of it. (respondent 17)
Such long-term planning contrasts sharply with the notion of fast Table 1

14While we lack space in this paper to elaborate on the extensive networks of 
gifting and sharing, they add to the importance of non-market food provision by 
enhancing social resilience (Jehli ¯cka et al., 2019 ; Sovov ˘a et al., 2021 ).L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

food and the just-in-time delivery models of market-based provision. 
However, similar practices were routinised among gardeners, who 
developed them by trial and error over the years. Because of this, some 
respondents maintained a high level of self-sufficiency throughout the 
year, temporarily redistributing surplus produce from more plentiful 
seasons. In their food logs, stocks and preserves from past harvests 
overlapped with early crops of the new season, highlighting the cyclical 
nature of their food provisioning practices. For others, home-grown food 
was saved for special occasions, e.g. when respondent 25 made red 
currant jam for Christmas sweets and respondent 24 kept spinach in the 
freezer for next season ’s Easter stuffing.
Preserving and storing foods from ‘good sources ’ thus enabled re-
spondents to maintain their standards for good food, while additional 
purchases of fruits and vegetables in supermarkets ensured that their 
dietary needs were met. That said, the overall consumption of fruits and 
vegetables decreased, particularly in the winter and spring rounds of 
data collection, following the declining seasonal availability of (stored) 
home-grown food. The following quote by respondent 7 confirms that 
this adjustment results from the hierarchy of sources by food quality: 
I find it somehow logical, when it’s not there in the winter, why 
would I buy it in the supermarket? For instance, tomatoes and cu-
cumbers, why would I eat them and buy them when they are not 
tasty?
This brings us to the third pattern, namely the influence of garden 
seasonality on the composition of respondents ’ diets. Despite the di-
versity in food preferences among respondents ’ households, the food log 
data reveals shared seasonal patterns in their fruit and vegetable con-
sumption. Most notably, the consumption of particular crops declined 
once they stopped being available from the preferred sources. The 
aforementioned tomatoes are the most prominent example of this 
pattern: they were produced by all respondents, and were also often 
mentioned as a marker of difference in taste between home-grown and 
shop-bought food. Food logs confirmed high consumption of tomatoes, 
which was, however, limited almost exclusively to the time when they 
were available from the gardens. Although supermarkets offer tomatoes 
year-round, these do not meet the quality standards expected by 
gardeners.15
The seasonal eating pattern can thus be traced back to a preference 
for home-grown food. Fig. 2illustrates similar fluctuations in con-
sumption of several crops, which relate directly to their harvest time and 
shelf life: while strawberries, lettuce, zucchinis and tomatoes were eaten 
almost exclusively during, respectively, spring and summer, stored 
pumpkins and potatoes lasted until the autumn and winter rounds of 
data collection. The majority of these crops was obtained from re-
spondents ’ own gardens, gifts and direct sales, and respondents 
preferred reducing their consumption over obtaining them from ‘lower 
quality ’ market-based sources.
Such seasonal fluctuations were not observed in the consumption of 
crops that were commonly obtained from market-based sources. These 
crops were usually perceived as difficult to grow (e.g. carrots, cabbage) 
or easy to buy in good quality (e.g. onions). While the consumption of 
these foods remains comparatively more stable, some of the re-
spondents ’ accounts suggest a ripple effect of the garden rhythms. For 
instance, multiple respondents explained the summer peak in their 
consumption of (mostly shop-bought) onions by the need to use more 
onions for meals and preserves made with garden vegetables. Carrots 
and cabbage were consumed slightly more in autumn and winter, 
possibly also to compensate for the lack of other vegetables from the 
gardens. It thus appears that the seasonal availability of food from 
gardens drives changes in consumption, which also extend to foods from other sources and beyond the harvest period. In fact, the connection 
between perceived food quality, preference for non-market sources, and 
their seasonality makes for the strongest determinant of respondents ’ 
eating practices.
6.Discussion
In light of our findings, in this section, we revisit the three arguments 
formulated in the Introduction. The first one relates to temporal dis-
courses and the importance of engaging with the traditionally estab -
lished forms of food provisioning which exist in parallel – though not 
necessarily in opposition – to market-based provision. These forms are 
underrepresented in studies of diverse food economies, which often 
focus on novel initiatives that seek more explicitly to overcome the 
limitations of the capitalist food system. As Benedikt Schmid and Gerald 
Taylor-Aiken (2023, p. 511) point out, the dominant emphasis on nov-
elty has a dual effect – the ‘displacement from the present ’ that leads to 
ignoring ‘practices that already exist ’ and the implicit prioritisation of 
the future as the location of ‘new and hopeful practices ’.
This perspective is visible in literature describing the slow prolifer -
ation of ‘novel ’ AFNs such as community-supported agriculture, 
farmers ’ markets or organic food shops in Central and Eastern Europe 
(Spilkov ˘a, 2018 ), which our results indeed confirm. At the same time, 
we observe the existence of direct producer –consumer arrangements 
that are not driven by innovation but grounded in social relations and 
connections to place, and which others have similarly described as 
traditional (Tisenkopfs, 2017 ) or embedded (Goszczynski et al., 2019 ) 
food networks.
Zooming in on literature on urban food gardening, we notice an 
implicit, yet entrenched, temporality-based valuation, which positions 
‘innovative ’ AFNs (such as rooftop or community gardening projects) as 
distinctive from ‘traditional ’ allotment and home gardening. The former 
type is typically represented through a rhetoric of emergence and nov-
elty, which emphasises potential for future transformation (often 
pending questions about upscaling and economic viability; Schmid and 
Taylor Aiken, 2023 ). In this manner, the search for alternative food 
practices remains firmly embedded in the linear Euromodern time 
ontology (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ) and its ideas of progress.
Traditional forms of FSP in allotment and home gardens have been 
associated with temporality in a different manner, one that is, never -
theless, also related to linearity and modernisation. For a long time, 
rather than being framed as part of future-oriented, progressive de-
velopments, allotment and home gardening have been associated with a 
past-oriented temporality and primarily understood as a manifestation 
of backwardness (Dan¯ek et al., 2022; Pungas et al., 2022 ; Smith and 
Jehli ¯cka, 2013 ). This can be viewed as a specific variant of the ‘denial of 
coevalness ’ (Fabian, 2014 ), a situation in which a culture or community 
– in this case, a social group of home and allotment gardeners – is 
epistemologically marginalised (Valkenburg, 2022 ) on the basis of being 
seen as not sharing ‘our’ time. Conversely, acknowledging diversity in 
practices and their respective temporalities allows for their contempo -
raneous coexistence. Engaging with traditional forms of food provision 
thus expands the space of possibility for more equitable food economies. 
Furthermore, paying attention to temporal discourses adds an important 
dimension to the inventory of economic diversity as it helps shed light 
on practices that might be unrightfully overlooked due to their associ -
ation with the past (Sovov ˘a, Cima et al., forthcoming )).
This relates to our second argument, which concerns reading for 
difference and hence not making assumptions on the interrelations and 
hierarchies among diverse food economies. Engaging with traditional 
forms of FSP in Central and Eastern Europe shows the relevance of non- 
market food economies which exist alongside the wide availability of 
cheap and convenient foods and the region ’s broader transformations 
towards neoliberal capitalism. Our results reveal that direct and 
embodied experiences with food production shape gardeners ’ un-
derstandings of food quality, according to which the best food can be 15We could argue, following Heuts and Mol (2013) , that the experience of 
tomato growing not only educated gardeners in recognizing a good tomato, but 
it was in fact an intrinsic part of actively performing tomatoes as good.L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

obtained from sources which operate outside, or on the margins of, the 
market economy: FSP, gifts, or direct sales based on personal contacts.
Although our research is based on a small sample of 27 households, 
there is robust evidence of the widespread prevalence of FSP in Central 
and Eastern Europe: the share of the population growing some of their 
own food is 51 per cent in Czechia (Smutna et al., 2024 ), 36 per cent in 
Hungary (Balazs, 2016 ), 50 per cent in Croatia (Jehli ¯cka et al., 2021 ) 
and 54 per cent in Poland (Smith and Jehli ¯cka, 2013 ). Across these 
studies, participants from diverse socio-economic groups value 
gardening as a meaningful hobby, but also as a source of food of the 
highest quality. This source also feeds (literally and figuratively) vibrant 
networks of gifts and sharing, extending the relevance of home-grown 
produce beyond gardening households (Jehli ¯cka and Dan¯ek, 2017 ). 
Given the number of practitioners involved and the quantity of food 
produced, FSP is far from a niche practice: the patterns observed in our 
research are likely to shape the broader food system in the region. In that 
sense, our insights into the relation of FSP to other food sources present a 
crucial addition to existing research on this practice.
Our third argument relates the hierarchy of diverse food economies 
to their diverse temporalities. In advancing this idea, we draw on Philip 
McMichael ’s (2015) conflation of temporality and value. We show that 
the cyclic-qualitative time determined by gardening rhythms is associ -
ated with a higher value. As a consequence, it structures the gardeners ’ 
practices in the other two – market and alternative market – segments of 
diverse food economies. The participants in our research were not 
striving for self-sufficiency for the sake of being independent from the 
market or the industrial food system. Instead, their ambition was to 
provide their households with good-quality food. As a result, they still 
shopped for part of their fruits and vegetables in supermarkets, partic -
ularly in seasons when food from the preferred sources was unavailable. At the same time, they applied multiple strategies to minimise their 
reliance on conventional markets, which they associated with lower 
food quality. The seasonal patterns we discovered in respondents ’ food 
sources and diets are particularly remarkable considering that diverse 
types of fruits and vegetables were available (and affordable) to them 
throughout the year. Despite that, their fruit and vegetable consump -
tion16was crucially shaped by the ‘garden time ’ of non-market food 
sources.
Existing research points to a congruence between economic relations 
and temporal ontologies (Vincent and Feola, 2020 ): the accelerated and 
linear ‘market time ’ pertaining to the capitalist agro-industry contrasts 
with the slower and cyclical ‘garden time ’ of non-market food econo -
mies. Confirming this, our case challenges the often presumed relations 
of dominance on both levels: it contests the assumption about FSP being 
replaced by market-based food provision, and with that also the 
discourse of ‘market time ’ overruling ‘garden time ’. We thus confirm the 
relevance of temporality for deepening the analysis of economic di-
versity, and we highlight the role of seasonality as an important point of 
attention for research on diverse food economies and their mutual 
interactions.
7.Conclusion
Current debates on food and agriculture often leave the reader with a 
rather bleak impression: the ever-accelerating pace of global capitalism 
leaves little time for the natural rhythms of food production, and more 
sustainable futures are only imaginable through out-of-the-box in-
novations. In the spirit of Gibson-Graham ’s (2008) reading for differ -
ence, this paper suggests the possibility of a different and more hopeful 
interpretation of food practices existing on the household level.

16We acknowledge here the diverse diets of our respondents, in which fruits 
and vegetables played more or less significant role. Our data does not allow us 
to generalise the importance of informal economies and seasonal rhythms for 
other types of food. Furthermore, our future research will compare the diets of 
gardening and non-gardening household to further comprehend the influence of 
FSP on eating patterns.L. Sovov ˘a and P. Jehli¯cka                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Geoforum  163 (2025)  104322

Our research questions the hegemony of the market-based food 
economy by showing that other ways of obtaining food are not only 
multiple and substantial but also favoured by their practitioners and 
influential in their food-related behaviours. While the seasonal patterns 
observed in this study confirm this, they also deliver another general 
point concerning the temporalities related to everyday food practices. 
The food provisioning practices of our respondents – who reside in an 
urban centre of an industrialised country and lead a relatively affluent 
lifestyle – are subject to the capitalist temporality of round-the-clock 
availability and on-the-go fast consumption. However, these forces do 
not seem more important than the cyclical temporality of the growing 
seasons. The findings presented in this paper thus add to the emerging 
body of literature that problematises the narrative of Euromodern linear 
time eclipsing ‘traditional ’, cyclical, and nature-related time.
This paper complements current literature on diverse food econo -
mies by examining traditional non-market economies. This opens new 
opportunities for exploring diverse interconnections and hierarchies 
among diverse food sources. It also allows us to contest the implicit but 
persistent tendency in the debates on alternative food practices to search 
for novel, emerging initiatives, thus locating their transformative po-
tential in the unidentified future. Instead, our findings highlight the 
relevance of a practice embedded in a long-term tradition, which has 
often been portrayed as outdated and in decline but which, however, 
presents a food alternative with contemporary relevance.
