More-than-transactional circular economies: the café-urban farm 
nexus and emergent regional food waste circuits

ABSTRACT  
As governments encourage circular economy (CE) initiatives, markets for 
waste recirculation are taking shape. But implementation is in its 
infancy and material circuits are emergent. Early food waste CEs shaped 
by commercial players emphasise capital investment, routinised forms 
of waged labour, processing sites distant from food waste sources, and 
transactional relationships. Less well understood is the potential for 
vernacular circularity beyond market-based, transactional frames. This 
paper reports from a collaborative research exercise with a non-profit 
community farm in nonmetropolitan Australia, seeking to connect with 
cafés to access food waste for composting. Cafés are a nexus of 
production and consumption, ubiquitous in the contemporary 
multicultural Australian context, and therefore ideal for grassroots CEs. 
Ten local cafes participated, reviewing existing food waste practices, 
motivations for circularity, and contextual factors including the regional 
setting. We found that food waste circularity emerges via divergent 
pathways related to enterprise type and scale, environmental values of 
actors, place embeddedness, and local relationships. These pathways 
reflect the place-based attributes and diverse sustainability values of 
residents and businesses in the coastal, industrial city of Wollongong, 
where the study is based. Contrasting distant, transactional circuits, are 
more-than-transactional food waste pathways, developed by microscale 
actors shaping vernacular material flows and “hacking” public provision 
of Food Organic and Garden Organic (FOGO) waste services to mobilise 
environmental values and community relationships. Overlooked by 
“big policy” more-than-transactional relationships bind producers, 
intermediaries and consumers in closer loops and, in so doing, enrich 
place and facilitate an ethic of care for soil and land.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Circular economy (CE) initiatives are among the more popular sustainability interventions promoted 
by governments, encompassing the divergence and reuse of material flows of production, consump -
tion, and waste away from landfill. The principle is nothing new: reusing, recycling and repurposing 
materials are long-standing features of human societies, and in much of the world, salvaging and 
reusing materials is a source of grassroots livelihoods and survival (Carenzo 2017 ). In the affluent 
Minority world, CE policy initiatives arise from heightened concerns over the economic and

environmental costs of waste and disposal, amidst unprecedented levels of production, consump -
tion and fluctuation in recycling capacities (NSW Government 2018 ). In this decisive phase, circular 
markets for materials are taking shape. Yet, progress has been varied – a function of the distinctive 
pathways and value-propositions inherent in “heterogeneous biophysical materials” (Bakker and 
Bridge 2006 ). Not all materials beget easy circularity (Stanes 2021 ). And thus, CEs take diverse 
forms, some maturing as capitalist markets, others lagging or splintering into incoherent forms 
(Lynch 2022 ). While reuse markets for post-consumer materials proliferate (Warren and Gibson 
2021 ), actually-existing circularity is rare (Hobson 2020 ). Indeed, circularity for its own sake is not 
uncomplicated, nor intrinsically virtuous. As with all markets, uneven power relations configure 
state, capitalist, and civil society actors, socially and spatially (Massey 1984 ). Diverse CEs thus have 
the potential to consolidate or distribute power, concentrate or share profits, and embed more or 
less exploitative relations among actors (Herod et al. 2014 ). Calls for acknowledgement of these 
justice considerations have accelerated as CEs are integrated into market-based paradigms 
(Ashton et al. 2022 ; Hobson 2016 ; Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ). How exactly CEs take shape, on- 
the-ground, in specific geographical contexts, is thus our concern in this article.
We accordingly report from a collaborative research project undertaken to document and explore 
possibilities for food waste CEs in a nonmetropolitan Australian setting. The collaboration was 
between university researchers and a non-profit urban farm, Green Connect, that is guided by per-
maculture and waste recovery principles and dedicated to training and career development for 
former refugees and unemployed young people. Green Connect is based in Wollongong, in the Ill-
awarra region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia (80 km south of Sydney). A successful food pro-
ducer, it encompasses an 11-acre urban farm and Fair Food enterprise, in a socio-economically 
disadvantaged neighbourhood on land leased from the NSW Department of Education. A steep, 
unused, weedy lot once used as a dumping ground, is now a functioning farm providing food, 
jobs and connection to people and community. One author of this paper has for the past 4 years 
been involved in growing food and repurposing food waste on peri/urban farms in the region, 
including at Green Connect. While Green Connect had been keen to improve food waste circularity 
and “close the loop” between food waste and food cultivation, perennial problems resurfaced. The 
goal – to develop “small loops” (Hobson 2020 ), linked to restaurants and cafes – required alignment 
between food waste recycling, agricultural rhythms, and the exigencies of kitchen work, consumer 
expectations and insufficient composting materials. The potential for cafés to redirect food waste 
back to Green Connect was discussed with the (then) manager of the urban farm. The hope was 
to evolve closer ties between food waste and food production, whilst creating efficiencies in existing 
farm infrastructure and leveraging local food box delivery routes. While the circularity of food in café 
and restaurant settings can include preventative actions or circulation of soon-to-expire foodstuff, 
this paper focuses exclusively on biowaste (consisting of food waste) recycling.
Considerations of materials and logistics immediately surfaced as that author, in dialogue with 
Green Connect, countenanced closed-loop models for food waste recirculation. Beyond technical 
considerations, it became clear that an understanding of social, cultural, and economic factors 
was necessary (Corvellec et al. 2020 ). Certain enterprises, and the settings of their work, lend them -
selves to distinctive forms of circularity. Cafés are one such enterprise, and cultural-economic space. 
Cafés have their own “vibe”, place-based character, and community connections. While some cafe 
markets are oligopolized (e.g. United States [Starbucks] and United Kingdom [Costa]), in Australia, 
New Zealand and much of Europe, cafes are mostly independently operated, family-owned, small 
enterprises. A culmination of diverse migrant and grassroots entrepreneurial experiences, cafés 
are distinctive ethnic small businesses that, especially in Australia, are ubiquitous (Felton 2018 ). 
They are frequently expressions of owners’ desires and passions. And like mushrooms, cafés pop 
up anywhere when the conditions are suitable. In an Australian regional setting such as Wollongong, 
they emerge beside libraries, at markets, in inner-city car parks or annexed to homes. Critically, cafés 
are points of intersection between consumption, production, and waste; sourcing produce that 
requires further processing (preparation, cooking and/or plating) before serving. Cafés are poised LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 
 751
to not only participate in circular food waste activities, but to introduce sustainable practices to the 
public through their position as “third places” where publics meet (Oldenburg 2013 ). Understanding 
the potential for Green Connect to close the food waste loop thus required two phases of research: 
first, to conduct qualitative research with café managers, owners and workers about their food waste 
experiences, values, and practices, and second, to propose a scenario for cafes to more fully “close 
the loop” with the Green Connect farm. We report on both phases of the research here.
We thus bring to the surface a key tension identified in the ensuing results and analysis: between 
emergent food waste circuits dominated by profit-seeking waste management firms (and based on 
socio-technical systems akin to other forms of materials recycling and waste management, in which 
monetary transactions define relationships) and more-than-transactional circuits encompassing 
informal and hybrid food waste practices that prioritise community relationships. We refer to 
these informal, community-centred circuits underpinned by social and environmental values 
beyond transactional concerns as “vernacular CEs”. Guided by post-capitalist and feminist principles 
to eschew profit- and rent-seeking (Cameron and Gibson-Graham 2003 ), we evaluate the potential 
for grassroots economic activities based on environmental and social values (cf. Hobson 2020 ). Our 
guiding research question was: what are the prospects for more-than-transactional food waste cir-
cuits in a prosaic regional setting? As we elaborate below, forging closer, vernacular CEs against the 
dominance of profit-seeking waste management firms requires attentiveness to a range of factors, 
including enterprise type and scale, personal environmental values of key intermediary actors, 
place embeddedness, and the presence and durability of meaningful local relationships.
Literature review
The globalised food system is shaped by industrialised capitalism and profit-based logics that drive 
over-production, global land and soil exploitation, and the externalisation of waste (Kneafsey et al. 
2021 ). The accumulation of wealth through food production depends on linear modes of consump -
tion enabled through the production of landfill to keep food waste “out of sight out of mind” (Evans, 
Campbell, and Murcott 2012 ). Circular economy (CE) challenges the linear character of mainstream 
economic growth via the revaluing and recirculation of post-purchase resources (Lekan, Jonas, and 
Deutz 2021 ). Emerging from the field of political ecology as a critique and solution to the waste gen -
erated in industrialised production in consumer societies (Hobson 2016 ), CE promotes the revaluing 
and recommodification of waste for input into new phases of production (Korhonen et al. 2018 ). 
Described as “restorative and regenerative industrial systems” (Hobson 2016 , 88) CE aims to 
“value resources by keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible” (NSW Government 
2019 , 2). It therefore aspires to a transition from the linear, resource-consuming economy, decou -
pling economic growth from resource wastage (Corona et al. 2019 ).
While much CE policy aspires to smoothly-functioning circulations of materials through well- 
ordered markets, CEs take divergent forms, and actually-existing circularity – where the waste pro-
ducts of one process tightly feed into production, consumption, and waste feedback loops – are rare 
(Hobson 2020 ). CEs range from industrialised models, currently prioritised in public policies, to social- 
enterprise models emphasising local development (Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ) and closing-the- 
loop at a smaller scale (Hobson 2020 ). Pathways to circularity vary, shaped by market players, geo -
graphical density and proximity, and the specific properties of materials. While some markets reuse 
of materials have proceeded apace (e.g. plastic/cardboard/metal waste repurposing), others have fal-
tered (Lynch 2022 ). Beyond technical considerations, the stuttering emergence of CEs compels 
analysis of how they take shape across a spectrum of possible social relations.
This article accordingly seeks to make sense of CE as a series of emergent economic forms. In the 
case of CE, government policy has, in an emergent phase, favoured market-based approaches, sup-
porting private sector innovation in the revaluing and extraction of financial value from post-pur -
chase commodities and previously wasted resources (Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ; Warren and 
Gibson 2021 ). CE is envisaged by governments as a market-based approach and understood as a 752 
 S. QUIRK ET AL.
technical problem to be overcome by engineers and supply chain experts (Bulkeley, Watson, and 
Hudson 2007 ). In NSW, Australia, where the authors are based, the government has promoted 
large-scale solutions, “standardised” approaches, sector-wide “benchmarks” and “industrial waste 
collection” (NSW Government 2020 ). The NSW Government mandate for food and organic waste 
recycling applies to households at the municipal scale and “targeted business” including “large 
supermarkets and hospitality businesses” (NSW DPIE 2021a ) – locking-in waste pathways to new 
technologies and distant processing centres including “new organics transfer stations to move 
material outside urban areas for processing” (NSW DPIE 2021a ). Yet, emergent market relations of 
this shape warrant scrutiny. Such approaches overlook the potential for localised nutrient capture 
and associated environmental, economic and social benefits (Lu, Qu, and El Hanandeh 2020 ; McClin -
tock 2010 ), while the large-scale focus reproduces an “out of sight out of mind” waste paradigm 
(Evans, Campbell, and Murcott 2012 ), limiting actual circularity and its transformative potential (cf. 
Hobson and Lynch 2016 ). While CE can be transformative, it has also been critiqued as a market 
instrument focusing on profit at the expense of “the political and socio-cultural dimensions that a 
transition to circularity would entail” (Corvellec et al. 2020 , 99). For those sceptical of the propensity 
of capitalist actors to address sustainability equitably, the challenge is to comprehend emergent CEs 
based on more-than-transactional and market-based paradigms.
Feminist political economists draw attention to the diverse enterprises, forms of work and 
relationships that sustain social and economic systems (Fraser 2014 , 542) including unpaid 
work in the home and nonprofit and volunteer organisations. Understanding the diversity of 
enterprises across and within industries is thus important for contemplating capitalism’s alterna -
tives (Gibson-Graham 2008 ). CE forms range from “high-tech”, global-corporate-conglomerates of 
manufacturing industries where aftermarkets are to be exploited, to hyper-localised solutions 
based less on transactions than on relationships and non-market values (social, cultural, and 
environmental). Hobson (2020 ) for example, foregrounds the everyday circular spaces and 
smaller-scale initiatives crucial to CE transitions (Hobson 2016 ). The “ordinary practices of 
sharing and circularity” (Holmes 2018 , 138) underpinning alternative systems demand different 
conceptual framings and methods.
Such possibilities are central to the question recently posed by Ashton et al. (2022 ) regarding 
who wins and who loses from CE. CE’s evolution in a market-based paradigm strives for formalisa -
tion, with discarded resources “drawn into the private sphere” (Ashton et al. 2022 , 4) and recom -
modification for profit. This can disempower on-the-ground actors practicing vernacular 
circularities (Chen and Carré 2020 ; Soliz Torres and Acosta 2017 ). Carenzo, Juarez, and Becerra 
(2022 ) acknowledge these dynamics in formalising recycling practices in Argentina, where Corpor -
ate Circular Business Models (CBMs) driven by top-down governance, individual appropriation of 
collective benefits and protectionism (with regards to IP) proliferate. Meanwhile, tensions grow 
between the capacities of more-than-transactional social enterprise to diversify economic develop -
ment towards CE while eschewing larger circuits of capital (Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ). “Grass -
roots” CBMs reframe waste as a commons underpinned by collective governance and sharing 
solutions that transcend “market and techno-productive” framings, while centring social and 
human dimensions (Carenzo, Juarez, and Becerra 2022 ). Yet many grassroots CBMs struggle for 
a seat at the table (Carenzo 2017 ). Understanding CE “from below” is therefore key to possibilities 
for more equitable CEs.
Café culture and vernacular circularity
For food waste especially, the spectrum of possible circularities is broader than solely profit-seeking 
market players, encompassing diverse actors operating at the edge of, or beyond, profit-seeking 
logics, including cafés and restaurants, domestic households, food industrial processing facilities, 
and charities. Here we focus on cafés. The café is, at one level, a capitalist enterprise selling beverages 
and food to consumers for profit. The tendrils of café consumption and production reach from local LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 
 753
food producers to the distanced global supply chains within which coffee – the cafe’s stock in trade – 
is entangled (Neilson and Pritchard 2009 ). Yet, cafes are more than merely firms in a capitalist 
marketplace. In contexts such as Australia, with few corporate owned chains, cafes have deep commu -
nity roots (through migrant heritage, and in vernacular high street culture). Cafés connect histories of 
colonialism, urbane culture, and political activism to agricultural commodity production and 
distribution. Said to have emerged first in Constantinople in the 1500s at the crux of maritime 
trading routes forged by colonial expansion, cafés spread across Europe in the Georgian and Victorian 
eras, trading upon coffee’s taste and addictive properties (as a stimulant drug), becoming important 
social spaces enabling the flourishing of radical political culture and artistic and literary communities 
(Tjora and Scambler 2013 ). Nowadays, cafés are high street and shopping mall spaces embedded in 
everyday life (Eom, Yoon, and An 2021 ) and in Australia especially, forge a distinctive vernacular 
public realm (Walters and Broom 2013 ). Italian and Greek post-war migrants brought with them the 
espresso machine, and were pioneers of Australian café culture (Felton 2018 ), from the inner city to 
small country towns (Alexakis and Janiszewksi 2016 ). Offering a “certain cachet” (Felton 2018 ), cafés 
were an important location to stay connected to community, particularly for migrants, cultivating 
everyday multiculturalism (cf. Noble 2013 , 182). Notwithstanding the racial discrimination that many 
café operators faced (Alexakis and Janiszewksi 2016 ), cafés have been places of social experimentation 
and innovation facilitating a greater acceptance of multiculturalism.
Cafés and restaurants have also been understood as businesses pioneering social enterprise and 
sustainable consumer behaviour (Higgins-Desbiolles, Moskwa, and Gifford 2014 ; Lewis and Vodeb 
2021 ), promoting environmental awareness and practices through the enjoyment of conversations 
and consumer experiences (Higgins-Desbiolles, Moskwa, and Gifford 2014 ; Loschelder et al. 2019 ). 
Matters of provenance, seasonality and local varieties and production can be foregrounded 
(Higgins-Desbiolles and Wijesinghe 2018 ) connecting broader food systems and local consumers 
(Lewis and Vodeb 2021 ). Through food waste repurposing, cafés have the potential to contribute 
to food waste cultures guided by more-than-transactional motivations, from sustainability to a 
more-than-human ethic of care for soil and land (Puig De La Bellacasa 2015 ). Whether such possibi -
lities materialise on-the-ground, and how, was the subject of our inquiry.
The study
Initial directions for the research were shaped by discussions with the (then) farm manager at local 
urban farm, Green Connect, seeking to connect with cafes in Wollongong to access food waste for 
composting. The ultimate aim of this collaboration was to develop a distinctive, more-than-transac -
tional CE via localised composting, linking a social enterprise prioritising community development 
with café managers’ growing concern about food waste processing. However, understanding the 
potential for Green Connect to close the food waste circuit required an initial phase of research 
(reported here): to conduct qualitative research with café managers, owners and workers about 
their food waste experiences, values, and practices.
Qualitative interviews probed how cafes positioned themselves in relation to food waste com -
posting opportunities afforded by the regional setting. In contrast to metropolitan cities, such as 
Sydney and Melbourne, the diversity and relative proximity of industrial landuse zones to residential 
populations, means that regional towns are at the forefront of emergent food waste CEs (Ames and 
Cook 2020 ; Wall 2020 ). These diverse landuse zones and locational features matter to emergent food 
circularities: they create the optimal conditions through which to channel public investment in 
industrial food waste infrastructures into the region, including via NSW Government Infrastructure 
Grants (NSW DPIE 2021b ). These grants have particularly supported the transition of local soil 
company (Soilco) to industrialised organics composting. The nonmetropolitan setting therefore 
comprises both café cultures and organics composting facilities generating diverse values, relation -
ships and interactions between small, community-based businesses, industrial scale and vernacular 
food waste circularities.754

Methods
The primary method of data collection was semi-structured qualitative interviews with café workers, 
managers, and owners in Wollongong. Originally, interviews on site were to be combined with a tour 
of kitchen facilities, and explanations of how food waste was managed in cafe spaces. This would 
investigate the socio-material dynamics of cafés that are under-reported in the literature (cf. Fine 
1990 ). Because of the COVID-19 (Delta variant) outbreak in Sydney from June to October 2021, work -
place tours could not be conducted. Interviews were instead via Zoom meetings, limiting in situ 
insights on materials, but nevertheless intensifying the focus on the values of the participating 
workers regarding food, waste, sustainability, and the community.
Ensuing recruitment was targeted rather than randomised. After formalising their support, Green 
Connect provided consent to incorporate their delivery routes to narrow down the number of poten -
tial participating cafes. Although some cafés remained open during the Delta-variant lockdown, 
many closed. For others, staff were shed, leaving a skeleton workforce. Because of staff losses, man -
agers and owners were time-poor, resulting in recruitment delays. While the sample size was there -
fore smaller than anticipated, the ten cafés interviewed generated rich insights into café waste 
processes, generating over 50,000 transcribed words.
In line with University Research policies, the project sought and received ethics approval (HREC: 
2021/142). Café participants were informed that results would be reported back to Green Connect to 
inform new potential food waste circuits; for this, all gave their consent. Three participating cafe 
managers chose to be assigned a pseudonym and one participant chose to be referred to by 
their position. In what follows, five cafés have been given alternate names. Some enterprises gave 
consent to be named but on further advice have been anonymised, given that participants revealed 
aspects of their food waste practices that could be considered as transgressing regulations for 
municipal waste schemes (e.g. using a service they are not paying for or not paying for at a business 
rate).
The interview schedule comprised three main sections. The first section sought to identify what 
cafés do with food waste, in particular whether cafés sent food waste to landfill or pursued alterna -
tive options. This section also encouraged participants to reflect on the place-based material infra -
structures (bins, collection mechanisms) and workplace and labour force dynamics in managing food 
waste flows. The second section interrogated motivations and values underpinning existing prac -
tices of food waste recycling. Here, participants were invited to reflect on values and motivations 
underpinning owning and operating the café and engagement with other local businesses and com -
munities (cf. Mostafanezhad and Suryanata 2018 ). A third section of the interview, examining future 
scenarios for urban-farm and café CEs, rounded out the discussion.
An introduction to participating cafes
Participating cafes reflected the diversity of contemporary Australia. Turnip Up café is in a central 
area that has long suffered neglect but remains popular with commuters using the railway 
station, along with healthcare workers from nearby Wollongong Hospital. Co-owner Ursula is 
proud of their Middle Eastern heritage and deep connection to food provenance. Glass Alley is 
located in Wollongong Central Mall, owned by Nathan, whose passion for coffee led him to 
abandon his corporate accounting career. The café’s focus is on speciality coffee but is complemen -
ted by restaurant-style take-away food, filling the niche of coffee and lunch for office workers – an 
echo of Nathan’s past. A hundred metres south, on Burelli Street, is Guts About Health Café, spilling 
onto the footpath from the side of a multistorey car park. Advertising organic produce and coffee, it 
is a café-cum-organic and wholefood retailer owned by Dorothy, who with a coaching background 
runs it with a wellbeing focus, facilitating diverse dietary needs.
Further south, tall office buildings transition to a lower-density mixed industrial area with mech -
anics, food manufacturers, and Bell and Spoke Café. Originating from a single coffee machine in a 
bike shop, Bell and Spoke has grown into a standalone establishment renowned with cyclists. LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 
 755
Tucked away behind trees and annexed to the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre (IPAC), is The Social, 
popular with employees of Wollongong City Council located across the road. A kilometre north, at a 
dramatic beachside location, is Diggies Café and The Kiosk, nestled under 150-year-old Norfolk Island 
pines and the city’s heritage-listed surf-bathing club. The beachside café, popular among tourists, 
exercisers, and beachgoers, has a youthful staff, many also students at the university. Further 
north is Delano Speciality Coffee, operating a roastery and wholesale coffee supply business from 
a warehouse in a bustling industrially zoned precinct of factories and small workshops. The remain -
ing three cafes are in small coastal suburbs further north: The Broken Drum, a small espresso bar run 
by Jo and Graeme after moving from Sydney with their young family; the Walnut Cafe, a popular 
community-minded establishment and local social hub; and Letterbox Latte, nestled alongside 
yoga studios, rapidly gentrifying houses and dog walkers in beachside Austinmer.
Existing food waste practices
While participating cafés differed in location, clientele, and focus, all but one had developed food 
waste recycling processes (Table 1). Larger cafés maintained relationships with commercial waste 
services providers that collected and transported food waste to an industrial-scale processing 
plant (Soilco) in nearby Kembla Grange, for composting and sale to landscaping companies through -
out NSW. The generally smaller cafés made use of what was available to them. Bell and Spoke, Letter -
box Latte and Walnut Café had access to the recently introduced Food Organics Garden Organics 
(FOGO) recycling scheme introduced by Wollongong Council for kerbside household collection 
(highlighted in green in Table 1), also processed at Soilco. This was possible because they were 
annexed to residential buildings. The latter two also have on-site compost bins. Glass Alley café 
had access to organics recycling, organised by their landlord. Dorothy, manager at Guts About 
Health, took food waste home and composted it. The Broken Drum and Walnut Cafés also had com -
munity members pick-up some organic waste. Meanwhile, Turnip Up had reached out to local com -
munity members to collect waste but was unsuccessful.
While cafés were already actively experimenting with food waste repurposing, the nature of cir-
cularity diverged. Focusing on the flow of organic waste from cafes to end users, Figure 1shows that 
cafes reliant upon Soilco as the processing location, (Delanos, Diggies, The Social and Glass Alley) 
including those cafes that via FOGO connected indirectly to Soilco (IE Bell and Spoke, Letterbox 
Latte and Walnut Café), contributed to a commercialised waste pathway. Here, food waste was reva -
lued through industrial-scale compost production as an additional aftermarket commodity in the 
agricultural and landscaping industries (cf. Warren and Gibson 2021 ). This commercial pathway 
was not a strictly circular, closed-loop organic food waste model. Nutrients from food waste were 
not processed locally, nor used to grow food in urban farms in the same localities.
Neither did cafés that processed organic waste on-site or via community members (Letterbox, 
Walnut, Broken Drum, Guts About Health) achieve strict circularity. This compost supported food 
production for community members but not food used by the café. At the same time, three of 
these cafes were also directing food waste to commercial pathways through the FOGO scheme, 
highlighting the integration of grassroots and commercial models (Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ). 
Café food waste circuits were therefore emergent – not completely fixed or locked-in. While emer -
gent practices succeeded in diverting food waste from landfill, none closed the loop completely, 
achieving circularity.
Three emergent food waste repurposing systems: corporate, hacking and DIY
Underpinning these different waste flows are divergent economic rationalities, consumer relation -
ships and labour processes. To capture the diversity of cafes’ adopted approaches, we categorised 
waste reuse pathways into three categories: the corporate solution; hacking solution; and DIY sol-
ution (summarised in Table 2).756 
 S. QUIRK ET AL.
The corporate solution was used by the four largest cafes: Delano Speciality Coffee; The Social; 
Diggies and The Glass Alley. Each was owned by, or in property relationships with larger 
business enterprises.1Under the corporate solution, cafés contracted a Waste Services Provider 
(WSP) (e.g. Remondis) or food waste processor, Soilco, who provided cafés with a bin (210– 
660 L wheelie bins) and collection service. Food waste processed at Soilco, used in-vessel com -
posting comprising fully automated enclosed tunnels that controlled water, air, and heat (Soilco 
2020 ). This high-tech, mechanised solution required codified knowledge of industrialised com -
posting in accordance with Australian standards, acquired by workers inside the enterprise, Table 1. Cafes’ food waste end of use practices.

rather than through formal external training. The finished product, sold commercially for large- 
scale landscaping, farming, and home gardening, was distributed beyond the locality, thus 
requiring further inputs. The corporate solution aligned with a transactional, profit-driven CE Table 2. Selected characteristics of food waste reuse pathways.

Figure 1. Flow of organic waste from cafes to end users. This includes: participating cafés (row 1); collection and waste proces -
sing entities (row 2); place of processing/end use (row 3); the compost distributor (row 4); and destination of industrially com -
posted food waste (row 5; dotted lines). In none of these solutions is the food waste being repurposed into compost that is 
known to grow food that is used in the café, demonstrating the difficulty of achieving complete circularity. Initial flows of

foregrounding recommodification of, and value extraction from, waste products (cf. Warren and 
Gibson 2021 ). A large resource base was consolidated while both café staff and consumers 
lacked awareness of the waste pathway and downstream processing methods, furthering an 
“out of sight out of mind” mentality.
The corporate solution was only financially viable when food waste volumes reached a critical mass. 
Food waste was the heaviest component of cafes’ general mixed waste attracting a waste levy for dis-
posal to landfill ($147.10/tonne in Wollongong [NSW EPA 2021 ]). Critical mass was reached when it was 
cheaper to remove food from general mixed waste and employ corporate composting. Smaller 
businesses were unable to reach the critical mass, but of the cafés adopting the corporate approach, 
Diggies – a large café with approximately 70 staff – reached the critical mass, saving $2000 per month 
through corporate composting. For Delano and The Social, the decision to use corporate waste provi -
ders was not strictly financial, but their scale and turnover (as part of larger companies) justified this in 
line with environment, social, and governance (ESG) values. Smaller cafés did not have the financial 
scope to make similar decisions. The exception was The Glass Alley Café, a small business, located 
in the Wollongong Mall where their tenancy included a food waste recycling service.
The hacking solution was used by Walnut, Letterbox Latte and Bell and Spoke cafes. These 
businesses did not generate enough waste to engage corporate WSPs, but due to their location in resi-
dential areas, they could access Wollongong City Council’s FOGO service, introduced in 2020 and also 
processed by Soilco. Designed for households rather than small businesses (and funded via housing 
rates), this approach could be considered a form of “hacking”, through the unauthorised access and 
adaptation of other infrastructure (see Maalsen 2022 ). The residential location of these cafes provided 
access to Council’s FOGO service connecting cafe kitchens to Soilco’s industrial composting. Lines were 
blurred between micro-enterprises and residential households.
DIY solutions were non-commercial waste pathways where café owners or community members 
recycled organic waste. These vernacular, non-transactional solutions included on-site composting, 
sharing of coffee grounds with local community members, and home composting. DIY and commu -
nity-based solutions were used by Guts About Health, The Broken Drum, Walnut Café, and Letterbox 
Latte (the latter two deploying the hacking alongside DIY and community-based solutions). Walnut 
Café and Letterbox Latte managed their compost on site, adding food scraps and organic materials 
(e.g. grass clippings). Dorothy, from Guts About Health, took food waste home, feeding static piles in 
her backyard to produce vermicast-type compost, used on her garden and offered to café customers 
for a donation (that was passed on to the farmers supplying the café). At the Broken Drum, food 
scraps were combined with general waste, where, like Walnut Café, coffee grounds were collected 
for school and community gardens for direct application on gardens or compost. These low- 
capital infrastructure solutions required tacit knowledge of composting, bringing people into 
closer engagement with food waste processing. The cafés undertaking such practices were 
smaller, generating less organic waste than those using corporate solutions. Pre-COVID-lockdown, 
Guts About Health generated just over 20L of food waste daily, equating to approximately 140L 
of food waste per week, compared to Diggies (five 660L FOGO bins weekly).
Smaller cafés achieved tighter circulation of food waste through backyards, preserving valuable 
nutrients in closer, local, intimate relationships. Deeper connections to waste were forged through 
being intimately involved with waste and understanding its more-than-commodity value (cf. Puig De 
La Bellacasa 2015 ). The hyper-local recirculation of nutrients was another outcome of such systems, 
with organic waste transformed into compost and used on-site to grow food or gardens or gifted for 
the same purpose.
Environmental and community values and food waste repurposing: more-than- 
transactional enterprises
The evolution of different solutions emerged from a melting pot of business goals, personal persua -
sion, and ambition. While participating cafés were mostly small businesses operating for profit in a LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 
 759
capitalist marketplace, participants held diverse environmental and community values, blurring 
boundaries between business and community interests (cf. Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ). It was 
impossible to divorce practices, including food waste practices, from the wider set of values that 
the cafés espoused, and managers held in relation to food provenance and localism.
Participants identified desires for a deeper connection to where and how food was grown. Emily, 
at Letterbox Latte, for instance, aimed not only to source supplies from local farmers in Kangaroo 
Valley (Fox and Quail), and urban farms (Green Connect and Popes Produce), but to orient the 
café menu around seasonal variation. As Emily explained: 
I created a flexible menu, based around what they have planted … a lot of brassica vegetables and greens, and 
trying to source grains and local bread. And then each week, or each day sometimes, it changes. For example, 
the farm down in Kangaroo Valley will message and be like “Hey, the Cauliflower has just bolted, do you want it 
for cheap?”. So, this week we’re doing a cheesy Cauliflower bake with Jalapeño jam. We get second Jalapeños 
that have gone a bit gross down at the farm and make them into jam. That’s how the menu runs.
For Emily, personal desire compelled her to reach out to the people that grew and harvested food: 
Growing up, I didn’t really have a strong connection with where my food was grown. So, throughout the last few 
years I have wanted to be working within a job that connects people closer to the produce that is being grown 
locally and where it is coming from. I don’t know, it’s like a really personal connection with them.
Local and organic food suppliers were similarly important for Ursula at Turnip Up, who grew up 
on an organic herb farm, where her Lebanese mother cultivated more than four hundred herb var-
ieties on a well-known property visited by chefs and naturopaths from across Australia. Revealing the 
alternative food cultures within Australia’s diverse migratory histories (Head et al. 2021 ), Ursula drew 
on her experience of organic farming to source food from small organic growers rather than larger 
farms dependent on chemical inputs.
For Dorothy, the redirection of food waste from landfill to her own backyard compost was the 
“whole intention” of the café, described as “the actual full cycle experience”. This included under -
standing where and how food was sourced: “not only to know where the food is coming from 
but what’s happening to the animal while it’s alive, [and] how it is killed”.
Meanwhile, at The Broken Drum, Graeme and Jo connected environmental values to social justice 
in global supply chains. Articulating values of “caring about the planet”, they sold keep-cups,2
sourced local suppliers to minimise “food miles”, and sought fair-trade coffee through suppliers 
(e.g. Campos), with a superior record on ethical fair trade, and upstream transparency. Graeme 
articulated a more-than-transactional philosophy towards relationships with suppliers: “I don’t 
think we would be able to handle going with a company that is just dealing with machinery or 
just treating people like machinery”.
Cafés also articulated desires to “keep it local”. For Sophie at Diggies, it was important to help 
support locals through tough times – pertinent during bushfires in 2019 and then pandemic con-
ditions (2020/21), through acknowledging producers: 
It has just been something on our menu that, rather than having just eggs, it’s Kangaroo Valley Eggs. It’s a small 
family run business and they got really badly affected during the bushfires, so it was really important for us to 
make sure they felt supported.
Others like Jo and Graeme of the Broken Drum supported local people by sourcing jams and cakes 
from their community, because “you just want to keep it as local as you can and invest in your own 
economy and your own little space”. They also supported local charities by hosting coffee tasting 
fundraiser events.
Motivations for cultivating local relationships were not only altruistic: they helped to generate 
reputational benefits – a form of cultural capital (cf. Bourdieu 1984 ) – as well as social capital. 
Emily at Letterbox Latte developed a relationship whereby her local food supplier made contact if 
some vegetables had bolted or were damaged and could be moved at a lower price. Brad’s relation -
ship with Hasties Meats, a local butchery, helped build trust to ensure transparency in the 760

provenance of meat. Similarly, the manager at Walnut Café sourced food from a local market 
because the relationship built over time meant they would “look after her” and distribute 
produce quickly. Walnut Café’s coffee grounds were collected by the local school, providing the 
café with a waste solution and the school with a beneficial soil amendment, recirculating nutrients 
locally and growing food for the community. At Delano café, the introduction of compostable coffee 
cups signalled a level of environmental “care” that ultimately attracted “more customers, and more 
money into the business”. Cafés’ experimentation with sustainable and localised food practices was 
therefore generative of cultural capital that enhanced business and client relationships.
These accounts reveal how the desire to connect with food producers and to nurture localised 
food initiatives (Mostafanezhad and Suryanata 2018 ) produces diverse waste pathways that compli -
cate transactional models. Such desires actively contributed to a vernacular café culture in the Illa-
warra that prioritised localised producers, seasonal menus, and ethical fair trade. The café became an 
intermediary space, developing and nurturing circuits of value (Lekan, Jonas, and Deutz 2021 ) 
between consumer culture and sustainability values (Higgins-Desbiolles, Moskwa, and Gifford 
2014 ), and through which diverse food waste circuits emerged.
Scenario for cafes to more fully “close the loop” with an urban farm
A scenario whereby a version of these diverse food waste circuits could be implemented was put to the 
cafes, in which Green Connect could collect the food waste generated at the cafes (via 20L buckets) 
and compost it on the farm. Generally, all cafes were interested in the potential of this closer loop. 
However, Turnip Up café, that generated too little waste for the industrial solution but couldn’t 
access the DIY or hacking solutions due to their location and clientele were the most excited about 
the cafe-farm solution. . Other cafes who already had solutions to their food waste recycling still 
expressed interest due to the cultural capital that Green Connect held, mentioning the reputational 
benefits that “sticking a Green Connect sticker” on their café windows and notice boards could add 
to their reputation. Cafes were also vocal about the limitations of this scenario as a solution, citing 
reasons such as space, collection frequency, smell and bin configurations. Despite these concerns, 
there was strong interest in linking the service of waste collection proposed with the addition of 
the farm supplying the café with food. Multiple cafes mentioned that they thought this more-than- 
waste-service-provider relationship would have reputational benefits for the café but would also 
make staff more connected to the food they were using and potentially less likely to waste it.
At the time of the study, this scenario and the linking of waste services and produce provision was 
unable to be implemented due to space and infrastructural limitations. Supplying cafes with a diver -
sity of produce every week would require a much larger output from Green Connect than the farm 
could achieve, or from the cafes’ perspective, a significant reduction in menu options. Despite this, in 
the intervening years, Green Connect has continued to expand their vegetable production and has 
plans to extend their composting facilities and practices on site. As with other Australian examples 
such as Loop Growers in Brisbane (https://loopgrowers.com/ ), these modifications enhance the 
potential for café-farm circularities pointing to nascent business models centring environmental 
and local values in food systems innovation.
Conclusion: cafes as intermediary spaces of sustainability
The emergent, heterogenous nature of food waste circuits is a reminder that economic forms are made, 
not given (Cameron and Gibson-Graham 2003 ; Polanyi 2001 ), shaped by cultural, economic and political 
contexts that differ by and evolve in place. Circular economies are still emerging in the Australian 
context, and are unlikely to cohere as a singular model, whether industrial, corporate, or more-than- 
transactional. Market players are asserting dominance, facilitating modest environmental improvements 
while circumventing more radical shifts (Ames and Cook 2020 ). Most government policy initiatives 
reflect this, framing transformation as a technology-centred, corporatized process, with a focus on LOCAL ENVIRONMENT 
 761
scaling-up (Hobson 2016 ; Lacy and Rutqvist 2016 ). The focus on large-scale projects fails to support 
relationships between food production and retailing in ways that forge “closer loops” with food produ -
cers and enhance prospects for initiatives to embrace a more-than-human ethic of care (Puig De La Bel-
lacasa 2015 ). The focus on economies of scale means that initiatives among smaller, economically 
diverse businesses may not fit the “growth paradigm” (D’Amato et al. 2017 , 725) leaving the capacities 
of smaller producers and retailers – the key focus of this research – unrecognised and realised.
Large investments made by governments and corporate actors have shaped emerging markets 
around food waste. Currently, food waste recycling in this corporate form is expensive for microbu -
sinesses such as cafes. They either must generate large amounts of food waste or must have a diver -
sity of revenue streams to be able to afford corporate food waste services. Nevertheless, the 
development of public kerbside food waste recycling in a regional setting has meant certain cafés 
could “hack” appropriate services (such as FOGO), in creative ways beyond their original intent.
This research showed that established corporate actors active in the food waste repurposing 
space use pre-existing relationships with WSPs to administer a largely status quo solution, augment -
ing but not challenging existing systems for other streams of waste such as co-mingled recycling. As 
governments seek to scale-up CE initiatives (FIAL 2020 ; NSW Government 2018 ), policy and funding 
may be available for corporate actors to further build markets. If true, there could in time be less, 
rather than more space for diversity of CE forms, as corporate actors lock into place infrastructural 
arrangements over long time-frames that may inhibit flexibility and transparency.
Nevertheless, other possibilities exist, and should factor more prominently in CE policy debates, for 
their ethical, environmental, and social advantages. Based on our study of cafe food waste in Wollon -
gong, we argue that vernacular, more-than-transactional variants must be promoted in shifting 
current production-consumption waste practices (Hobson 2016 , 2020 ; Hobson and Lynch 2016 ). Enter -
prises such as cafes lend themselves to the evolution of more-than-transactional forms of circularity 
because of their small scale, place embeddedness, and personal environmental and community 
values. Cafés lie at the centre of emerging food waste economies, assembling and accessing different 
food waste processing resources, relationships, and outcomes. These economies are embedded in 
the coastal, industrial city of Wollongong, where café cultures, sustainability values and food waste pro-
cessing facilities intermingle. Examining CE “from below” (Carenzo, Juarez, and Becerra 2022 ), illuminates 
a diversity of business types, foregrounding circuits of value associated with food provenance and loc-
alism. Such values underpinned the initiation of sustainable practices, and food waste repurposing is 
part of that repertoire. While political narratives in settler-colonial societies foreground sites of pro-
duction (such as farming and manufacturing) in sustainable transitions, intermediary spaces such as 
cafés potentially perform an important role in reinforcing and experimenting with sustainability practices 
and transitions. Considering the socio-material and place-based formation of CEs thus requires an 
approach focused on the contingent and spatially specific nature of systematic changes.
Possibilities abound to close the loop even further: to be more attuned to the sociomaterialities of loca -
lised farm composting: of sorting waste; integrating separate bins into waste streams; and adjusting waste 
contracts and pick-up times to align with farm compost processing (Quirk 2021 ). Grassroots CEs counte -
nance the potential for food waste partnerships that return food as waste to the soil via organic food pro-
duction, with minimal inputs or additional intermediaries. Cafes thus saw the reputational benefits of 
sourcing produce and food waste processing from the same local farm, aligning the café-farm nexus 
with the cultivation of cultural capital among an environmentally minded clientele. The ongoing docu -
mentation of CE experiments among diverse, smaller actors is therefore a crucial ingredient in the devel -
opment of the transformative CEs needed for more socially and environmentally just transitions.
