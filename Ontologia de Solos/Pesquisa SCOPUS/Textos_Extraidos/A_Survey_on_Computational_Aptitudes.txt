Abstract — Precision agriculture is a modern agriculture 
implementation technique in which analysis of numerous 
source data takes place for decision-making and operation in 
the management of crop production. The data for precision 
agriculture are collected through robots, sensors, satellites, and  
drones. The two approaches of precision agriculture are the 
predictive approach which is used for representing the static 
indicator during the crop cycle whereas the control approach is 
an updating of information Ontology is a demonstration of 
concepts and their shared association. It can be used in a wid e 
range of contexts, including the classification of agricultural 
information and the development of knowledge bases. The 
basic steps involved in precision farming are assessing 
variation, managing variability, and evaluation. The various 
tools used in precision farming are the internet of things (IoT), 
a global positioning system (GPS), geographic information 
system (GPS), remote sensor, proximate sensor technology, 
grid sampling, etc. With the increase in information technology 
in the field of agriculture. Consequently, data mining become 
much essential for decision-making. This paper attempts to 
emphasize the coherence of data mining approaches toward 
helping precision agriculture as a valuable venture.  
 
Keywords — Precision agriculture, Data mining, Ontology,

I. INTRODUCTIO N  
Precision agriculture is the application of modern 
techniques for the analysis of data for decision-making and 
crop management. The different new technologies used in 
precision agriculture are automated steering systems, Geo-
mapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning system, and 
variable rate technology. Ultimately precision agriculture 
aims to introduce automation in the field of agriculture. 
However, these technologies are not much used by farmers 
as there is not much awareness about the technologies. In 
some cases, these technologies are cost too high which 
farmers are not able to afford. There is a need for farmers to 
get updated with technology. Despite all these issues, the 
farmers must get updated with the latest technologies which 
will make ease the agricultural process. Growth in the 
computation approach has paved a way for the introduction 
of data mining principles. Hence, this paper will help in 
finding the advantages and disadvantages in the right 
direction to improve the agriculture process.  
II. PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND DATA MINING APPROACH  
In general precision agriculture helps in improving crop 
productivity with the help of information technology. Many approaches are discussed in the following section for 
improving the crop yield of precision agriculture. Some of 
the approaches that have developed in recent times are 
highlighted .  
 
A.  Vandana B[1] et al(2018) developed a novel strategy 
with big data analytics to increase crop productivity. The 
information is gathered from a real-time setting. Data 
analyses employ classification and prediction techniques. As 
a result, big data analytics is used to implement an efficient 
decision-making system for increased crop productivity. 
 
B. A  modular approach for crop health examination, and 
recognition of weeds, and insects was proposed by Akhil 
Kumar donka[3] et. al(2020). The input data are collected 
through an unmanned aerial vehicle. TensorFlow is used to 
construct a deep learning model for weed and insect 
detection. Finally, a prediction accuracy of 89.5% is 
attained .  
 
C. A computer vision approach for evaluating red beet plant 
count was proposed by A. Hassanzadeh[2] et al. (2021). 
Input data is collected through a multispectral sensor which 
is mounted on a DJI matrices 600 pro. Vegetation detection, 
feature generation, and feature selection are part of 
preprocessing . The plant count could be predicted using 
partial least square regression, which showed promising 
results.  
 
D. In order to anticipate rainfall, J. S. A. N. W. 
Premachandra[4] et al. (2021) have suggested a machine 
learning-based method. The input dataset is collected from 
the metrological department of the central environmental 
authority. The collected dataset is preprocessed for data 
consolidation, data reduction, data cleaning, and data 
discretization which the same has been fed into four 
machine learning algorithms such as Multiple Linear 
Regression, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, 
and Random Forest. As a result, it is observed that random 
forest has a high accuracy of 89.16% .  
 
E. EL HACHIMI Chouaib[5] et. al(2021) have proposed a 
machine learning approach for crop suggestion and weather 
estimation. Input data is segregated from an online dataset 
which consists of 2200 instances. Machine learning models 
like K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, Naïve 
Bayes, and logistic regression are used for performance Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC 2022)

precision, accuracy, and recall.  
III. PRECISION AGRICULTURE  DATA AND DATA ACQUIS ITION 
METHOD  
Precision a griculture is an approach used for getting high 
yields than the traditional technique. Data plays a main role 
in precision agriculture. The various  tools used to collect 
data in  precision agriculture are sensors, the Internet of 
Things, variable rate techn ology, automated steering 
systems,  global positioning systems,  and geographic 
information systems.  Each of the above  tools processes a 
variety of  data such as  crop yields,  weeds, soil types,  
weather conditions, different harvesting  operations, soil 
moistur e content, and  amount of fertilizer used . The 
different data acquisition is shown in fig 1.  The following

IV. USING DATA MINING FOR AGRICULTURE DATA 
PROCESSING  
Different data processing methods that are used in 
precision agriculture  in data mining are highlighted in this 
section.  
 
A. A study has been conducted by Kristoffer O. Flores[19] et. 
al(2016) to observe the agriculture field. The input data are 
collected through low -cost sensors such as  humidity, 
temperature, moisture, lumin osity, electrical conductivity, 
and pH are used. All sensors are linked  to a single Arduino 
microcontroller board with an Xbee shield for wireless 
communication. The sensor node is divided into three parts 
(i)sensor, (ii)microcontroller, (iii)RF transmitte r. Fin ally, 
each sensor collects the data at the  base station. The main 
server displays the data in a visualized form to a farmer 
about the status of the environment through a 
GUI(Graphical user interface) and soil condition which in 
turn helps for better productivity.

B. A study has been conducted by E.Murali[20] et. al(2018) 
to emphasize the data mining approaches for precision 
agriculture. The data are collected through variable rate 
technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, global positioning 
system, mapp ing technology, and guidance technology. 
Different data mining algorithms are studied which helps the 
farmers for an effective decision model. Finally, the study 
highlighted soil database maintenance, pest control, rainfall 
prediction, and crop recommendat ion.  
 
C. Grigore Stamatescu[21] et. al (2019)  proposed a data 
analysis and processing approach to crop and soil 
monitoring  for precision agriculture . The system 
architecture consists of a field layer, fog computing layer, 
cloud computing layer, and data p resentation layer. The data 
are collected through sensors. To compute the performance 
evaluation methods like the common linear interpolant and 
two closely related interpolants, cubic spline and shape -
preserving Piecewise Cubic He rmite Interpolating 
Polyno mial are used. Finally,  an extensive assessment of 
online decision -making by domain experts is obtained.  
 
D. A prototype IoT -based smart farming for soil moisture 
monitoring and analysis has been proposed by Supachai 
Puengsungwan[22] et. al(2020). The IoT  device  consists of 
cloud technology, user interface, and data analytics. The 
input data are real -time data. The data are fed into 
MATLAB for evaluation. As a result, soil moisture analysis 
and monitoring have been implemented using real -time data.  
 
E. A data processing for sentinel -1 SAR data and crop type 
classification with visualization has been proposed by Jacob 
Høxbroe Jeppesen[23] et. al(2020). The input data are 
collected from sentinel -1A and sentinel -1B satellites. Data 
visualization  is done for t hree different crop type s such as 
forestry, maize, and rapeseed are discussed. Six machine 
learning classifiers, including decision tree, random forest, 
logistic regression, linear SVM, RBF SVM, and neural 
network classifiers, are used to evaluate the data . Finally, 
RBF SVM performs better concerning individual crops with 
an overall accuracy of 94.02%.  
 
F. To determine the stage of a cotton leaf, Zekai Feng[24] et 
al. (2021) suggested an object detection technique based on 
a faster RCNN. The data used as in put are taken from a 
public dataset. The convolutional layer, pooling layer, 
activation layer, fully connected layer, and output layer 
make up the system architecture. The convolutional neural 
network, candidate layer extraction, and detecting object 
ident ification make up the algorithm. Finally, 80% of the 
cotton leaf stage can be recognized by the system.  
V. ONTOLOGY -BASED KNOWLEDGE MINI NG MODEL FOR 
PRECISION AGRICULTUR E 
Ontology -based Knowledge mining model for precision 
agriculture that provides a recommen dation system, soil 
mineral classification s, ontology -based prototype model, 
and plant domain knowledge model are highlighted in this 
section.  
 
A. FAN Jing[25] et al(2008)  suggested an ontology -based 
plant domain knowledge model . Plant knowledge and envir onment knowledge were separated from the plant 
domain knowledge ontology. Finally, an effective approach 
to knowledge modeling that makes use of ontologies was 
shown.  
B. A farmer helping system was proposed by 
Shyamaladevi[26] et. al(2012) which integrates  web services 
such as  soil information, crop disease information, plant 
information, pesticides, and fungicides information. The 
input data is semantically annotated data collected by the  
sensor. The architecture consists of sensor ontology to form 
a syste m ontology for knowledge representation. For 
determining which soil is better for crop planting and 
describing the pesticides and fungicides of a specific 
disease, a rule -based engine is developed. As a result, 
application enterprises and communities share  and reuse 
data.  
 
 C. Ontology -based knowledge management framework was 
proposed by Patrizia Ribino[27] et. al(2009). Two ontology 
domain model is represented which is based on structure 
and modeling the concept of project development. Finally, 
the Knowled ge management system prototype makes a rule -
based system that can adapt its result to the possible change 
in system ontology and document management system to 
improve document searching, sharing, and discovery.  
 
D.  A knowledge management approach for e -agriculture 
has been proposed by Muhammad Ahsan[28] et. al(2014). 
The data are collected through interviews, questionnaires, 
observations, expert advice, observed data, image 
documents, and reports. A prototype model is built to 
demonstrate the result. As a  result, ontology -based 
knowledge management has more  benefits than traditional 
knowledge management techniques.  
 
E. Ontology -based data access and integration for farming 
in Nepal are proposed by Suresh Pokharel[29] et. al(2014). 
The input data are ag riculture production statistics , weather 
information, crop growing days inf ormation, soil 
information , and administration data of Nepal. An ontology -
based vocabulary is created from the dataset to integrate 
data. As a result, AgriNepaldata is linked to an add itional 
dataset that provides one structured dataset for agricultural 
information.  
 
F.  An ontology -based knowledge management system for 
soil mineral classification and crop recommendation has 
been proposed by E. Murali[30] et al. (2021). An online 
databa se is used to gather the input data. The framework 
comprises knowledge gathering and validation, the 
development of an agricultural knowledge model, the design 
of agricultural rules, and knowledge visualization. A 
mechanis m for recommending crops has final ly been 
created.  
G. E.Murali[31] et. al(2021) have proposed multiple 
ontology -based knowledge mining models for agriculture. 
The framework consists of different ontologies like soil, 
crop, location, and season ontology. Soil ontology provides  
soil type as output, crop ontology provides crop type as 
output, location ontology provides a different location in Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC 2022)

which crop can be grown, and season ontology provides 
season in which crop can be grown. As a result, a multiple

VI. CONCLUSION  
This study highlighted the different data mining 
approaches, data processing, data acquisition, and ontology -
based knowledge man agement model discussed. It is 
observed study focuses on pest management, rainfall 
prediction, crop recommendation, crop, and field monitoring 
system, soil moisture detection, and crop health monitoring. 
Technology integration with agriculture help in the success 
of precision agriculture with the possibility of extending the 
technology of further computerization . Existing research has 
focused solely on a single type of vegetation, which is 
considered a limitation.  As a future scope, multiple 
vegetation can be focused on.
