Abstract
This paper utilizes Liliana Doganova’s book (Discounting the future: The ascen -
dancy of a political technology, 2024, Zone Books) to explore the provocations 
science and technology studies scholars have generated by engaging with 
futures politics. This includes politics of inclusion and exclusion, value compo -
sition, embodied constraints and efforts to challenge taken-for-granted future 
pathways. These politics and their extensions are then considered through Doga -
nova’s work. The paper concludes with an exploration of the conflicting political 
and temporal domains of valuation built into discounted cash flow formulas.
Keywords: futures; discounting; politics; time; science and technology studies.

Introduction
In this paper, I use the occasion of the publication of Liliana Doganova’s book – 
Discounting the future: The ascendancy of a political technology (Zone Books, 
2024 ) – as an opportunity to reconsider various streams of work which can 
trace their roots back to science and technology studies (STS) and have 
engaged in one way or another with futures. Developing over the last 20 
years, much of this futures work has an economic and, more specifically, 
market-based focus. Hence, we find studies of (amongst other things): new 
technology innovations, prototypes and demonstrations (Akrich, 1992 ; 
Collins, 1988 ; Suchman et al., 2002 ); futures trading and financial futures 
(MacKenzie, 2022 ; Maurer, 2002 ); and futures methods, prospecting and 
expectations (Brown & Michael, 2003 ; Pollock & Williams, 2010 ; Wilkie & 
Michael, 2009 ). The paper begins with a consideration of STS futures work 
and its attendant politics. I then engage in more depth with Doganova’s book 
to consider the ways futures politics characteristic of previous STS research 
are extended. I conclude with a consideration of future directions.
STS futures
STS work on futures to which Doganova’s Discounting the future contributes, can 
be organized into four broad themes, each suggesting their own combination of 
politics and the economic. First, the future of technology itself is central to the 
whole STS project – at least since science studies as a field was augmented by the 
‘turn to technology’ (Woolgar, 1991 ). A strong commitment has been maintained 
to counter an over-simplified form of determinism (for a discussion, see MacK -
enzie & Wajcman, 1999 ), through which the future effects of a technology can 
simply be ‘read-off’ from the material form. Although somewhat sloganistic, 
the mantra that ‘things could be otherwise’ retains a strong presence in STS 
scholars’ work (see for example Mol, 2024 ), providing a methodological impera -
tive that underpins much work in the field: if things could be otherwise, how can 
one account for the way things seem to be?
The default option for addressing this question has been detailed and up- 
close empirical studies of the specificities of a variety of technologies and 
their associated humans. Initially, this might seem to challenge the possibility 
of studying things that are yet to be. Instead, field-sites where the future is 
brought into being in the present have been prominent. For example, work 
in this vein has produced studies of the future of a broad number of 
domains, from education (Dix, 2019 ), to genes (Horst, 2005 ), to soil futures 
(de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). The STS inflection in this work has involved a long- 
standing focus on the sociomaterial features of the future in question, alongside 
a sceptical orientation toward how that future is or might be accomplished. 
Woolgar’s (1985 ) initial consideration of the move by science studies scholars 
to engage with technology was focused on artificial intelligence (AI) futures 746 Economy and Society
and their marketing. His suggestion was that the rhetoric of progress toward a 
positive AI future required ‘continual definition and redefinition’ (Woolgar, 
1985 , p. 565) of central concepts like intelligence, expertise, problems and sol-
utions to maintain the research enterprise.1‘The promise of future achievement 
hinges on the flexibility which makes redefinition possible’ (Woolgar, 1985 , 
p. 565). These early STS discussions of technology open up a specific kind 
of politics around redefinition. Early STS work suggest this politics of redefi -
nition needs to include STS itself and what is permitted or omitted, included or 
excluded, from the argumentative structure of the account of technology put 
forward by scholars (for reflections on this, see Woolgar & Cooper, 1999 ). 
One could say that this politics of definition, inclusion and exclusion has 
since been a continual feature of STS accounts of technology and their futures.
Alongside the future of technology, a second focus for STS work has been 
the future as topic/resource. Here the techniques through which futures are 
generated have been subject to scrutiny. Hence, prototyping as a sociomaterial 
mediator of different times and work orientations (Suchman et al., 2002 ), for 
example, has helped push along workplace studies. In much the same way, 
work on promissory organizations (Pollock & Williams, 2010 ), and the soci-
ology of expectations (Brown & Michael, 2003 ; Wilkie & Michael, 2009 ), 
have generated their own prominence and been central in further STS 
work.2The entanglement of studies of future-oriented practices in various 
forms and the future development of STS is witnessable in Akrich’s (1992 ) 
research into innovation (also with Callon and Latour [Akrich et al., 2002a , 
2002b parts I and II]) that played a significant part in the development of 
actor-network theory.
A different set of techniques has been the focus of related STS inspired 
studies of financial futures. MacKenzie’s (2022 ) work on futures trading on 
Chicago’s futures exchanges, for example, looks at the changing value and 
values built into ‘spoofing’.3Maurer’s (2002 ) earlier work engaged with cri-
tiques of derivatives that argued that these financial forms create unreliable 
future anticipations of value. These critiques, Maurer (2002 ) suggested, rely 
on the idea that derivatives lack referentiality – a clear reference to which 
they can point toward in establishing their value. Maurer (2002 ) held that prac-
tices of referentiality establish the terms on which things exist; referentiality 
brings things into being. In this way, questions of accuracy miss the mark 
and such critiques of derivatives as unreliable future projections can only be 
sustained by overlooking the techniques that bring derivatives into being. 
These techniques require study to make sense of the specific futures that 
derivatives accomplish. Alongside the politics of definition, inclusion and 
exclusion foregrounded by the first theme of work, by studying the specific 
practices of future making (from studies of expectations to work on financial 
futures), this second theme of work thus makes apparent, up close and in 
detail, the way future values are composed.
A third focus for STS work has been on histories of futures. For example, 
Asdal (2012 ) looks to early twentieth-century debates on animals for Daniel Neyland: Futures work 747
contemporary relevance, Cochoy and Soutjis (2020 ) explore archived pro-
motional material for anticipated price display technologies, Brown (2003 ) 
includes biopasts in a study of hyped futures, Delfonti and Frey (2021 ) and 
Jungnickel et al. (2024 ) both look to patents as a basis for oscillating between 
pasts and futures and Reichmann (2013 ) looks at the challenges of using past 
data to forecast economic futures. Taken together, a common motif running 
through these works is the way in which the relationship between past and 
future enables and constrains. Jungnickel (2023 ), for example, shows that by 
studying clothing patents, we can explore how futures posited by new clothing 
designs were articulated as a means to free women’s bodies and were also sim-
ultaneously involved in building new constraints. The mundane yet pervasive 
pocket, for example, and its absence in some garments, provides a means to 
illustrate a kind of politics through which the history of future embodied con-
straints is made visible.
Fourth, methods for generating or shaping (alternative or even better) 
futures have provided an albeit significantly varied focal point for STS work. 
Miller (2023 ) for example, takes on design futures. From a starting point 
that sociotechnical systems could be otherwise, Miller (2023 ) asserts that: 
‘It’s one thing to be good at making technology. It’s a very different thing to 
be good at designing, building, generating, maintaining, repairing and inhab -
iting technological societies’ (p. 187). It follows that STS might play a part 
in designing or experimenting with different futures, giving rise to the emer -
gence of a number of new institutes in the last few years with a sociotechnical 
design brief.4Such design thinking5sits alongside work on, for example, specu -
lative fiction that draws on existing literary genres (such as sci-fi and cli-fi; 
Truman, 2022 ) to pose new questions of future directions, collaborative work 
on sensing that re-positions knowledge production around future collective 
concerns (Gabrys, 2019 ), and public reporting that seeks to challenge and redir -
ect existing relations of tech innovation (see, for example, The Institute for 
Technology in the Public Interest, Bug Reports). These developments 
suggest the very nascent emergence of a set of counter points to common 
futures narratives which seek to work both in and beyond academia simul -
taneously to challenge the path dependencies of contemporary modes of inno -
vation. It is too early to assess the likelihood of these endeavours bringing into 
being new epistemic counter-capitalisms in the field of futures. Nonetheless, 
there appears to be a coalescing of activities around futures methods as political 
interventions.
Discounting the future
Drawing this work on futures together, we can note politics of inclusion and 
exclusion, value composition, embodied constraints and efforts to challenge 
taken-for-granted future pathways. In this way, futures and an ever-emerging 
politics are entwined. Liliana Doganova’s new book, Discounting the future, 748 Economy and Society
takes its place among these future-oriented works, building on many of the 
themes we have already encountered and also posing new questions about 
the politics of futures work.
For Doganova (2024 ), discounting provides a key means to grasp futures in 
the present to give us the chance to act. She suggests that ‘Discounting is a way 
of determining the value of something in order to set its price. To do so, dis-
counting looks at the future: it contemplates the flows of costs and revenues 
that the thing being valued is likely to generate over its lifetime and translates 
the value of these future costs and revenues in the present by applying to them a 
“discount rate”’ (Doganova, 2024 , p. 33). The discount rate reflects the risk 
that the future value may not be fully achieved. In this way, a heavier discount 
rate might be applied to a future outcome that is more distant in time and thus 
might be said to represent a more significant risk. Placing a value on the future 
outcome enables investors to decide if the likely return is worth pursuing, or in 
other situations, may enable policymakers to decide if the cost of an interven -
tion is worth pursuing.
What is especially notable, then, is the arrow of time is reversed in compari -
son to the studies of technology development we considered above. Instead of a 
move from present to future, discounting focuses on a move from future to 
present. In place of a consideration of increasing value – with investments 
made now leading to greater benefit in the future – we have decreasing value 
via discounting that reflects distances in time and levels of uncertainty that 
the future in focus can or will be accomplished. In a similar manner to 
Maurer’s (2002 ) work on futures that we considered above, Doganova suggests 
that contemporary critiques of discounting are based on claims that it is unable 
to accurately calculate, provides unreliable projections of the future, and is 
open to manipulation and abuse. She posits a need to move away from the criti-
cism that discounting has uncertain foundations because the future is itself 
uncertain or because there is no rational way to conjure the future. Instead, 
we need to address why discounting does work and what work it does. We 
can thus move away from thinking the future is uncertain to consider ‘when 
and how uncertainty is mobilized and by whom, what form it takes, and 
what effects it produces’ (Doganova, 2024 , p. 171).
Drawing on the biopharmaceutical industry, Doganova suggests that 
uncertainty becomes a responsibility taken on by investors and a risk they 
take on to be rewarded through profit. In this approach, uncertainty is capi-
talized, but uncertainty needs to be mobilized in the first place by the inves -
tors such that it can be capitalized. Rather than view uncertainty as a basis for 
critique, we need to look closely at how uncertainty becomes a focus for 
action. In another example, Doganova draws on the extractive industries as 
early adopters of discounted cash flow (DCF) formulas. DCF has operated 
as a basis to dematerialize mines, for example, into future flows owned by 
investors. In this sense, investors don’t want to own fossil fuels in the tra-
ditional sense of holding those stocks. Instead, a ‘defining characteristic of 
discounting lies in its ability to translate a problem of ownership into a Daniel Neyland: Futures work 749
problem of valuation’ (Doganova, 2024 , p. 249). DCF allows for future uncer -
tainty to be incorporated into the value placed on a future flow. This, in 
effect, reduces the specificity of fossil fuels and their uncertainties at least 
to the extent that the formula can be modified to take these uncertainties 
into account and then show how the present value of the fossil fuels compares 
to other entities given the same treatment.6
The uncertainty critique only holds if we assume that discounting ought to 
be assessed on its ability to discern the future with accuracy. Doganova (2024 ) 
suggests this is not always the case. Discounting is less focused on the precise 
forms of what the future will comprise and is more interested in valuation. 
Rather than an attempt at fulsome prediction, discounting asks how distant 
is the future and what worth should it be accorded? This not only shapes 
how we perceive the future, but sets some grounds for the present. As Doga -
nova suggests: ‘I have not been interested in whether discounting represents 
truthfully or usefully the future and the value of things, but in what it does 
when it is mobilized’ (p. 258).
By looking at how discounting opens opportunities to act in the present 
towards the future, especially for investors, attention is shifted away from a ten-
dency to otherwise reduce discounting to a straightforward, technical process. 
Instead, discounting is recognized to introduce a politics of its own: ‘the future 
is a political domain – that is, a domain over which actors struggle to acquire the 
capacity to act’ (Doganova, 2024 , p. 19). By opening up this question – who and 
what has a capacity to act on the future – Dognaova’s study of discounting 
introduces specific forms of politics which extend those which have preoccu -
pied STS futures work to date. At the centre of questions around formulas 
for discounting which enable a value to be placed in the present on a future 
activity, is a concern for who or what gets to speak on behalf of futures, presents 
and pasts. As Doganova (2024 ) puts it: 
Discounting deserves our scrutiny … because its mundaneness hides significant 
consequences for how we have come to conceive of the future and because its tech-
nical aspects hide fundamental political questions about the capacity of certain 
actors and the incapacity of others to picture the future and act on it. (p. 8)
This returns us to our earlier consideration of the politics of definition and 
inclusion/exclusion but framed in a specific manner. To control something as 
mundane as the formula through which, for example, a DCF model operates, is 
to set the parameters through which futures enter the present. Once futures are 
grasped in this way and given form in the present, then multiple further actions 
can take place (valuation, investment, trading, regulation, see below). To be 
involved in defining the formula, then, is to establish (to a degree) how the uncer -
tainties of futures are displaced by an actionable future-in-the-now. For the formula 
to be able to translate future uncertainties into an actionable present, requires that 
the basis for calculating future value, and building uncertainty into that calculation, 
can be rendered witnessable. DCF enables this witnessing. And we have not strayed 750 Economy and Society
too far from the politics that we noted in relation to patents and the futured con-
straints these might impose – discounting, through specific formulas, also puts in 
place now, constraints on how the future is enacted.
Since its origins in forestry, which Doganova skilfully traces through the book, 
discounting has now progressed from a specific formula to a form of reasoning. 
However, the politics of discounting has persisted. Using climate concerns as an 
illustrative example, Doganova suggests that prior to the 2006 Stern Review, the 
discounted future costs of an environmental policy were often subtracted from its 
benefits in a rudimentary manner. The net benefit of an intervention would then 
often be zero or even negative due to the long timeframes involved. The more 
distant a future, the more stark the discounting. The Stern Review challenged 
this orthodoxy – the proposal was put forward that if climate policy is about 
future generations, then we need to bring those generations into the here and 
now and view climate change mitigations as an investment. The focus of dis-
counting (that places a lower value on the future than the present and holds 
the focus steady on the future as the arena for action) could lead to climate inac-
tion. Who and what speaks on behalf of who and what in setting the terms of the 
discounting formula, establishes or diminishes the prospects for intervention. 
Representing not just the future as an abstract entity, but future people, could 
underpin a change in the values derived through discounting. Climate interven -
tions could now be seen as worthwhile and indeed urgent.
To emphasize these concerns further, Doganova draws on Innerarity (2012 ) to 
expand upon the temporal politics at issue. Here we are encouraged to consider 
the tyranny of the present, where profit over investment, short-term gains and 
motifs of consumption, provide an imperialism not of space but of time. The 
future is colonized by bringing it into the present and feeding off it parasitically. 
As with climate change, we have already consumed away in the present what 
would have been future options. A focus on preserving things challenges the 
tyranny of the present. This might reduce short-term profit margins in the 
here-and-now, but it might also benefit the future. So, imperialism could work 
the other way too. The future (a need for a viable planet) could colonize the 
present (countering short-termism through preservation). The focus of discount -
ing on devaluing the future needs to be challenged for this shift to be presentable 
and achievable as an alternative pathway for action in the present on the future.
From this example of climate intervention, then, we can see that discounting 
becomes a form of governance. The precise terms of discounting formulas 
become a political arena through which settlements need to be achieved on how 
the future will be brought into the present to be acted on. Climate policy is not 
the limit of government intervention through discounting. Doganova (drawing 
on the work of Peter Miller, 1991 ) suggests that discounting has been used by gov-
ernments to act on firms at a distance. Discounting has become an imposed instru -
ment through which firms can demonstrate their responsibilities. And increasingly, 
discounting has also become a way for government to manage itself.
We can illustrate this movement of discounting into governance and govern -
ment by going beyond Doganova’s book for a moment to consider various Daniel Neyland: Futures work 751
current struggles for the UK government. For example, since loans were intro -
duced for higher education student fees and a decision taken that those loans 
would only become repayable once a graduate has achieved a certain salary 
threshold, the future value of the loans in the present needed to be continually 
adjusted. As the government looked to sell these loan books to private investors, 
concerns were raised by members of parliament about certain universities and 
the value of certain degree programmes where it appeared graduates typically 
progressed into lower paid jobs. What are now termed ‘low value degrees’7
where students earn lower future salaries, are put under pressure as the 
present value of loan books is undermined. A considerable discount rate 
needs to be applied to achieve a sale of these loan books where a high proportion 
of students look likely to earn below the salary threshold required to repay the 
loans (Milyaeva & Neyland, 2020 ). This is not simply a case of government bor-
rowing the tools of industry to ensure prudent financial management – dis-
counting helps establish the future viability of UK universities. Through 
Doganova’s work we can come to see how government, governance, discount -
ing and futures are intricately intertwined.
Conclusion
Futures of different kinds have had a persistent presence in STS work since its 
inception. Doganova’s new book adds to this work, posing new questions and 
pushing the field in new directions through an up close and detailed study of dis-
counting. Moving away from any counter assumption that discounting is merely 
a matter of straightforward formulas, Doganova shows how forests in the nineteenth 
century provided a point of origin for calculating future value. Faced with the chal-
lenge of how to calculate value not represented by current market price but by some -
thing the trees will grow into, inspired the birth of discounting. The book traces 
how, through the twentieth century, discounting became a tool – DCF – that 
helped shape investment decisions. But the forest also remained a focus for dis-
counting, becoming a laboratory for economists to experiment with futures and dis-
counting, but also for government to experiment with governance. As we have seen, 
discounting has become much more than a formula for translating the abstract and 
uncertain future into the present. As discounting provides a basis for acting on the 
future in the present, a politics of discounting has emerged. As Donganova (2024 ) 
suggests, the ‘present and the future are not only alternate temporalities of valuation, 
but also conflicting political domains’ (p. 86).
Doganova’s text allows us to engage with these politics of futures and presents 
in different ways and through different motifs of STS work. For example, we can 
return to the work of Akrich (1992 ) to explore the movement between the world 
inscribed in the object and the world described by its displacement. Except now 
we are urged to look to the world inscribed into DCF and the world that is (in the 
present) and is to be (in the future) described by its displacement. Grasping these 
displacements through discounting provides the means to act on the present and 752 Economy and Society
somewhat grasp or even shape the future. Yet the politics of discounting is not 
absented here: who and what gets to describe and displace on behalf of who 
and what remains a key question. How uncertainty is managed remains con-
tested. The present becomes blurred by future projections and the future projec -
tions do not work on the basis of accuracy, but on the basis of translating the 
future into a manageable entity – a value to be worked on.
Where does Doganova’s work sit in relation to our previous themes noted in STS 
futures work of definition, inclusion and exclusion, value composition, embodied 
constraints and designerly efforts to challenge taken for granted future pathways? 
As we saw with the example of climate interventions, discounting is not a neutral 
tool. Who gets to set the formula, how the formula is configured, and the futures 
this makes available to act on, need to be considered.8This is not a particularly 
inclusive or democratic process. The future to be acted on now is made visible in 
specific forms, particular kinds of value (and risk) are inscribed into both the 
future and the distinct paths of intervention that could be taken (providing a back-
drop to discussions of matters like costs and benefits). The outcomes of specific dis-
counting formulas are thus a set of constraints within which action takes place.
But what of political action and intervention? We can trace out the politics of 
discounting and we can make apparent the limitations and difficulties of par-
ticipation in discounting processes. Through Doganova’s work, we can see 
that via discounting, questions of what should be done become questions of 
is it worth it? This opens up the political terrain where challenges need to be 
made. If discounting is to remain as a key means for bringing the future into 
the present to be acted on, thereby retaining its centrality as a logic of govern -
ance, then we need to shape discussions of what values are to be inscribed into 
discounting in order to shape what future displacements are described. In order 
to take part in futures work, we need to be fully informed of how futures work.

more or less equivalent, to be assessed through the same formula.
