Disentangling war and disease in post -conﬂ ict Colombia
beyond technoscienti ﬁc peacemaking

ABSTRACT
In November 2016, the Colombian government and the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed a peace
agreement to end a 52-year war. In the context of the peace dealimplementation, I ethnographically traced entanglements of
biomedicine, public health and the armed con ﬂict across shifting
temporalities and realities of war and peace. Through anexploration of past, present and future (dis)entanglements of war
and leishmaniasis –a vector-borne disease known by many in
Colombia as “the subversive disease ”or the “guerrilla disease ”–
this article traces a discourse that frames health problems, likeleishmaniasis, only as scienti ﬁc or technological challenges. Drawing
on STS critiques of future-oriented timelines in technoscience andthe concept of pharmaceuticalization, I argue that the expectationsembedded in technoscienti ﬁc innovation problematically limit the
possibilities of disentangling leishmaniasis and war in post-con ﬂict
Colombia. In contrast, ethnographically exploring how health
policies and biomedicine have nurtured violence and exclusion
helps us destabilize the warfare-loaded meaning and experience ofleishmaniasis. This approach enables us to move beyond
imaginaries of technoscienti ﬁc peacemaking ,w h i c hId e ﬁne as the
excessive trust endowed to technoscience to (re)build a peacefulfuture, especially when we are faced with failures in understanding
the involvement of technoscience in the production andperpetuation of violence.

RESUMEN
En noviembre de 2016, el gobierno colombiano y las Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) ﬁrmaron un acuerdo
de paz para poner ﬁn a una guerra de 52 años. En el contexto de
la implementación del acuerdo de paz, rastreé etnográ ﬁcamente
los enredos de la biomedicina, la salud pública y el con ﬂicto
armado a través de las cambiantes temporalidades y realidadesde la guerra y la paz. A través de una exploración de los
(des)enredos pasados, presentes y futuros de la guerra y laleishmaniosis, una enfermedad transmitida por vectores conocida
por muchos en Colombia como “la enfermedad subversiva ”ol a
“enfermedad de la guerrilla ”, este artículo describe un discurso
que trata problemas de salud como la leishmaniosis, solo como
desafíos cientí ﬁcos o tecnológicos. Retomando las críticas
orientadas al futuro de STS en la tecno ciencia y el concepto de la
farmaceuticalización, sostengo que las expectativas incorporadas
en la innovación tecnocientí ﬁca limitan de manera problemática
las posibilidades de desenrredar la leishmaniosis y la guerra en la
Colombia postcon ﬂicto. En contraste, una exploración etnográ ﬁca
de las formas en las que las políticas de salud y la biomedicinahan nutrido a la violencia y la exclusión, nos ayuda a
desestabilizar el signi ﬁcado y la experiencia cargados de guerra de
la leishmaniosis. Este enfoque nos permite ir más allá de los
aspectos imaginarios de la paci ﬁcación tecnocientí ﬁca, que de ﬁno
como la con ﬁanza excesiva otorgada a la tecnociencia para (re)
construir un futuro pací ﬁco, especialmente cuando nos
enfrentamos a fallas en la comprensión de la participación de la
tecnociencia en la producción y perpetuación de la violencia.
In August 2016, a month before going to Colombia to start my ethnographic ﬁeld research,
my partner and I decided to go for a 10-day vacation to Cuba. In Havana, we walked to the
Palco Hotel early one morning to meet a tour bus. At the hotel, we saw a cameraman and areporter interviewing Iván Cepeda, a left-wing Colombian senator who has played aTAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY 95
signiﬁcant role in denouncing state crimes that have taken place during the more than 50-
year long Colombian war. Later, we saw him walking away with Álvaro Leyva, a conserva-
tive prominent ﬁgure in Colombian politics and one of the key actors in the peace dialo-
gues that were taking place at that time in Havana between the Colombian government
and the largest and oldest guerrilla organization –the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, FARC. Unknowingly and without planning for it, we were at the hotel where
peace in Colombia had been under negotiation for almost four years. As Colombianswho had been heartedly and optimistically supporting the peace dialogues, my partner
and I were enthusiastic.
It took almost four hours for the bus to pick us up. As the morning progressed, we almost
forgot about it and enjoyed observing how the hotel lobby became crowded with journal-ists and members of both delegations –the state ’s and the FARC ’s. Cuba ’s relaxed sense of
time allowed us to have an unpredicted close-up look at a major event in Colombia ’s history
that, until then, we had only witnessed from afar, through the media. Unexpectedly, it alsogave us the unique opportunity to meet and talk for about three hours with Francisco,
1a
guerrilla member who was also at the hotel entrance waiting for someone to arrive. Once
we found out that he belonged to the FARC delegation, I started asking him questions
related to leishmaniasis,2the vector-borne and parasitic disease that was at the center of
my research. He, a mid-rank commander with FARC for 28 years, had already lost count
of the times he had su ﬀered from leishmaniasis. However, he had never been asked
about this illness, which is considered by many in Colombia “the subversive disease ”or
“the guerrilla disease. ”3Thus, Francisco was happy to share his own experiences with leish-
maniasis and the consequences of the state ’s restrictive control on the circulation of anti-
leishmanial drugs. He was also curious to learn more about an illness that has a ﬀected
almost every combatant of the Colombian war –soldiers and members of guerrilla and
paramilitary organizations –as well as civilians who, for one reason or another, have
become exposed to the selva4and the leishmaniasis-transmitting sand ﬂies that inhabit it.
I was about to start my ﬁeld research on this disease as an illustrative instantiation of the
ways in which biomedicine, public health and war have become closely related in Colom-bia. At that time, it was clear to me that the voices of guerrilla (ex) combatants had to bepresent in my work. Although I had already contacted people working for the state insti-
tution in charge of guerrilla members ’processes of demobilization and reintegration into
civilian life, authorization to conduct interviews with ex-combatants was a long and still

2Biomedicine describes two major forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous and visceral. While the latter can be deadly and con-
stitutes a serious problem in other countries, 97% of all leishmaniasis cases in Colombia correspond to the cutaneous
form (MinSalud 2010 ), a disease that manifests as growing sores on the skin. Unless otherwise indicated, in this
paper I use the term leishmaniasis to refer to cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is the illness my research is concerned with.
3In Colombia, leishmaniasis is not only viewed as an illness that is speciﬁc to guerrillas (see, for instance, Acevedo Serna
2012 ; El Tiempo 2008 ,2015 ), but also as a disease that is characteristic of the armed con ﬂict. More recently, after the
peace agreements were signed, leishmaniasis has even been called “the post-con ﬂict disease ”(see Vélez and Pérez 2016 ).
4Selva is a Spanish word that is usually translated into English as “forest, ”“tropical forest ”or“jungle. ”While both “selva ”and
“jungle ”hold colonial, civilizatory and modernizing connotations (Ospina 2014 ; Rodríguez 1997 ), I draw on Kristina
Lyons ’s(2016 ) take on selva throughout this paper. Choosing selva over other words avoids leading the reader to
tropes that have more to do with histories and geographies of the British Empire and less with colonial and development
struggles and debates in South America. I also choose the noun selva to highlight how reductionist it is to make it into
“forest. ”“Forest ”makes invisible the exuberant biodiversity underlying the messy, relational and metamorphic nature of
selva, and also the ways in which selva becomes deeply entangled with human and more-than-human phenomena –
such as leishmaniasis –that develop within it.96 L. P. GARCÍA
uncertain process. Thus, I felt tremendously fortunate when Francisco told me by phone,
some days after our conversation at the hotel, that it was possible to arrange a meeting in
Colombia with FARC members to discuss their experiences with leishmaniasis. That
meeting became possible half a year later, in February 2017, three months after thepeace deal was signed.
I happened to be in Havana, in that hotel, in the very nick of time. Three days later, the
government and FARC delegations pronounced the successful end of the negotiations,and went back to Colombia. Still in Cuba, I became aware of this unanticipated andtruly remarkable news when I came across a Granma newspaper –the iconic daily of
the Cuban regime –announcing peace in Colombia as “a victory of all ”(Figure 1). Oscil-
latory temporalities and realities between war and peace marked my days in Cuba, aswell as my entire research process of making sense of “the guerrilla disease ”through
the tactics of participant observation and ethnographic inscription. It was there, inHavana, that my research unexpectedly started and a crucial part of my ﬁeldwork
became suddenly possible. I had written a project to study the entanglements of

leishmaniasis and war, but I soon realized that my research was going to be about an
illness and its becomings across an unﬁ nished con ﬂict and a nascent peace.5
This paper is part of a larger project that ethnographically traces the links between
leishmaniasis, the Colombian armed con ﬂict, and the aspirational logics of peace. Of
course, leishmaniasis is not the only disease a ﬀecting combatants of the Colombian
war, but I have decided to pay close attention to this non-contagious, non-deadly and
curable disease because it is a highly emblematic instantiation of the ways in which bio-medicine, public health and warfare have become entangled in Colombia.
6My research
(Pinto Garcia Forthcoming ) has allowed me to understand the state’ s restrictive control
on antileishmanial drugs as a warfare strategy based on measures and arguments sup-ported by global health guidelines, public health regulations, and biomedical knowledge
and practices. Likewise, I expose how scienti ﬁc research on leishmaniasis has been shaped
by war and how the work and lives of leishmaniasis researchers have su ﬀered from war;
but also how the production of biomedical knowledge draws on and is organizedaround the violence and the structural inequalities faced by those a ﬀected by this
disease in rural Colombia. I also explore the involvement of the state in the production
of the stigma attached to leishmaniasis, something not necessarily exceptional or
recent in the history of Colombia, but that very much resonates with the history of
another skin and stigmatizing disease –leprosy (Obregón 1996 ,2002 ; Platarrueda
Vanegas 2008 ). In the course of my research, I have followed soldiers, guerrillas, military
dogs, scientists, public health o ﬃcers, and civilians through a multi-sited approach
(Fortun 2009 ; Marcus 1995 ) involving various localities where the crossroads between
the disease, war, and peace are traceable in the everyday. However, this paper drawson ethnographic experiences at three ﬁeld sites in particular: the largest international
scienti ﬁc conference on leishmaniasis; one of the rural zones where FARC members gath-
ered as one of the early steps of the peace deal implementation; and a town on thesouthern Paci ﬁc coast a ﬀected by both leishmaniasis and the con ﬂict.
Entanglement is a powerful concept, inspired by quantum physics, which acquired rec-
ognition with Karen Barad ’s work ( 2007 ) and has been very productive in STS. In physics,
two particles are said to be “entangled ”when, although being separated in space, they
cannot be independently described because the state of one is connected and dependent
on the state of the other. Alex Nading ( 2014 ), for example, has heavily drawn on the notion
of entanglement to illustrate the intricate, complex and unbreakable connections between
objects, humans and non-humans that make up dengue –indestructible relations whose
subtraction would render incomplete any understanding of this vector-borne disease.While my inquiry relies on entanglement ’s relational emphasis to describe how and why
leishmaniasis and the armed con ﬂict have established complex links to each other, I
5So far, I have used the words “peace ”and “post-con ﬂict ”interchangeably. However, the use of these terms has been chal-
lenged in Colombia as a result of the transitional moment the country is going through. Although the government and
the FARC signed a peace accord, violence is still very much present in the country, and the con ﬂict is far from being over.
In other words, speaking of “post-con ﬂict ”or“peace ”does not yet re ﬂect the lived reality. As a result, many avoid using
that terminology and prefer to talk about the current period as posacuerdo (post-accord). I have chosen to use the words
“peace ”and “post-con ﬂict ”because this paper grapples precisely with the hopes and promises of a non-violent and
healthy future. For a scholarly problematization of the multiple connotations, dangers, expectations, and war-mediated
deﬁnitions of the term “peace, ”see the work of Sara Koopman ( 2017 ).

versity in Toronto, Canada.98 L. P. GARCÍA
refrain from seeing these two phenomena as inseparable. I contend that leishmaniasis and
war can break the ties that have attached them in war times and should constitute another
type of relationship –a disentangled one –in peace times. In other words, I use entangle-
ment to highlight the convoluted and messy relations holding together leishmaniasis and
war in Colombia, but I also envision their disentanglement as a complex, yet possible andurgent task if peace inspires our ambitions.
Taking inspiration from Hochman, Liscia, and Palmer’ s work ( 2012 ), in this paper I am
thinking of leishmaniasis as a disease that simultaneously carries the antithesis of the
nation in war times and the promise of national redemption in peace times. I show how
materialities, hopes and disputes brought about by the peace agreements framed theethnographic present of my ﬁeld research, but also narratives about past entanglements
of leishmaniasis and the armed con ﬂict, and the imaginaries of this disease in a forthcom-
ing post-con ﬂict scenario. An ethnography that is immersed in Colombia ’s unstable
transition between war and peace is simultaneously involved in understanding our past
violences and imagining what a non-violent future would look like. Through an explora-
tion of what leishmaniasis should become in peace times, this text traces a discoursethat commonly frames health problems –like leishmaniasis –only as scienti ﬁc or techno-
logical challenges. As this discourse leaves aside the cultural, political and historicaldimensions that make up an illness into both a social and a biological phenomenon, Iargue that the expectations and promises embedded in technoscience problematicallylimit the possibilities of disentangling leishmaniasis and war in post-con ﬂict Colombia.
In contrast, an ethnographic understanding of the multiple ways in which health policiesand biomedicine have nurtured violence and exclusion helps us destabilize the warfare-loaded meaning and experience of leishmaniasis. What is more, the ethnographic
approach enables us to move beyond imaginaries and strategies relying on what I call
technoscienti ﬁc peacemaking . This is a term I use to refer to the excessive trust endowed
to science, technology and innovation to (re)build a peaceful future, especially when we
are faced with failures in understanding the involvement of technoscience in the pro-
duction and perpetuation of violence.
The paper is organized in four sections. First, I theoretically frame the complexities of
exploring a violent past and a hopeful future when the present is experienced as an
unstable oscillation between war and peace. I also relate these oscillatory temporalities
and realities of war and peace with critiques on future-oriented visions of technoscience.In the next two sections, I draw on ethnographic moments and experiences to illustrate
the entanglements of war and leishmaniasis, and a discourse that problematically
frames their disentanglement as a biomedical problem with a pharmaceutical solution.Finally, I conclude by exploring this discourse through the notion of technoscienti ﬁc peace-
making , which problematizes the role science, technology and innovation can actually
play in the construction of a peaceful future.
1. Oscillating times
Feminist philosopher of biology Elizabeth Grosz ( 2004 ) has drawn attention to the nicks of
time, disruptions when time ’s relentless movement forward becomes noticeable –
instances in which temporality comes to the fore. She writes that “we can think [time]
only in passing moments, through ruptures, nicks, cuts, in instances of dislocation,TAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY 99
though it contains no moments or ruptures and has no being or presence, functioning
only as continuous becoming ”(2004 , 5). After more than 50 years of ongoing war, the
signing of a peace deal in Colombia marks that kind of nick in time, introducing a crack
in the narratives, realities and materialities of war. As a new reality many of us have not
known in our lifetime, peace’ su nﬁnished, open-ended and emergent lifeworld ﬂows
from causal connections in the past and induces new modes of being and thinking
about both previous events in history and the futures we want to bring into existence.
When I decided to embark on an ethnographic study about leishmaniasis and the
armed con ﬂict, the peace dialogues between the FARC and the government of the two-
term President Juan Manuel Santos (2010 –2014 and 2014 –2018) were well underway.
When the negotiations o ﬃcially started in 2012 in Havana, few Colombians imagined
they would last almost four years and even fewer thought they would be successful.The dissertation proposal I wrote in mid-2016 talked about a hopeful and optimistic,but still hesitant, temporally unpredictable, and yet-to-be-seen peace deal. My ethno-
graphic ﬁeldwork, however, began two weeks after FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño –
better known by his war name ‘Timochenko ’
7–and President Santos signed the peace
accords, and one week after the plebiscite seeking popular support for the rati ﬁcation
of the ﬁnal agreement had been rejected with just 50.2% of the population voting
against. In other words, my ﬁeld research started at a rupture in time where Colombia
entered into a very uncertain situation, felt by many as a political and historical limbo
from which the government came out weakened, and the right-wing opposition –the
ones campaigning against the peace agreements –strengthened.
By popular vote, the “no”to the peace agreements had won by a slim majority. The gov-
ernment devised a quick- ﬁx to this unsettling situation by signing a revised version of the
peace deal on November 24, 2016, which was rati ﬁed by Congress less than a week later.
Finally, there was a peace agreement in place, but the popular and political support acrosssociety was –and still is –far from uniform. During the negotiations, peace became a
highly contentious issue and, with the plebiscite results, the subsequent implementationof the peace agreements su ﬀered even more from this polarization within Colombian
society. In spite of the fact that the FARC acronym no longer belongs to a guerrillaforce but to an unarmed political party,
8and that the homicide rate in 2017 was the
lowest in 42 years (El Espectador 2018 ), we are still struggling to build peace amidst con-
tinuing violence, insu ﬃcient political will to materialize the agreements, and the unre-
solved murders of 343 social leaders since January 1, 20169–a number that continues
to grow tragically week by week as this paper goes to publication. Moreover, the right-wing candidate Iván Duque won the presidential elections in June 2018. During his gov-ernment, which began in August 2018 and will last four years, the peace agreements run
the risk of being neglected or torn apart.
Theﬁeld research I conducted between October 2016 and December 2017 would not
have been possible without the guarantees of the peace agreements. Practicing
7Names within single quotation marks are nombres de guerra or war names guerrilla members choose and start using once
they become part of guerrilla organizations.
8The acronym FARC used to stand for Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia). As a result of the peace deal signed in November 2016, ex-guerrilla members founded a political party in
August 2017 and, since then, FARC stands for Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Común (Common Alternative Revo-lutionary Force), a new name people in Colombia are still unfamiliar with.

ethnography in such a context –negotiating access to a variety of ﬁeld sites, traveling
through con ﬂict-ridden territories, conducting participant observation and in-depth inter-
views with actors from di ﬀerent sides of the con ﬂict –has shaped the modes of inquiry
I ended up adopting, the conversations I engaged in, and the broad spectrum of emotions
I experienced as an ethnographer in her homeland. In other words, my ethnography is
both a product and a struggle of that transition. While I have been able to do ethnographicresearch because of the promises, imaginaries and materialities of peace, I have alsostruggled to seepeace, avoid violence and open up spaces of hope for myself and
others. Thus, my research turned into a daily and embodied corroboration that “peace
is never clearly distinct from war” and “is not a separate end point to achieve in time or
space ”(Koopman 2017 , 1).
Taking inspiration from Grosz’ saﬃrmation of “the value of the nick, the cut or
rupture” (2004, 14), I have come to see my ethnographic tracing of the links that
hold leishmaniasis and the armed con ﬂict together as situated within an oscillating
temporality between war and peace. This means that I do not hope to claim any sortof stability or consolidation for the accounts , views, relations, things, stories, beings
and connections I have been able to trace by navigating a present that is always
borrowed and elusive. On the contrary, I have embraced what Biehl and Locke have
named an anthropology of becoming ,am o d eo fa t t e n t i o nt h a ti sb o t ho p e nt oa n d
unsettled by a sense of unﬁnishedness.
Becoming troubles our ways of knowing and acting. It pushes us to think against the grain, to
consider the uncertain and unexpected in the world, and to care for the as-yet-unthought thatinterrogates history and keeps modes of existence open to improvisation. We are tasked withthe otherwise. (Biehl and Locke 2017 ,x )
During my ﬁeldwork, I have not done away with the convoluted, uncertain, contradictory
and pessimistically hopeful world that the oscillation between war and peace has pro-
duced in Colombia. Trying to stay emotionally attuned and keep pace with the rapidly
changing lifeworld in which I became embedded, I have paid careful attention to(usually contradictory) notions and imaginaries of time –past, present and future –that
discursively and materially de ﬁne what leishmaniasis was (in war times), is and should
be (in peace times). What I am doing here is an exploration of “the temporal horizons
of [my] own work and thought, as they unfurl in [my] own relations with others ”
(Pandian 2012 , 549). Thinking with Pandian, I am making the vicissitudes of the political
reality of Colombia my own, letting them suffuse the ways in which I have exploredand answered questions about the past, present and future (dis)entanglements of leish-maniasis and war.
Science and technology studies (STS) have developed a rich critical analysis on
w h a tM a r i aP u i gd el aB e l l a c a s ah a ss u c c i n c t l yt e r m e d technoscienti ﬁcf u t u r i t y ,“the
hegemony of future-oriented timelines in technoscienti ﬁcs o c i e t i e s ”(2015 , 693). This
notion encompasses the predominance of a modernist vision that associates thefuture with advancement and locates science and technology along a progressivisttimeline that irreversibly moves forward. According to this critique, the past implies
a negative backwardness and the future is always promissory, full of expectations
regarding what innovation can bring (Borup et al. 2006). Science and technology
acquire legitimation through this vision, which mobilizes not only actors and resourcesTAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY 101
but also a ﬀects. Adams, Murphy, and Clarke ( 2009 ) have paid attention to anticipation ,
a future-oriented way of thinking and feelingt h a ti se s p e c i a l l ye v i d e n ta tt h ej u n c t i o n
of life and technoscience. “As an a ﬀective state, anticipation is not just a reaction, but
a way of actively orienting oneself temporally. Anticipation is a regime of being in
time, in which one inhabits time out of place as the future ”(Adams, Murphy, and
Clarke 2009,2 4 7 ) .A ss u c h ,t e c h n o s c i e n t i ﬁc futurity is problematically driven by uncri-
tical and often unrealistic expectations about what science and technology can do in
the future, with the con ﬁd e n c et h a ti tw i l lb ef o rt h eb e t t e ra n da l m o s tn e v e rf o rt h e
worse (Brown 2007).
Future-oriented expectations around biosciences and biotechnologies have also
drawn attention from sociologists and anthropologists of health and illness studying
processes of pharmaceuticalization –“the rede ﬁnition or recon ﬁguration of health ‘pro-
blems ’as having a pharmaceutical solution” (Williams, Martin, and Gabe 2011 , 721; see
also Dumit 2012 ). The tendency of using medicines to address a broad variety of problems
and situations, even non-medical ones, is embedded in future-oriented narratives,
imaginaries, and a ﬀects in which trust endowed to scientists and hope linked to pharma-
ceuticals play a crucial role (Brown et al. 2015 ). Trust in scientists and hope in medicines
importantly shape the horizon of possibilities people envisage in ways that let thembracket fearful uncertainties in the time to come while focusing on positive futures(Brown et al. 2015 ).
Drawing on these conceptual frameworks about the temporality of science and
technology, I will now discuss how oscillatory experiences of time, brought about bythe signature of a peace deal in Colombia, have shaped how leishmaniasis is regardedacross shifting tenses.
2. A war (disease) in the past?
WorldLeish is the largest scienti ﬁc conference on leishmaniasis worldwide, organized since
1997 and every four years in a leishmaniasis-endemic country. The last version of this
event –WorldLeish6 –took place in Toledo, Spain in May 2017, which gave me the oppor-
tunity to include this conference as one of my ﬁeld sites. After registering for the confer-
ence, I was astonished when I received an e-mail with the program and realized that thekeynote speaker giving the closing lecture was not a scientist but a Colombian politician –
Alejandro Gaviria, Minister of Health, whose talk was entitled Health and Con ﬂict in Colom-
bia: A Tragic Story with a Promising Future .
I did not have big expectations about Gaviria ’s talk. I thought he was going to frame the
relationship between the con ﬂict and leishmaniasis as public health and biomedical dis-
courses in Colombia usually do –by merely describing the former as a social determinant
of the latter, period. But he did not. It was the ﬁrst time I listened to a high ranking poli-
tician –the Minister of Health! –publicly recognizing that the association between these
two phenomena implied much more than a circumstantial and unfortunate coexistence
between leishmaniasis-transmitting sand ﬂies and combatants in the selva . In fact, he
acknowledged to an international audience of almost 1500 scientists that the Colombianstate has played a fundamental and reprehensible role in shaping the link between leish-maniasis and the war:102 L. P. GARCÍA
Leishmaniasis was a disease of con ﬂict in Colombia, was almost a symbol of our long and ter-
rible con ﬂict. Historically, leishmaniasis was used as an instrument of war . . . I grew up in the
city of Medellin . . . I was in my early twenties. One night, the doorman of the building, a quiet
man, came to our apartment. He knocked on the door lightly. He looked worried and scared.He told me he needed to talk to my father. My father had been mayor of Medellin and wasperceived as a man of in ﬂuence . . . He [the doorman] told my father that his brother had
been infected with leishmaniasis, with pito,
10P-I-T-O, and that it had been impossible to
get the medicine. I remember that my father blushed. I noticed immediately that he wasvery angry, full of moral indignation. The Army is retaining the medicine, he told me after-wards. They, he told me, are using this medicine as a weapon of war. Two weeks ago, onlytwo weeks ago, I went to one of the transitional zones where the guerrilla [the FARC] is con-centrating to hand-in their arms. I went to the pharmacy, and it was well stocked with the[leishmaniasis] medicine, with Glucantime. Now the medicine is provided by the government.A lot has changed in Colombia, I thought. Leishmaniasis is still a complicated health challenge,but it ’s no longer a symbol of indignity, it ’s no longer an instrument of war.
11
Astonished and positively surprised by Gaviria ’s statement, I found his assessment
also naïve and a bit demagogic. I was bothered by Gaviria ’su s eo ft h es i m p l ep a s t
form of the verb to be –“was ”–to talk about leishmaniasis, as if the ties holding
together this disease with warfare didn ’t exist anymore since my own research
suggested otherwise.
Alfredo Molano Bravo ( 2017 ,9–10) writes that there is no verb tense capable of appre-
hending the current Colombian reality, the constant oscillation between conﬂ ict and
peace. Currently, we cannot talk about war as if it were in the past and we cannot talk
about peace as if it were in the future.12After so much work has been done for
decades –primarily by the state –to stigmatize, harm and exclude leishmaniasis-
aﬀected people, it was highly misleading to assert that, with the arrival of peace, leishma-
niasis was no longer a war symbol or part of the continuous social interactions reprodu-
cing violence in Colombia ’s present and (near) future. It was also distorted to imply that
antileishmanial drugs were now easily accessible to anyone in rural Colombia. I had also
been in a transitional zone where members of the FARC guerrilla gathered for disarma-ment as agreed in the peace accords. However, the reality I witnessed there was quite
diﬀerent from that portrayed by Alejandro Gaviria.
In late February 2017, I spent four days at the Transitional Zone for Normalization in
Colinas, Guaviare.
13A few hours after my arrival, I was talking with several guerrilla com-
manders in the sketchy and temporary house –la caleta –of ‘Mauricio Jaramillo ’, the
FARC ’s Eastern Block commander. In that conversation, these men de ﬁned the drug
10Depending on the region, leishmaniasis is popularly known in Colombia as pito,guaral oryateví .
11Excerpt from the public speech given by Alejandro Gaviria, Colombia ’s Minister of Health, at the WorldLeish6 conference
in Toledo, Spain, on May 20, 2017.
12Carolina Sanín, a columnist of the Colombian magazine Arcadia , also wrote ( 2017 ) a beautiful re ﬂection on this (my
translation):
I wonder in what verbal tense we, Colombians, should narrate the war now, during the post-con ﬂict: should we
do it in imperfecto , which is the tense we use to tell dreams and nightmares that can come back and are always
present, even if they happen somewhere else? Or should we do it in pretérito simple , which indicates that some-
thing is in the past and ﬁnished? Or should we use the historical presente , to make war more vivid? Or the present
of the second-hand story, with which we tell the story or the ﬁlm that someone else composed?
13During the early implementation of the peace deal, 26 so-called Zonas Veredales Transitorias de Normalización (transition
and normalization zones) were established in rural areas of Colombia for FARC members to gather for months and lay
down their arms. Two of these zones –Colinas and Charras –were located in Guaviare, a departmento (state or province)
in the southern central region of Colombia whose capital is San José del Guaviare.TAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY 103
used to treat leishmaniasis –Glucantime –as the link connecting the disease with the war.
They were speci ﬁcally referring to the state ’s restrictive control over this treatment which –
echoing the words of Alfredo Molano Bravo ( 2005 )–they described as a perverse anti-sub-
versive strategy.
Francisco, the FARC mid-rank commander I had met in Havana and re-encountered in
Colinas, said the following:
The disease itself has no relation to the armed con ﬂict, the relationship with the armed con ﬂict
is the medicine to cure a tropical disease that a ﬀects the military, peasants, guerrillas, all the
inhabitants of the Colombian rurality. The involvement of leishmaniasis with the armed
conﬂict isﬁctitious. It is the medicine, the way in which the disease is treated, that in an irre-
gular con ﬂict like ours, like all irregular con ﬂicts, is full of traps, trickeries, feints.14
All the FARC members I talked to during my stay in Colinas had had leishmaniasis at least
once in their subversive lives. While I was there, among the nearly 500 guerrilla members
that had concentrated in Colinas, there were six suspected cases of leishmaniasis.
Although raspados –smear samples –had been collected a month prior by healthcare
practitioners working for the public hospital in San José del Guaviare, these six guerrilleros
and guerrilleras had not received the diagnostic test results. And without a parasitological
conﬁrmation of leishmaniasis –the observation of parasites under the microscope –Glu-
cantime could not be provided by the state, let alone administered.
Two scru ﬀy and dusty boxes of this drug, one with 5 and the other with 3 ampoules,
was all that was left in the FARC inﬁ rmary in Colinas ( Figure 2). They would have only
covered 3 out of 20 days of treatment for a single patient.15Both boxes came from Vene-
zuela, were produced in January 2013 and would expire in less than a year. Despite what
the Minister of Health had said at the WorldLeish conference, these boxes were not pro-
vided by the state. Instead, they were part of the Glucantime stocks that the FARC eitherbought from the black market which supplied(s) the medicine from Venezuela or Brazil, orpurchased from clandestine “entrepreneurs ”within the Army –corrupted military or inﬁ l-
trated guerrilla collaborators –who sold (or sell) the ampoules to guerrilla organizations at
exorbitant prices.
I met one more person with leishmaniasis in Colinas: Javier. He was not a FARC member
but a civilian –a young peasant who approached his guerrilla cousin to ask for help in
getting the treatment against leishmaniasis. Appealing to the legitimacy I supposedlyhad from having seen hundreds of leishmaniasis lesions during my ﬁeldwork, one of
the FARC commanders asked me if I could have a look at this young man’ s skin ulcer.
Javier took o ﬀhis hat with some shame, gently grabbed his left ear with the tip of his
ﬁngers, and moved it a little forward. The lesion was huge, supremely infected, and was
about to perforate his cartilage. Worried, I thought Javier could lose his ear and told theFARC commanders that the young man needed antileishmanial medicines as soon aspossible. This peasant told us he had been diagnosed positive for leishmaniasis in San
14I have written elsewhere about my ethnographic work in Colinas (Pinto Garcia 2017 ).
15Glucantime is the ﬁrst-choice drug used in Colombia to treat leishmaniasis. The treatment consists of two intramuscular
injections, one for each buttock, over the course of 20 days. The dose of pentavalent antimony –Glucantime ’s active
compound –is calculated based on the patient ’s weight. According to the guide standardizing the clinical practice
for leishmaniasis in Colombia (MinSalud 2010 ), a person weighing 70 kg, for example, would require 17.29 ml of Glucan-
time each day, for 20 days. This corresponds to 60 Glucantime ampoules, that is, 12 full boxes of the 5-ampoule ones that
were available in Colinas.104 L. P. GARCÍA
José.16Glucantime, however, was not available in the public hospital of this municipality,
which is not even a rural, remote or dispersed town –one of the excuses you often hear
when Glucantime is nowhere to be found in public healthcare facilities –but a departmen-
to’s main urban center, the capital of Guaviare.
Despite the fact that peace had started –at least on paper –three months before I was
in Colinas, guerrilla members in their transition to becoming ex-combatants still faced (and
probably still face as this goes to publication) problems accessing treatment. And the
restrictive control the state has on the circulation of Glucantime has continued to a ﬀect
rural populations who have systematically been stigmatized by the state, paramilitary
groups and the media –often with deadly consequences –as guerrilla collaborators.
Javier ’s case is not an isolated one. Most people in the Colombian rurality still confront
multiple obstacles in accessing both diagnosis and treatment for leishmaniasis. For this

disease to become “no longer a symbol of indignity ”and “no longer an instrument of war”
–as the Minister of Health said –much more is needed than a simple declaration. “It is still
necessary that, as a result of the peace process, the veto against the medicine that cures
leishmaniasis is lifted, it should not be restricted anymore, ”said Francisco. “That is some-
thing that was not discussed in Havana, ”said the other FARC commanders with regret.
3. A peace (disease) in the future?
Post-con ﬂict, we know, is not going to be easy. Peace is not going to solve all our problems.
Peace, by itself, is not going to end leishmaniasis. But I have reasons for optimism. There
are many good things going on in Colombia. We have increased our capabilities . . . Manyresearch groups in the country are trying new things, innovation in treatments and in newmedicines, they are an example to the world and a source of pride for our country. Let mecelebrate, ladies and gentlemen, the leadership of Colombia in leishmaniasis, in Chagas, inaccess to medicine, and so on. The presence of 50 Colombian researchers and publicoﬃcials in this congress is a sign of this leadership. We want to show to the world that
we are ready for peace, that we are ready to engage and lead a way in tropical medicineand other areas of knowledge. Peace is irreversible in my country. We want to leave behindal e g a c yo fh u m a ns u ﬀering and disease. We are conscious of the many challenges ahead,
but we are con ﬁdent in our collective capabilities. We strive, every day, to be a good
example for the world in building a peaceful and healthy society. It ’s life we want, no
more, no less than that.
These were the closing words of Colombian Minister of Health Alejandro Gaviria ’s
speech at the WorldLeish conference. Here, Gaviria links pharmaceuticals, innovation,
scienti ﬁc knowledge and scientists with a hopeful imaginary of peace that lies in the
future of Colombia. According to this view, the social practice of science and the develop-
ment of biomedical treatments and vaccines –under a progressivist and anticipatory
logic –will help us leave our violent past behind and bring us to a peaceful scenario
where the capacities of Colombian scientists will become materialized into pharmaceuticalsolutions to our long history of war. It is as if leishmaniasis was asked to simultaneously
embody Colombia’ s pathological past and the promise for a national redemption that
would bring Colombians closer to peace (Hochman, Liscia, and Palmer 2012 ). Under
Gaviria’ s perspective, biomedical technologies and scienti ﬁc innovations are just
enough, just what is needed for leishmaniasis to become disentangled from violenceand represent something di ﬀerent than “an instrument of war. ”In Gaviria ’s discourse,
trust in scientists and hope in medicines will bring us to a sort of pharmaceuticalized
peace in which leishmaniasis –but also war and violence –will be overcome.
This view is shared by some patients who see their involvement in clinical studies on
leishmaniasis as crucial for the promissory cures that science will bring to them andothers in the future. Ernesto Mina, a social leader in the rural area of Candelario
17–a
town in southwestern Colombia that has been profoundly a ﬀected by both the con ﬂict
and leishmaniasis –suﬀered from the disease some 25 years ago. He is part of a group
of community members who help a biomedical research institution, with a clinical facilityin Candelario, to recruit leishmaniasis patients, mainly for clinical studies. Remembering
the painful Glucantime injections he had to receive in the past, Ernesto told me this:
17This name is a pseudonym.106 L. P. GARCÍA
that ’s why now I have volunteered for this, for the research projects on leishmaniasis, for a new
cure that comes in the form of pills. I ’ve devoted myself 100% to this to avoid the su ﬀering of
future generations that might get this disease.
Similarly, in the opinion of Martha Díaz, one of the researchers of this biomedical insti-
tution, one of the main reasons why leishmaniasis patients agree to participate in clinicalstudies conducted by the organization she works for is because
people want to help, people feel that if that helps for something then they participate because
that will be useful for something. People feel that it does contribute something to humanity.People say “if I can contribute to the management of this disease and that others bene ﬁt, I
participate”
But Martha is also well aware that ﬁnding a new cure for leishmaniasis, as Ernesto and the
Minister of Health hope for, is far from realistic. Pentavalent antimonials such as Glucan-
time constitute the main treatment against this disease since the 1940s. It is also a
highly toxic drug that is injectable, painful, has a long treatment duration and, sometimes,does not even work. While there exist other drugs (miltefosine, amphotericin B, paromo-
mycin), each has its own drawbacks, mostly related to high levels of toxicity (see, for
example, Didwania et al. 2017 ; Olliaro et al. 2018 ). As such, one of the statements I
heard over and over at the WorldLeish conference was that there is currently no satisfac-
tory treatment for leishmaniasis and the situation will be the same for another 5 –7 years if
not more. Moreover, the enormous diversity associated with leishmaniasis was repeatedly
highlighted as a major challenge –it is almost impossible to come up with drugs or vac-
cines useful for all the species of Leishmania parasites, all types of patients, all clinical mani-
festations of the disease, in different regions of the world, for all and everybody (see, forexample, Akhoundi et al. 2017 ). Another related question is how willing or able are Colom-
bian scientists to participate in the development of new drugs or vaccines. While there are
some biomedical researchers in Colombia working with this goal in mind,
18many of them
regret that the lack of funds, infrastructural and technical capacities, and time needed to
engage in the full development of pharmaceuticals constitute a signi ﬁcant challenge that
only large pharmaceutical companies can assume if that represents an economic advan-tage for them –not exactly the case for leishmaniasis.
But beyond whether it is realistic or not to involve Colombian scientists in the develop-
ment of pharmaceuticals, the most important question here, I argue, is whether it is soundto frame the disentanglement of war and leishmaniasis as a biomedical problem with apharmaceutical solution that should primarily come from scientists working on drugand vaccine development.
4. Technoscienti ﬁc peacemaking and its future-oriented premises
Technoscienti ﬁc futurity is what underlies the discursive and aﬀ ective set of expec-
tations about the promises of science and innovation for Colombian peace. As notedby Adams, Murphy, and Clarke ( 2009 ), the futuristic orientation embedded in tech-
noscience mobilizes all sorts of emotions, mea ns, hopes and actors. Thus, it is ingenious
18Scientists at PECET (Program for the Study and Control of Tropical Diseases from the Antioquia University), Caldas Uni-
versity and the National University in Bogota, for example, are working on the early stages of drug development for
cutaneous leishmaniasis.TAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY 107
and strategic to tap into that discursive resou rce. Undeniably, achieving the signature of
the peace agreement in Colombia was not easy at all, and the implementation of this
agreement is currently at risk and facing multiple obstacles. Therefore, politicians likeGaviria resort to the optimism that science and technology discursively evoke, as well
as to many other discourses that –perhaps unrealistically and naïvely –provide
some hope.
But this strategy has its own pitfalls as it is also the result of failing to understand the
intricate entanglements of war and leishmaniasis that have discursively and materiallybeen constructed throughout a long history of violence. Interested in the pharmaceutica-
lization of peace –the rede ﬁnition or recon ﬁguration of war as a health problem with a
pharmaceutical solution –I devised the term technoscienti ﬁc peacemaking .
19This notion
highlights how the promissory expectations underlying the virtue of science, technologyand innovation are readily harnessed to bring peace into existence, while at the same timeneglecting and denying the ways in which technoscience itself has participated in the pro-
duction and perpetuation of violence.
My ethnographic work aims at making visible the ways in which leishmaniasis-related
biomedical knowledge, health policies and the materialities and discourses they sustainare entangled with the Colombian war. I have done this with the hopeful goal that,
once recognized, we can take apart the links that have attached war to every socio-culturalcorner of our society, including biomedical science, healthcare practices and public health.“To think about our attachments to war is something we cannot a ﬀord not to do ”(Terry
2017 , 9). Above all, the construction of a peaceful society demands a deep examination
and subsequent dismantling of the multiple ways and mechanisms through which vio-lence and logics of warfare have discursively and materially spread to sustain everyday
militarization. This is what is needed for leishmaniasis to be disentangled from war, for
its meaning as “the guerrilla disease ”to be destabilized so it can start symbolizing some-
thing di ﬀerent than a stigmatizing guerrilla mark and a legacy of warfare. Thus, trusting
blindly in technoscience does not ﬁx but deepens the problem. It allows the complex
mechanisms through which violence has been materially and discursively installed every-where in Colombia –even in the seemingly aseptic terrains of biomedicine and public
health –to remain untouched and unaltered. It is crucial to demand that scientists play
a major role in the peacebuilding process in Colombia. However, this cannot be doneby outlining a bright future of technoscienti ﬁc innovation that, at the same time, erases
the involvement of technoscience in warfare.
Oscillations between a violent past and a peaceful future su ﬀused my ethnographic
experience and the questions I asked of my ﬁeld sites and my informants. Willing to
think about the past and compelled to dream about the future –“tasked with the other-
wise, ”as Biehl and Locke ( 2017 , x) nicely put it –I have imagined di ﬀerent ways in which, I
believe, the meaning of leishmaniasis can start being transformed and set apart from vio-lence. Therefore, here I have questioned modes of thinking about the temporalities of
leishmaniasis, war and peace. On the one hand, these problematic perspectives do not
19Drawing on a classic work of peace studies (Galtung 1976 ), I prefer the term peacemaking over peacebuilding because
peacebuilding denotes the transformation of the structural, historical and complex conditions that have enabled violence
and war. In contrast, peacemaking refers only to preventive measures undertaken to avoid the reappearance of violentconﬂict, disregarding an in-depth understanding of the roots of violence that would make their transformation
attainable.108 L. P. GARCÍA
deal with the past but, instead, embrace anticipation as a regime in which time is inhabited
in a future-oriented way. On the other hand, technoscienti ﬁc expectations are projected
towards a peaceful future that is hardly attainable and unrealistic, partly because it
denies where the entanglement of leishmaniasis and war comes from and the involve-
ment of biomedicine, public health, scientists, public o ﬃcials and state agents in the
making of leishmaniasis as “the guerrilla disease.” We should think beyond technoscien-
tiﬁc peacemaking if we want to build a future where biomedicine and healthcare can
move away from enabling and producing war and injustice, and be repurposed towardsthe construction of a more peaceful and equal society. This is not only valid for leishma-
niasis but for all the multiple ways in which healthcare, illness, biomedical science andarmed con ﬂicts have become entangled in Colombia and other parts of the world.
