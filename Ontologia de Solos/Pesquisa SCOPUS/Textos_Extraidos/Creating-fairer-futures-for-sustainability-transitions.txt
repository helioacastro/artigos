Futures thinking is an expanding interdisciplinary field which 
is seen as a key element of transitioning towards a more 
sustainable planet and society. Developing fairer futuring is 
increasingly urgent in the context of the radical reconfigu -
ration of current systems needed to meet complex global 
sustainability challenges. However, explicit consideration 
of uneven power and participation and the nature-society 
relations that feature in contemporary futuring processes 
has been given little explicit attention to date. This deficit 
is addressed in this paper through a critical review of domi -
nant futuring approaches and outlining insights from critical 
perspectives which (a) identify limitations of current futuring 
approaches and (b) provide important perspectives to help 
shape fairer futuring in geographical research.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Global challenges, from pandemics to conflicts and climate change to biodiversity loss, have created greater pres -
sures on society to envisage more sustainable futures as a pre-cursor to enacting them. This has seen an expan -
sion of future-orientated activities in industry, policy and academia (see, e.g., Davies,  2014a ; Davies & Doyle,  2015 ; 
Demneh & Darani,  2020 ; Etherington,  2009 ; Gupta et  al., 2020 ; IKEA,  2019 ; Vervoort & Gupta,  2018 ). Within geog -
raphy, creating and exploring alternative futures was historically dominated by quantitative and physical geographers, 
contributing to global scenarios (Barnes,  2008 ; Camacho,  2013 ; Manley et  al., 2017 ; Sitch et  al., 2008 ) and foresight 
exercises (OECD,  2016 ) for government and policy makers. Meanwhile, human geographers have worked to explore

how planning processes shape the nature and extent of participation of diverse publics within them, which then 
affects the physical and material form and experience of places (e.g., Davies,  2001 ). Nonetheless, to a large extent, 
more critical questions about the future and who should be involved in shaping visions for it, have remained marginal 
and marginalised (Raven & Stripple,  2020 ).
As Oomen et  al. (2021 ) note, the future is not ‘already pre-existing’ in a strict sense, articulations of it are certainly 
a point of orientation for action in the present. Constructions of the future give direction and structure to possible 
development pathways for societies and policies (Bell & Mau,  1971 ; Polak,  1973  in Oomen et  al., 2021 ). Despite the 
influential role of visioning for influencing decisions in the present about space, place and nature-society relations, 
the question of who is involved in creating future visions and the difference that makes to those visions has been 
given little critical attention to date. However, this needs addressing to avoid replicating or reinforcing inequali -
ties. Engaging with issues of access to, and participation in, futuring is vital given calls for just transitions and the 
United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (White,  2019 , 2020 ). Certainly, achieving a just transition 
towards sustainable development will not be possible without interrogating issues of access and power within futur -
ing practices, and ensuring fairer futuring approaches. This paper contributes directly to such efforts.
In this paper we provide a critical review of current futuring approaches with geographers in mind. Following a 
review of literature on futuring approaches particularly relevant to geography, this paper outlines how more critical 
perspectives could address shortcomings visible in current practices and then outlines a research agenda for fairer 
futuring.
2 | FUTURING: STATE OF THE ART
The field of futures research is significantly fragmented, leading to a lack of comprehensive knowledge about futuring 
practices (Fergnani,  2019 ). This makes a critical review of the literature all the more necessary, but also challenging. 
Studying, and seeking to shape, the future has taken many forms and has been enacted by different stakeholders—
from nation states and industry to academics—with quite different goals. As a result, futuring includes a range of 
activities and methodologies, from exploring the role of visions in innovation and technology dynamics as a method 
for problem solving around sustainability challenges, and the use of narratives and storytelling about imagined 
futures, to using foresight methods to explore possibilities for transformative change (Dignum et  al., 2018 ; Hebinck 
et al., 2018 ; Tussyadiah & Miller,  2020 ; Wiek & Iwaniec,  2014 ). In order to bound our analysis we adopt the definition 
of futuring identified by Millett,  2006  detailed in Tussyadiah and Miller  (2020 , p. 676) as ‘systematically thinking 
about the future’ in order ‘to identify emerging opportunities and threats,’ and ‘to anticipate actions that will promote 
desirable outcomes’.
Given the scope of the approaches and disciplines involved, this review is not exhaustive of all future-facing 
activity, rather it outlines key issues, themes, challenges and areas of interest to the geographical discipline in rela -
tion to just transitions and sustainability, including society-nature interactions and multi-scalar processes central to 
the achievement of sustainable transitions. It provides a state-of-the-art analysis to enable greater critical engage -
ment by the geographical discipline at the nexus of futuring and sustainability transitions. Drawing on the framing 
developed by Fergnani  (2019 ), which provides a systematic mapping of scholarly research in the field from 1968 to 
2018 (Fergnani,  2019 ), three major clusters of futuring are reviewed: Corporate foresight, environmental futures, and 
humanity at the limen.
2.1 | Corporate foresight
Corporate foresight exercises seek to produce actionable insights to benefit corporate actors (Fergnani,  2019 ) which 
become manifest in corporate strategies and commercial products. These exercises are relevant to geographical FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

research concerned with sustainability transitions as they create real world impacts, for example, in terms of stim -
ulating production and consumption processes which themselves affect resource use. The development of the 
automobile—and Henry Ford's ‘car for the masses’, for instance, altered the ‘planning of cities, suburbs, urban design, 
rural life, retail shopping, tourism, leisure and more’ (Fry,  2009 , p. 39 in Clune & Pollastri,  2020 , p. 92), deeply affect -
ing a range of activities from mobility patterns to how and what food was consumed in cities. More recently, the need 
to reconfigure food systems has seen significant investments from venture capitalists into the development of alter -
native proteins (REINVENT,  2020 , p. 63), indoor vertical private farms, and other corporate- and technology-led food 
innovations. These innovations tend to address some aspects of our unsustainable food system (e.g., reducing emis -
sions from animal farming and from food transport), yet they are rarely subjected to full sustainability assessments 
and tend to focus on market opportunities to exploit rather than addressing issues of social or ecological justice.
Being focused on commercial product development, as with the Philips design probes (Etherington,  2009 ), or 
on how to navigate uncertainty and develop strategic thinking, such as the scenarios development conducted by 
Shell (Bentham,  2014 ), corporate foresight tends to work within the constraints of the current commercial system. 
Given the dependency of incumbent actors' interests in maintaining their market advantage, this often means such 
futuring seeks to stabilise the current system or, in the context of challenges such as decarbonisation, attempts to 
recalibrate activities within changing environments so as not to be negatively affected. Corporate foresight, in this 
sense, is predominantly focused on technological solutions to current issues that work within the prevailing system, 
while assuming that radical social system change (e.g. around lifestyle and consumption practices) is not (or is less) 
feasible than unproven technologies. White  (2019 ) suggests that this technocratic approach has become central 
to what he calls the current de-futuring project, which he argues is being used to propagate particular systems of 
production, consumption and disposal, and attendant lifestyles, thereby closing down the range of future possi -
bilities. As a result, many corporate-driven futuring exercises allow little space to test or challenge existing power 
relations (Leszczynski,  2016 ) and leave dominant growth narratives unproblematised and unquestioned (Curry & 
Hodgson,  2008 ). This is seen, for instance, in corporate-led visions of smart cities (Lee et  al., 2020 ), which are domi -
nated by technology and market-based conceptions of citizenship.  Such visions are not static, but are manifest in 
cities' approaches to sustainability transitions which prioritise and mobilise technology and corporate solutions (see 
Hagbert et  al., 2020 ). In sum, corporate futuring perspectives can be characterised as techno-optimistic, elevating 
dominant narratives and interests. Due to commercial competition, participants in futuring exercises are often limited 
to a suite of elite corporate professionals, with little space for wider stakeholder or citizen engagement in their devel -
opment, leaving matters of procedural, distributive and restorative justice unattended.
2.2 | Environmental futures
Escalating resource use and its role in creating climate and biodiversity crises has stimulated a range of environmental 
futuring exercises (Fergnani,  2019 , p. 113). Since the 1970s, such expositions of environmental futures have become 
dominated by increasingly sophisticated modelling of environmental change with climate modelling emerging as 
the dominant form of knowledge about climate futures (Davies,  2014b ; Raven & Stripple,  2020 ). However, scholars 
have argued that such framing has served to elevate technical fixes under the auspices of neoliberal governance 
(Castree,  2008 ; Demeritt,  2001 ). In the face of increasingly complex and dynamic environmental challenges, antic -
ipatory foresight approaches are being employed in order to explore alternative environmental futures. Strategic 
foresight, for example, is a method and practice used to create functional and operational views of possible futures, 
with a view to influencing today's decisions (Tõnurist & Hanson,  2020 , p. 17). Such approaches are used widely in 
policy, particularly in Europe (European Commission,  2020 ).
In terms of climate mitigation, environmental futuring has addressed the role of solar engineering, Carbon 
Capture and Storage, and green hydrogen or natural gas as a ‘bridge’ to decarbonised futures. These have proved 
influential in international negotiations (e.g. those at the Conferences of Parties relating to the United Nations FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and via the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC)), but have failed to engage wider publics in imagining what these interventions mean in practice. They 
have also, as yet, failed to provoke appropriate action from policy makers and the private sector to meet the global 
challenges faced.
The inherently normative, highly political and essentially fundamental questions regarding what kind of trans -
formed socioecological system people might wish to inhabit in the future, and importantly, how such transformations 
should occur, remain marginal in the inputs to global environmental change negotiations to date. Scenario develop -
ment, employed extensively in sustainable development and IPCC processes, is criticised for a lack of transparency, 
and an implicit normative bias towards maintaining current global economic structures. Scenarios analysing how a 
no-growth, steady state or even degrowth economy would work out for environments, social structures, economic 
prospects and community flourishing, for example, are largely absent (Spangenberg,  2019 ).
As with corporate foresight, the bulk of environmental futures work remains an elite and highly technical 
activity focused primarily on improving governance of the environment. Particular logics and assumptions under -
pin these activities, which are grounded within prevailing orthodoxies, ignoring the emergence and expansion of 
counter-movements (Kallis et  al., 2020 ) because they do not fit with pre-set, albeit often opaque, parameters for 
action. In the work of Li  (2011 , p. 57) such governing practices are seen as ‘rendering technical’ the field under 
consideration, setting boundaries and limits to action and focussing on certain characteristics (Rose,  1999 , p. 33, 
cited in Li,  2011 , p. 57). In the case of environmental futuring, this technical rendering serves to depoliticise the 
environment and obscure the uneven power relations underpinning many environmental challenges. Beyond this, 
the technical rendering of environmental problems, as in areas of community development (Ferguson,  1994 ), also 
elevates technical interventions as solutions.
2.3 | Humanity at the limen
The liminal period of global systematic transition that humanity is inhabiting, including challenging issues such as 
population growth, migration, and environmental collapse has stimulated a suite of futuring activities (Fergnani,  2019 ). 
The work within this cluster gives space to reflect on how we might transition towards and live within more sustain -
able futures. In contrast to corporate foresight exercises, these activities allow for a deeper and wider exploration of 
worldviews, cultures, and current unsustainable practices, as a means to create space for articulating and discussing 
alternative futures.
An example of such futuring includes ‘The Museum of Carbon Ruins’, an exhibition in Lund, Sweden, fiction -
ally set in 2053, where the transition to the post-fossil sociotechnical regime has already happened (Raven & 
Stripple,  2020 , p. 10). Guided by a curator, encountering around 60 objects including a frequent-flyer card and 
vintage fossil-plastic Lego, visitors are transported to a future where the transition to a post-fossil sociotechnical 
regime has already happened and future low-carbon lifestyles are normalised, while contemporary practices of 
consumption are framed as strange and unfamiliar (Ibid). Similarly, the Rough Planet Guide to Notterdam 2045, is 
conceived as a travel guide to the fictional city of Notterdam, through which the reader is brought into the future 
through narratives relating to speculative artefacts from a socially transformed future (REINVENT,  2020 ). In the 
area of food for instance, the guide contains a section on sustainable eating out tips, outlining staff writers favour -
ite food spots (REINVENT,  2020 , p. 49). In ‘Asiatown’, these include positive appraisals of ‘mystery meat’ made of 
low-carbon proteins such as jellyfish, earthworms and crickets, with lab-grown meat options available at the Dock -
lands and lab-grown salmon steak served at waterside restaurants (REINVENT,  2020 ). The guide reveals possible 
practices that could exist in a city of the future, as well as indicating the possible shape food transitions could take, 
including a predominantly vegetarian diet, organic meat production and trends towards agro-ecological methods 
(REINVENT,  2020 , pp. 14–15), as well as technological interventions such as the lab-grown meat options. The use of FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

familiar formats, such as travel guides, presents a novel means to engage wider stakeholders, and particularly publics, 
with future visions.
Focussing on sustainable energy transitions, Hajer and Pelzer  (2018 ) adopt a dramaturgical perspective of poli -
tics as performance, to develop ‘2050-An Energetic Odyssey’. This futuring exercise took place in the context of 
stalemate within talks about developing a North Sea energy collaboration and centred around an elaborate multi -
media installation, introducing large scale exploitation of the North Sea for harvesting offshore wind energy (Hajer 
& Pelzer,  2018 ). The installation took the form of an animated narrative, designed as a large floor projection and 
developed with designers and scientists with expert input from builders, offshore specialists, ministries, energy firms, 
a transmission system operator, port authorities, and environmental organisations (Sijmons & Hajer,  2019 ).
The 2050—An Energetic Odyssey is portrayed as a desirable future in which ‘the centre piece are 25,000 giant 
10 MW off shore windmills, catering for 90% of the electricity demand of the countries around the North Sea’ (Hajer 
& Pelzer,  2018 , p. 225). Similarly, in the Notterdam case the idea of lab grown meat is presented as part of the writ -
ers' eating out recommendations, framing it as a desirable practice. However, lab grown meat maintains and expands 
current industrial logics around food production. Both the lab-grown meat of Notterdam and the large-scale offshore 
wind turbines imagined within the Energetic Odyssey, are based on commercial developments in the present that 
are likely to remain privately, rather than publicly owned in the future. Indeed, in the case of the 2050 Energetic 
Odyssey the authors note that the environmental movement expressed concern that offshore wind was focused on 
dominant incumbent interests (Hajer & Pelzer,  2018 , p. 226). On the whole, such dimensions of power, ownership 
and participation in both creating and shaping the nature of imagined futures remain under examined. Indeed, the 
authors of the Odyssey exercise themselves conclude that “a plurality of futures and stakeholders remains necessary 
in the Post-Paris era” (Hajer & Pelzer,  2018 , p. 230).
Not only are diverse publics missing from the formation of future visions of humanity at the limen, within the 
majority of futuring exercises in this cluster (as with the others), such visioning tends to focus on wealthy Western 
industrialised contexts with few similar exercises conducted within the majority world (although see, Herbeck & 
Flitner,  2019 ). Even where global south contexts are considered there remain concerns around the practices of futur -
ing which retain colonial overtones and replicate many of the limitations of futuring in the Global North (Kothari & 
Wilkinson,  2010 ; Wade,  2019 ).
3 | LIMITATIONS OF FUTURING APPROACHES
A key element of concern with enacting just transitions towards more sustainable futures is that the visions which 
transitions pathways set out to achieve are themselves formulated in a just fashion (e.g. are procedurally just), that 
the distributional implications of visions are considered and that they recognise the need for restorative justice that 
seeks to rectify past injustices (Biffi & Pali,  2019 ). What the review conducted above reveals is that whilst attention 
to these three dimensions of justice, primarily through participatory futuring, namely including and tending to diverse 
perspectives and publics, is being operationalised by geographers and others (Davies,  2014a ; Davies & Doyle,  2015 ; 
Hebinck et  al., 2018 ), it is not the dominant approach. Indeed, participatory futuring is not mentioned within the 
clusters that Fergnani  (2019 ) develops and discusses.
Despite some evidence of diversification, futuring practices in toto remain dominated by elite-driven technical 
processes which tend to operate within (rather than critique) the parameters of contemporary capitalism and have a 
faith in technological fixes for problems in the present. With the exception of some recent developments within the 
humanity at the limen category described above, futures produced in this way are often constrained and abstract in 
nature, providing few opportunities for imagining what it would be like to inhabit them. Even with these novel devel -
opments diverse publics are rarely central to the formation of future visions. As a result, it is useful to consider how 
insights from research, in particular that which draws on feminist political ecology (FPE), critical agrarian and devel -
opment studies, and diverse economies approaches, might help to address these limitations and work towards more FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

inclusive, and ultimately fairer futuring activities, particularly in addressing: politics and affect; power and practice; 
and diverse values and economies. These perspectives provide important analytical leverage for asking meaningful 
questions about how futures are constructed, who is involved in constructing them and the ends to which they are 
put. Such questions are particularly important given the increasing calls for just transitions towards more sustainable 
futures.
3.1 | Politics and affect
Political ecology perspectives are particularly helpful when considering limitations in futuring around technical preoc -
cupations that dominate much futuring practice. Indeed, the predominance of seemingly apolitical techno-fixes in 
futuring, outlined previously, obscure the highly political nature of transitions which are rooted in power dynamics 
(Barry,  2014 , p. 170; Healy & Barry,  2017 ), involving processes of inclusion and exclusion. Political ecology, mean -
while, explicitly focuses on power relations in the coproduction of nature and society (Sultana,  2021 ). As such, political 
ecology is well placed to identify and critique how matters of participation and politics are manifest within futuring. 
Indeed, research using a political ecology framing has already prompted a sober questioning of the suitability and 
desirability of highly technical and commercial visions of food futures (Agyeman & McEntee,  2014 ). Moragues-Faus 
and Marsden  (2017 ), for instance, outline how political ecology allows for more critical perspectives on food, particu -
larly in understanding place-based socio-natures and the need to address the politics of scale and inequality and to 
co-produce knowledge and change.
Food futures in particular are often seen as highly technical, with Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of 
Things  envisioned as having the potential to make food production and consumption more efficient, with precision 
nutrition and alternative protein diets farmed not in a field but in a lab (Davies,  2014a ). However, many highly polit -
ical questions remain such as: Who will own the means of production? What kinds of food will be produced in these 
highly technological commercial spaces and how much will they cost? What will these developments mean in terms 
of food accessibility, given the oppressive nature of the global food regime (See Fraser,  2016 )? Such questions, bring 
attention to wider issues of access to futuring processes and distributive dimensions of the future visions created. 
It explicitly centres issues of injustices and unsustainability that are largely absent from other clusters of futuring. In 
short, by emphasising the political nature of ecological issues in the present, political ecology allows for an interroga -
tion of apparently depoliticised, but actually highly political, visions contained in futuring approaches. It elevates the 
role of values and assumptions in decision making and the central role that a politics of knowledge plays in shaping 
futures.
Within political ecology, feminist political ecology (FPE) approaches call for explicit consideration of the gendered 
nature of knowledge and questions of resource access and control (Leach,  2008 ). FPE offers further analytical lever -
age in developing a critique of dominant approaches to futuring, emphasising politics and power at different scales 
and in different places, while also highlighting gender power relations and making an explicit commitment towards 
tackling gender disadvantage and inequality (Elmhirst,  2015 ). This helps address the traditional exclusion of women, 
feminist issues and issues of particular relevance for women from futuring activities (Gunnarsson-Östling,  2011 ), as 
well as gender inequalities in sustainability transitions more broadly (Clancy & Feenstra,  2019 ).
Beyond recognising the gendered dimensions to knowledge and hence futuring, recent work in FPE, and work 
inspired by it, has highlighted the importance of emotion, affect and embodied experience (Harris,  2015 ) in shaping 
the quality of life. Yet consideration of these qualities is almost entirely missing from dominant discussions of the 
futuring explored in this paper. Feminist political ecology demands that new questions are asked about the processes 
of futuring and considerations that are deemed appropriate within them, for example: What will it feel like to live in 
these futures and what ways of being will they support?FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

3.2 | Power and practices
Challenging the predominance of Western ontologies and epistemologies, to the marginalisation of other ways of 
knowing and existing, particularly in the Global South has been a central concern of critical development (Silvey & 
Rankin,  2010 ) and critical agrarian studies (Carlisle,  2014 ). These knowledges are anchored in the experiences of 
resistance of groups that have systematically suffered injustice, oppression, and destruction caused by capitalism, 
colonialism, and patriarchy (Santos,  2018 ) and so offer alternative ways of relating to and thinking about how the 
future could be. For instance, noting the fact that the contemporary crisis is the result of deeply entrenched ways 
of being, knowing, and doing, Escobar  (2017 ) draws on ethno-territorial struggles that interrupt the global project 
of fitting all worlds into one market liberal paradigm for the transitions towards the ‘Pluriverse’, a world where many 
worlds fit. Relatedly, work on decolonising methods, inclusionary processes (Borda,  2006 ) and participatory action 
research's consideration of grassroots groups, the excluded and victims of dominant systems (Smith,  2012 ) offer 
direction here for futuring research.
Of course, not all participation is empowering (Li,  2011 ). For example, participatory rural appraisal techniques 
adopted in the 1990s by international development communities were as much about bounding the complexities 
of social life and formalising informal practices so that they can be more easily governed. Therefore, and bringing 
the focus back to futuring specifically, it is not enough simply to involve people in discussions of the future while 
leaving fundamental power relations and developmental logics intact. What is needed is to actively engage people 
in the  framing of questions to be asked about their visions for the future. This is a familiar refrain in both critical 
agrarian studies and political ecology, which have long charted the power and politics underpinning “land control, 
territorialization and extraction in the service of techno-capitalist development” (Dunlap & Jakobsen,  2020 , p. 43). To 
be a critical agrarian is not to preserve fixed social-natural ties, but rather to practice a powerfully open and dialogical 
engagement with the world and one another (Carlisle,  2014 )
As outlined in the previous section, approaches to the future of food are dominated by elite-led, technological 
visions of the future whether it be in indoor urban vertical farming growing in soil-less environments and automated 
by robots, or large scale agricultural technologies within climate-smart agriculture (e.g. The World Bank,  2019 ). These 
food futures are portrayed as offering the solution to sustainability issues, in some cases even framed as growing 
food separate from natural processes, without soil, sunlight or water (Vyawahare,  2016 ). Such visions, whilst harbour -
ing particular normative assumptions about human relationships with and to the environment, are wholly inattentive 
to the embodied nature of food and growing practices. It is assumed that people in the future will be unequivocal in 
their support of technologically-enhanced eating, something which is not borne out in literature (Davies,  2014a ). As 
with FPE, a more critical perspective gives intellectual space to ask questions about the impacts of further distancing 
people from food grown ‘in nature’, such as a further loss of spaces to practice caring around food, and to experience 
the feeling of care, of putting hands in soil, planting seeds, and experiencing the emotional and physical wellbeing of 
growing food in community with others (Dobson et  al., 2020 ; Morrow & Davies,  2022 ; Puig de la Bellacasa,  2015 ). 
Furthermore, it helps us to explore the subjectivities shaped by materialities of such techno-dominated futures. 
For instance, scholarship focused on Bangladesh and in southern Africa identify the shame, sadness or pride that 
can be connected to participation in resource management (Sultana,  2011 ; Goldin et  al., 2008 , in Harris,  2015 ). 
This research shows us that water and other resources such as food, “are not only essential for livelihoods and 
bodily health, but in fact are important to well-being and experience—including notions of exclusion and belong -
ing” (Harris,  2015 , p. 172). Mobilising poststructuralist ideas on power and subjectivity allows for more nuance in 
relation to how power and social relations of difference are constantly (re)produced in everyday interactions with 
socio-natures (Nightingale,  2006 , 2011a , 2011b , 2013 ; Sultana,  2009  in González-Hidalgo & Zografos,  2020 ). Incor -
porating these ideas into futuring activities would elevate attention to the issues of exclusion within dominant futur -
ing visions, and the need for voices and knowledges present in, but currently marginalised from, futuring practices.FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

3.3 | Diverse values and economies
Feminist economic geographers have shown that there are already existing activities which demonstrate more 
sustainable alternatives to dominant capitalocentric economic regimes (McKinnon et  al., 2018 ; Roelvink et  al., 2015 ). 
However, these activities are marginalised because they do not fixate on economic value creation in and through the 
market. In response, feminist economic geographers are seeking to expand economic vocabulary and understanding 
of exchange relations, widening the identity of the economic to include all of those practices excluded or marginal -
ised by the current reading of late capitalism. This body of work, often collated under the banner of diverse econ -
omies research (Gibson-Graham,  2006 ; McKinnon et  al., 2018 ), has also identified how considerable labour, such 
as caring duties or work within the home, is hidden from the market meaning they rarely count in decision making 
processes, particularly those which remain largely the preserve of experts and professionals such as futuring. There 
is a clear gender dimension to these debates, particularly in relation to caring economies that are often undertaken 
predominantly by women (McKinnon et  al., 2018 ). As much futures work focuses on capitalist economic relations this 
obscures and undervalues alternative economic possibilities, ignoring these kinds of activities and the livelihoods of 
those who labour in them.
Diverse economies thinking lays out a different ontological framework for thinking about economic possibilities 
(Healy,  2020 ), within which we can begin to ethically explore the choices made to perform the economy and its 
future as either a singular inevitability or a field with a variety of potentials that is open to experimentation (St. Martin 
et al., 2015 ). By revealing these possibilities, diverse economies research helps to overcome a central challenge 
identified by Hajer and Versteeg  (2019 ) in thinking of new possible worlds beyond those promoted by corporate 
futuring and focused on technological innovation. A diverse economies perspective demands that a broader range of 
options are imagined to be possible, even if they are not currently recognised as financially productive or mainstream 
activities. As others have noted, when humans imagine the future, they do so based on what they can imagine the 
world to be—so based on their current worldviews (Marshall & Connor,  2016 ). Thus, if already existing alternatives 
are left outside the frame of reference they will be ignored in the future visions created by dominant technical and 
elite narratives leading to a reproduction of the same problematic system. Creating a framework and approach for 
making visible these alternatives creates possibilities for visioning beyond the current system and identifying already 
existing meaningful and embedded solutions to social and environmental challenges.
3.4 | Towards fairer futuring
Taking a more critical stance to futuring would help to ensure greater visibility for marginalised voices and practices. 
The SHARECITY project, for instance, used participatory multistakeholder workshops and ethnographic research to 
gather overlooked insights of those involved in shared food practices including seed sharing, community gardening and 
community kitchens (Davies,  2019 ). In collaboration with an illustrator the project then developed images of possible 
future scenarios of urban food, which both platformed the marginalised perspectives of foodsharers (attending to 
politics and profiling diverse economies) as well as using visual elements such as colour scheme to communicate the 
feeling of different futures (attentive to the affective-emotive elements of such futures) (Fitzgerald & Davies,  2021 ). 
Inspired by Foucauldian interventions in futures thinking, relating to discourse and power (Wright,  2002 ), the process 
sought to make explicit political elements of possible futures in the alternative scenarios developed, but was also 
cognizant that an appearance of more democratic, participatory or progressive practice may still obscure disciplinary 
power and technologies of control (Anderson & Grinberg,  1998 ).
The complementary lenses of understanding the diverse and affectual dimensions of socio-nature experiences 
holds promise in identifying more just ways forward in addressing environmental issues. Such work—which could be 
considered as practising fairer futuring—highlights the importance of processes for achieving more sustainable futures 
and inclusive and participatory futuring approaches, recognising past injustices and seeking to make reparations for FITZGERALD AnD DAVIES

them as well as placing distributional impacts of alternative futures front and centre of debates. A fairer futuring 
research agenda would focus not only on issues of broadening participation in creating future visions (e.g. procedural 
justice), but also on patterns of uneven power within the processes of how those visions themselves are created and 
implemented. This means considering the distributed impacts they will have on society (e.g. distributional justice) 
and recognition of past inequalities as well as current uneven power relations (e.g. restorative justice). Fruitful lines 
of research lie in bringing together, and being attentive to, diverse perspectives and economic activities as well as 
providing more critical, affective and emotional insights when futuring. Geographers, drawing on insights from FPE, 
feminist economic geography and critical agrarian and development studies, are well placed to further interrogate 
the interactions between facts, values and the imagination (Hulme,  2021 ) entangled in futuring processes. This could 
open an interesting collaborative space for critical physical and human geographers, for instance to analyse the 
material impacts of climate engineering in order to interrogate the assumptions underpinning such policy discourses.
4 | CONCLUSION
How we think about, characterise and approach the future will have real-world impacts both in the present and 
near future, as well as for the broader direction of societies long-term. Distilling insights from diverse areas of geog -
raphy and relocating them into the world of futuring, as we have done in this paper, provides a useful navigational 
compass for including places and subjects previously excluded from futuring activities. This is important as geography 
matters in the interpretation and take-up of specific technical and economic logics that shape future imaginaries 
and fairer futuring would give greater opportunity for wider subjects to “resignify the spaces they inhabit” (Silvey & 
Rankin,  2010 , p. 700) and also rescript the geographies of the future. We agree with Goode and Godhe  (2017 ) that a 
more critical sphere of futuring is needed, one that acknowledges that futuring practices for sustainability transitions 
are not free from power and politics and have a duty to support matters of procedural, distributional and restorative 
justice. Geographers interested in fairer futuring should look within and also beyond the discipline, to ensure that the 
widest possible repertoire of ideas about possible futures are identified.
This paper provides a landscape view of futuring research with geographers in mind. Reviewing research and 
practice of futuring reveals a proclivity to favour technological-driven imaginaries of what could provide solutions 
to social and environmental challenges, seen manifest for instance in smart city visions (Hagbert et  al., 2020 ; Lee 
et al., 2020 ; Leszczynski,  2016 ). Such bounding in the present risks further compounding existing economic, environ -
mental and social issues into the future. In prioritising techno-driven solutions, dominant approaches to the future 
have real-world impacts, shutting down possible alternatives. Certainly, no futuring processes are neutral, all are 
based on a set of assumptions and parameters, and as such the visions they construct are positioned in relation 
to these. Creating more inclusive futuring practices and elevating marginalised perspectives in them is required to 
support the development of not only more just and sustainable futuring processes but also just outcomes.
