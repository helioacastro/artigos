ABSTRACT 
Care offers a framework to shift relations with land and suggest alterna -
tive possibilities to dominant, and often extractive, landscape practices. 
With increasing attention to inequities in labour, histories of erasure and 
exclusion, ongoing harms of colonisation, and the uneven impacts of how 
climate change reshapes landscapes, care has come to describe hopeful 
ideas for how landscapes are researched, maintained, and designed. Yet, 
care is not a simple solution to complex problems. In reviewing land -
scapes of care through politics, practices, and possibilities, we assert that 
care situated in landscape must acknowledge the relationship between 
the control of land and power, and resist paternalistic modes of care 
which normalise social and environmental injustices manifest in land -
scapes. As landscape scholars increasingly engage topics of care, we urge 
for a more critical politics of care that is reflective of how landscape rela-
tions generated through care reveal and remake relationships to power.KEYWORDS

Care offers a framework to shift relations with land and suggest alternative possibilities to 
dominant, and often extractive, landscape practices. With increasing attention to inequities in 
labour, histories of erasure and exclusion, ongoing harms of colonisation, and the uneven 
impacts of how climate change reshapes landscapes, care has come to describe hopeful possibil -
ities for how landscapes are researched, maintained, and designed. Yet, care is not a simple solu -
tion to complex problems. Care is essential to the design and maintenance of landscapes, yet 
care is often systematically devalued and erased. Likewise, care can be used to legitimise and 
extend harmful, paternalistic relationships to land, people, and place, and categories of differ -
ence shape inequities in how care is enacted (Liboiron, 2016 ; Murphy, 2015 ).

In this review essay, we argue for the radical politics and possibilities of care as affect, ethic, 
and practice in the context of landscapes. By illustrating how care alone is not a normative good 
thing but a way of thinking and acting shaped through and by specific relations (Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2017 ), we focus on how landscape relations generated through and by care remake 
relationships to power. This focus is needed as landscape scholars increasingly engage topics of 
care. Without a critical framing care risks becoming a tool of avoidance, overlooking the underly -
ing systems—thick with histories of racism, sexism, ableism, and classism—embedded in material 
landscapes and that produce the need for care. Rather, centring care in landscape studies must 
address why the need for care exists, who benefits from care, and how care reflects systemic his-
tories that produce increasingly uneven gaps in care. In this context, we build on Middleton and 
Samanani (2021 ) who suggests that without a basic understanding of what care is, who cares, 
and where care occurs, care is largely imagined only as a topic of study or as a normative ideal, 
rather than a general ethos. Yet, care is not easily defined as it is always mutually constituted: all 
relations involve care and all care creates and remakes relations. The relational implications of 
thinking and acting with care spans the material and conceptual. Care can express socio-eco -
logical interdependencies for applied landscape practices and can materially ground thinking 
within the landscape humanities.
We focus on how concepts and practices of care can inform and orient landscape studies to 
be more contextually situated. Across four sections, we situate care within landscape studies to 
better understand how thinking and acting through care ruptures and cracks the systems that 
have too often normalised social and environmental injustices through landscape. The first sec-
tion, ‘Thinking with Care’, introduces the complexity of care literature as it relates to landscape, 
positioning care as messy, life-giving, and essential. We review established literature related to 
ethics of care, with a focus on how ethics of care have arisen in response to gendered and racial -
ised labour practices that have minimised care work. Second, ‘Caring Relations’, examines how 
extensive spatial and temporal relations suggested by ethics of care arise within human geog -
raphy, environmental humanities, and landscape studies. The third section, ‘Toward Critical 
Practices of Care in the Landscape’ builds on the previous two sections to expand how care 
informs practices of landscape labour, maintenance, and design. Care always manifests differently 
and as a review essay, we are wary of focusing too heavily on empirical examples as our inten -
tion is not to provide exacting guidelines for landscapes of care. Rather, we offer vignettes of 
care practices that reflect the ideas discussed in each section. Finally, we conclude on the possi -
bilities that caring relations create by critically re-examining community and professional obliga -
tions and opportunities within landscape studies.
Thinking with care
Reflecting on the possibilities that care suggests, we are interested in how feminist, queer, anti- 
racist, anti-colonial, and anti-ableist care practices create more just land futures, or what Gilmore 
describes as ‘life-affirming relations’ (Gilmore as cited in brown, 2020 , p. 3). In this first section, 
we introduce how ideas of care have emerged in various disciplines, and trouble ‘pure’ ideas of 
care by acknowledging the socio-political structures that practices of care operate within.
Discussions of care re-emerged since 2020 in response to ongoing and intersecting crisis of 
COVID-19 and white supremacy. But, the need for care is not new, nor are overlaps of care and 
landscape. Harms caused from the lack of care, or the wrong kinds of care, ranging from climate 
change, to colonialism, to mass extinction, to militarisation, displacement, and incarceration are 
intimately shaped by and through landscape, pointing to care’s fundamental role in social repro -
duction. Landscapes are also reflective of social reproduction by ‘reinforc[ing] social relations of 
power’, and we contend that care is a fundamental component of landscapes (Blomley, 2003 , p. 
131; Watt, 2018 ). Further, as a relational ethos, care exposes how landscape and power are LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
 429
mutually constituted through the control of land. For landscapes of care to create life-affirming 
spaces aligned with movements for justice, landscape practices must take seriously the contest -
ation of land itself. Yet, with increased references to care within landscape studies, there is a 
danger of ‘carewashing’ if the complex politics that care and land involve are avoided 
(Chatzidakis, Hakim, Littler, Rottenberg, & Segal, 2020 ).
Many care scholars are hesitant to define a particular idea of care, suggesting instead that 
care can be understood through shared concepts (Collins, 2015 ; Gheaus, 2009 ; Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2017 , p. 70). For some, care might most simply be described as practices of entering 
into and sustaining caring relations (Collins, 2015 , p. 1). However, the essential work of giving 
and receiving care has long been reduced or dismissed as jobs, practices, and actions gendered 
and racialised as soft, feminised, and generally undervalued (Gilligan, 1982 ; Rose, 1983 ; Tronto, 
1993 ; Tronto & Fisher, 1990 ). In response, feminist ethics of care emerged as feminist philoso -
phers theorised how moral responsibility shaped through relationships challenged normative 
moral theory concerned with individual action (Gilligan, 1982 ). These scholars were concerned by 
the uneven distribution of gendered and racialised labour, where care work often reinscribed 
asymmetrical power relations that put care responsibilities on those with the least social power 
(Lawson, 2007 ). Held (2005 ) extended the idea of individual responsibility shaped through shared 
relations, writing that an ethic of care recognises ‘persons as interdependent rather than as inde -
pendent’, (p. 1) while others connected care with political movements towards justice through 
interpersonal solidarity (Clement, 1996 ). Productively challenging the limitations of feminist ethics 
of care, which tended to focus on the lives of white women within heteronormative domestic 
spheres, Indigenous, Black, and queer liberatory thought have practiced care as a response to 
how racial and colonial capitalism fracture relationships with land through the reproduction of 
heteropatriarchy (Tallbear, 2019 ).
Observing how care historically intersects with racism, class privilege, and colonial ambitions, 
feminist technoscience scholar Michelle Murphy (2015 ) importantly explains that care practices 
themselves create new power relations even as they work to undo others. Murphy warns against 
care being equated with positive feelings akin to political goodness, calling instead for an 
‘unsettling’ of care that is rooted in a ‘better politics of care’ (p. 719). By ‘unsettling’ care, 
Murphy stresses that care is as much about the building conditions for care as it is about dis-
mantling systems of harm, or creating the conditions in which life is precious for all, as Gilmore 
(quoted in Kushner, 2019 ) notes.
The landscape impacts of harmful care practices are well established, often failing to recog -
nise the agency of workers made invisible within structures of capitalism that demand care in 
response to state and institutional neglect or violence (Franco, 2022 ; Gilmore, 2007 ; Lawson, 
2007 ). Likewise, the material legacies of colonialism, justified by violent, paternalist notions of 
care to guise domination and control, have objectified land and water as resources and undercut 
relationships to land through property (Tallbear, 2019 ). Material engagements with landscape 
through maintenance, construction, agriculture, and ecological restoration can also obscure racial 
and economic inequities (Cephas, 2017 ; Terremoto, 2021 ) or extend ableist ideologies of social 
and environmental improvement (Clare, 2017 ; Summers, 2021 ). Oppressive forms of care-taking 
are seen in histories of landscape architecture, from the enclosure movement (Bermingham, 
1986 ), to the racialised production of parks, gardens, and environmental stewardship 
(Dumpelmann, 2022 ; Jacobs in Way et al., 2022 ), to landscape as an extension of colonial ideolo -
gies (Dang, 2021 ).
The complexity of care is also well considered in a range of disciplines that overlap with land -
scape studies. Feminist science scholars have shown how care shifts scientific inquiry from 
abstract study to a reflection of social relations (Haraway, 1988 ; Harding, 1991 ; Mol, 2008 ). 
Similarly, human geographers have considered the spatial relations produced through and by 
care by focusing on those who are cared for and those who give care (Lawson, 2007 ; Massey, 
2005 , Middleton & Samanani, 2021 ; Till, 2012 ). Within the environmental humanities, scholars 430
 S. JACOBS AND T. WIENS
have illustrated how thinking through care disrupts human exceptionalism and foregrounds mul -
tispecies entanglements (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2012 ; Tsing, Swanson, Gan, & Bubandt, 2017 ). 
Critical queer, race, and disability theorists have argued for care in shaping solidarity, mutual aid, 
and resistance to dominant systems that have either neglected to care or perpetuated harmful 
forms of care (Clare, 2017 ; hooks, 2008 ; Liboiron, 2016 ; Spade, 2020 ). Similarly, re-emergent inter -
ests in care, accompanied by narratives of ‘self-care’, expose the extent to which neoliberal polit -
ics have eroded the radical and political foundations of the care movement with individualist 
narratives (Kim & Schalk, 2021 ; Lorde, 1988 ). Across these disciplines, scholars have grappled 
with the ways unjust forms of care have been used as a method of control, assimilation, and 
erasure, along with the possibilities care suggests for life-sustaining relations outside these harm -
ful systems (Clement, 1996 , p. 2; G�omez-Barris, 2017 ; Singh, 2017 ; Tsing, 2015 ).
Despite the radical foundations of care, landscape scholarship has often engaged more sim-
ple, positive acts of care. Care within landscape practices have tended to focus on specific acts 
of maintenance (Cl�ement, Morris, & Tiberghien, 2015 ; Geffel, 2021 ; Raxworthy, 2018 ), ecological 
stewardship and conservation (Leopold, 1949 ; Musacchio, 2013 ; Nassauer, 1995 ), urbanisation 
and social justice (Morrow & Parker, 2020 ; Williams, 2017 ), cultural heritage (Lin, Martin, & Chen, 
2022 ; Milligan & Wiles, 2010 ), and care facilities, care-taking, and therapeutic gardens (Butterfield 
& Martin, 2016 ; Tsai, 2022 ). Others have attempted to bridge landscape studies with the environ -
mental humanities, or with care as a way of doing historical scholarship (Davis, 2021 ; Jacobs, 
2019 ; Meyer, 2015 ). These landscape-grounded discussions of care—while identifying essential 
aspects of landscape research—have largely focused on care as a specific topic rather than a 
socio-political ethos through which landscapes are shaped and in which care responds.
More than a mode of thought, care ethicists emphasise how caring, similar to other libera -
tory-oriented movements such as abolition, is an active, ongoing practice guided by specific obli-
gations (Gilmore, 2022 ). As philosopher Joan Tronto (1993 ) writes, care is a ‘practice rather than 
a set of rules or principles’ (p. 126), while psychologist Carol Gilligan (1982 ) notes that ethics of 
care reduce the gap between ideas and doing. Care as both an action and political affect sug-
gests how landscape is engaged in intersecting caring relations, whether it is through the land -
scape architect as participant (Franco, 2022 ; Pe~na et al., 2017 ) or landscape ecologists 
considering the ethics embedded in ecological fieldwork (Woelfle-Hazard, 2022 ).
The Providence Seed Library, a community-based project began by Fatema Maswood in 
Providence, Rhode Island is a small example of how thinking through care translates into action. 
Begun at the height of COVID-19 restrictions, the seed library works with existing community 
libraries to distribute open pollinated seeds—seeds that can be saved from one season to the 
next—that are culturally and ecologically resonate. Unlike commonly found commercial seeds, 
such as those sold in grocery stores and which emphasise uniformity, the seed library distributes 
seeds linked to culturally significant foodways or family traditions, and ones that can be planted 
and harvested year after year. For Maswood, a community member with deep personal and 
familial ties to the area, the seed library is an unglamourous but essential form of care that is 
inseparable from their sociopolitical self.
As a project that is meant to be shared, the library reflects several notions of care through 
mutuality, interdependence, and slowness. Seeds are packaged by hand, in small glassine enve -
lopes to retain vitality (Figure 1). The slow and repetitive act of packaging seeds is a communal 
activity that calls upon narrative and memory, while the sharing of knowledge between new 
growers learning about seeds for the first time and immigrant communities with deep plant 
knowledge illustrates the abundance of people who can steward and hold the project. Maswood 
describes the project as a little attempt to create a life affirming space: to seed a body of know -
ledge, and to understand seeds as living technology where the planting and growth of seeds 
create a seed bank for future generations of growers, plants, and pollinators (F. Maswood, per-
sonal communication, July 11, 2023) (Figure 2).LANDSCAPE RESEARCH

The seed library expands on Maria Puig de la Bellacasa (2012 ) claim that care is unavoidable; 
that it is always present and ‘concomitant to life’. In this sense, care is implicit to landscape as 
all relationships create care and all landscapes involve relationships. But, not all relationships can 
be defined as caring. As Puig de la Bellacasa explains, ‘even when caring is not assured by the 
people or things … in order for them to merely subsist somebody/something has (had) to be 
taking care somewhere or at some time’. Thinking with care is thus inseparable from action. But 
care is also about imagining possibilities, without idealising positive or good feelings, for life 
beyond ‘merely survivalist or instrumental’ practices (p. 198).
Caring relations
Relationality is a central idea of care that describes how the socio-ecological dimensions of land -
scape are understood through vast spatial and temporal extents (Glissant, 1997 ; Massey, 2005 ). 
The scholarship of Joan Tronto and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa in particular suggests how think -
ing through care is a relational practice, with landscape implications. Since the 1980s, Tronto has 
theorised a feminist ethics of care to challenge normative ethics centring the individual within 
moral responsibility. By examining the ways gendered labour is reproduced within domestic 
spheres, Tronto builds a robust understanding of care as a relational ethic that extends beyond 
individual agency. In their often-cited definition of care, Tronto, with Bernice Fisher, write,
we suggest that caring be viewed as a species activity that includes everything we do to maintain, 
continue, and repair our “world” so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, 
ourselves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. 
(Tronto & Fisher, 1990 , p. 40)

 S. JACOBS AND T. WIENS
Central to this idea of ‘we’ is the relational self who is connected to and shaped by other sub-
jects, spaces, and processes related to almost every aspect of life. The openness of this definition 
also suggests that care is reciprocal between people and other-than-human relations, an idea 
that Tronto more recently describes as ‘caring with’ (Tronto, 2019 , p. 29). The notion of ‘caring 
with’ explains how landscapes are co-constituted and in reciprocity with land, water, and other- 
than-human species (Haraway, 2008 , 2016 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2012 , 2017 ). The implication that 
knowing is intimately connected to a relational self suggests how care is an ongoing set of 
actions that exists alongside other-than-human material entanglements.
Puig de la Bellacasa broadens Tronto’s notion of care, challenging the anthropomorphising of 
ethical obligations and urging care thinkers to practice situated and embodied attending, a 
method Anna Tsing (2015 ) refers to as ‘arts of noticing’ or what Donna Haraway (2016 ) might 
call ‘staying with the trouble’. Puig de La Bellacasa (2015 ) illustrates through soil, for instance, 
expansive and entangled stories beyond human agency. By applying a ‘care-time’ approach, Puig

de la Bellacasa illustrates how soil refuses technoscientific logic, or solutions-based interventions 
that treat landscape as merely productive or useful, noting instead that soil is living and full of 
overlapping ecological, political, and cultural timelines that defy linear progress narratives. Puig 
de la Bellacasa explains, the ‘importance of care time means drawing attention to, and making 
time for, a range of vital practices and experiences that are discounted, or crushed, by the pro-
ductionist ethos’ (2015, p. 708). By foregrounding the work of sustaining care through material 
relations, Puig de la Bellacasa directly challenges solution-driven landscape practices that have 
relied on often-used ecological metaphors such as resiliency, novelty, or integrity to anticipate 
expected environmental outcomes.
Critiques of relying too heavily on ideals of landscape resiliency, for instance, note how resili -
ency efforts rarely ask who gains from, pays for, and ultimately benefits from actions that neces -
sitate the need for resiliency, often focusing instead on how landscapes recover from—or 
sustain—uncertain ecological disturbances (Baker, 2019 ; Fleming, 2016 ; Pellow, 2007 ). But, as 
geographer Stephanie Wakefield (2020 ) notes, the reality of creating new ecological relationships 
requires extensive amounts of work and labour—and care—by both humans and other-than- 
humans. Likewise, design projects about landscape novelty or ecological integrity often treat 
dynamic ecosystems as spaces of indeterminacy, whereby ecological processes are expected to 
reclaim or recover disturbed landscapes outside human agency. This attitude—akin to letting 
nature take over—contributes to the misrepresentation of ecosystems as ‘whole’ when human 
interventions are absent (Jacobs, 2019 ; Rohwer & Marris, 2021 ). In contrast, care challenges neo -
liberal narratives of indeterminacy that abdicate ongoing responsibility for how colonial and 
racial capitalism have created current climate crisis and species extinction. This is not to say that 
humans should assert dominance over ecological systems, a view that perpetuates a false duality 
of humans and nature, but instead advocates for staying accountable to ongoing environmental 
entanglements. Caring-with situates humans as part of nature while also acknowledging the 
need to radically change the systems that unevenly and increasingly cause human-led environ -
mental crisis.
Scholars and activists within critical queer and disability studies have similarly challenged pro-
ductionist ideas of purity within landscape restoration. Eli Clare (2017 ), for example, questions 
how ecological restoration often seeks to ‘heal’ or ‘fix’ landscapes to a so-called ‘natural’ state. 
Clare argues this attitude operates within an ‘ideology of cure’ that assumes cure is both pos-
sible and desirable. Distinguishing ‘care’ from ‘cure’ illustrates how a reliance on metaphors from 
the biophysical sciences can extend ableist ideologies of social and ecological improvement, and 
how landscape studies continue these systems of harm through design, management, and plan -
ning. Distinguishing care from cure creates possibilities—ruptures in the status quo—to imagine 
‘relationships, institutions, and actions that enhance mutuality and well-being’ beyond ideologies 
of purity and normative notions of resiliency, which too often attempt to restore false binaries of 
natural/unnatural and ignore the socio-political dimensions of environmental change. (Lawson, 
2007 , p. 1)
The Copley Community Orchard in Vancouver, British Columbia exhibits a care-time approach 
through an organic urban orchard that connects people to food, land, and each other. Planted 
in 2012 on the unceded territories of the xwmEskwEy’Em (Musqueam), Skwxw�u7mesh 
(Squamish), and sElilwEta�! (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, the one-acre orchard is filled with more than 
200 edible, native, and pollinator plants to redefine productivity in the context of community, 
education, and shared, multispecies space (Figure 3). A high sewer line runs under the land, pre-
venting it from being developed as real estate. Due to this condition, the Orchard is a unique 
example of land itself becoming a space of mutual aid, and in a city with some of the highest 
property prices in the world, the Orchard’s social value counters a productionist ethos that treats 
land as speculation. Unlike many community gardens or urban food spaces that are restricted to 
members or volunteers, the Orchard is open to all. Visitors are encouraged to pick from and give 
back to the orchard, and an extensive multi-generational and multi-lingual group of volunteers 434
 S. JACOBS AND T. WIENS
water, prune, plant, and organise neighbourhood gatherings at the Orchard. While the Orchard 
features a native wildflower meadow and various domesticated fruit trees, the space is neither 
solely about ecological remediation or agricultural productivity. Rather, the Orchard suggests 
how landscapes of care might emerge by attending to the care-time of community, vegetal, soil, 
and animal entanglements.
Similar to the care-time of soil and other materials, infrastructural care is an emerging idea 
that foregrounds the relational aspects of infrastructural building and breakdown, and impor -
tantly, how infrastructures of harm—upon breakdown—might make for something more akin to 
care (Frichot, Carbonell, Frykholm, & Karami, 2022 ). Geographer Brandi T. Summers (2021 ) consid -
ers the relationship between care, infrastructure, and racialisation through urban development. 
Studying the afterlives of parking lots as spaces of ‘clearance and control’, Summers show how 
infrastructure inscribes racial capitalism in the destruction and erasure of Black communities. 
Landscape architect Jane Hutton (2019 ) has likewise noted how the movement of materials to 
construct urban public space in North America creates reciprocal relationships with the lands 
and communities from which they are from, highlighting how production of the built environ -
ment operates within extractive economies. Geographer Kathryn Yusoff (2018 ) further challenges 
how care informs histories of infrastructure by examining how geological science is shaped by 
racialised discourses that materialise extractive economies of colonialism and enslavement.
Through the vast and messy relations that care creates, Summers, Hutton, and Yussoff high -
light the relational entanglements of care between people, water, land, and other-than-human 
life that refuse the ordering logic of extractive capitalism. By engaging in what sound geog -
rapher Anja Kanngieser and anthropologist Zoe Todd (Kanngieser & Todd, 2020 ) call ‘kin studies’, 
these examples suggest how care literature discussed in the first half this paper can work 
towards stories of care that are ‘more embedded, expansive, material, and [in] respectful

relations to people and land’ (p. 385). The care of land as a relational practice, where people and 
nature are extended ecological kin, is foundational to many Indigenous worldviews (Salm �on, 
2000 ). Drawing on these ideas of kinship, Kanngieser and Todd offer an alternative to case stud -
ies, which often depend on being abstraction from place, by rather interpreting care as specific 
obligations situated in land and community. Robin Wall Kimmerer (2013 ) suggests similar meth -
ods for understanding ecological relations through contextual, relational, and situated stories, 
while Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (2017 ) understands land itself as a teacher and storyteller. 
In the second half of this paper, we expand these ideas to focus on relations of landscape main -
tenance, labour, and the material possibilities of care.
Towards critical practices of care in the landscape
Care is incomplete without a material, relational practice. However, material landscape practices 
alone do not constitute a critical practice of care, and material engagements with landscape can 
remain dependent on the extractive labour of vulnerable groups. Maintenance is central to land -
scape practices and can take many different forms from ubiquitous ‘mow and blow’ practices to 
gardening, controlled burning, resurfacing roads, or particular harvesting methods. Many forms 
of maintenance done for landscape care—including common ‘mow and blow’ management 
practices using fossil fuels and precarious labour to maintain ecologically bereft monocrops of 
fescue—are not caring practices in an ethical or relational sense. While concepts of care apply to 
a multitude of material engagements with landscapes from agricultural practices (Di Giminiani, 
2022 ; Pettersson & Tillmar, 2022 ; Salazar, Granjou, Kearnes, Krzywoszynska, & Tironi, 2020 ), for-
estry (Grignon & Kimmerer, 2017 ; Hummel & Smith, 2017 ; Tsing, 2015 ), and ecological restoration 
and repair (Almassi, 2017 ; Clare, 2017 ; Papadopoulos, Bellacasa, & Tacchetti, 2022 ), we focus on 
the intersection of landscape maintenance and design to show how critical care can address the 
ways landscape maintenance reproduces existing power asymmetries. Attending to who has the 
power to care and who or what tends to get designated proper or improper objects of care can 
distinguish harmful or extractive landscape labour and maintenance practices from situated and 
relational landscape practices (Martin, Myers, & Viseu, 2015 ).
Thinking through care about landscape labour and maintenance is a direct extension of fem -
inist care ethics responding to the erasure of domestic work, with artist Mierle Ukeles (1969 ) 
manifesto for maintenance art titled ‘CARE’ highlighting this relationship. Landscape labourers 
face similar issues as domestic care work, such as invisibility and unequal working conditions 
within an industry that structurally devalues labour to turn a profit (Terremoto, 2021 ). In land -
scape design, valuing maintenance and repair pushes against uncaring practices of capitalist 
development that reduce land to discrete and disparate sites of construction. As media anthro -
pologist Shannon Mattern (2018 ) notes, ‘maintenance at any particular site, or on any particular 
body or object, requires the maintenance of an entire ecology’ meaning that maintenance also 
includes all the support infrastructures that enable specific maintenance practices. Interest in 
reintegrating maintenance with the practice of landscape design suggests an attempt to under -
stand how landscapes are shaped temporally within larger systems—an entire ecology—and can 
be understood as a response to the separation of the ‘professional’ from the ‘labourer’ within 
the professionalisation of landscape architecture (Davis & Oles, 2014 ; Dumpelmann, 2022 ; Franco, 
2022 ). At the same time, the economic and practical barriers that prevent integrating landscape 
maintenance and design highlights how infrastructures that prioritise construction and develop -
ment for capitalist agendas often don’t support moving beyond disciplinary boundaries. While 
landscape scholars and practitioners can’t solve this integration individually, a more critical 
engagement with the political context of maintenance practices would enrich the scholarship 
and practice in this area.436
 S. JACOBS AND T. WIENS
A framework of care has the potential to expand landscape maintenance beyond disciplinary 
boundaries, but scholars of these topics too often conflate a critical practice of care with the iso-
lated physical acts of landscape maintenance. Whether described as maintenance, stewardship, 
or gardening, authors Raxworthy (2018 ), Geffel (2021 ), Cl�ement, et. al, (2015 ), and Sutton (2022 ) 
prioritise responsive landscape maintenance that extends beyond construction and centres the 
designer as labourer, or designer as choreographer of labour. In these instances, creative or 
responsive re-imaginings of physical maintenance processes with landscape ecosystems on its 
own is an incomplete mode of care without an affective relational and ethico-political obligation 
(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ; Martin et al., 2015 ). Discussions around landscape maintenance and 
landscape design, which is still grappling with a lineage of landscape stewardship as a mechan -
ism for colonial control, would be enriched by embedding the politics of care into questions of 
how best to physically intervene in landscapes over time.
The political conditions that enable control of land—and in North America, where we write 
from, stolen land—is both a necessary precondition to designing maintenance regimes and sim-
ultaneously disregarded in discussions of landscape maintenance. For instance, the basis of Joan 
Nassauer’s (1995 ) widely cited discussion of ‘care’ in the context of ecological restoration and 
landscape design is that healthy ecosystem functions should fit into cultural expectations of 
nature in order to be successful. In acknowledging but not critiquing the ways people ‘use land -
scape to express power or wealth’, Nassauer claims care as the simple physical practice of mak -
ing the landscape ‘neat’ or attractive to a normative, white, middle-upper class, settler-colonial 
society (p. 163). In doing so, Nassauer conflates fitting into the dominant culture with affect but 
disregards the ethico-political dimension of the claims. The phrase coined by Nassauer of ‘cues 
to care’ could just as easily be reframed as ‘codes for class belonging’ (p. 167). Designing an 
‘orderly frame’, as Nassauer suggests, is by itself not a critical practice of care without also 
attending to the economic and ecological relations embedded within its maintenance practices. 
Unfortunately, many landscape scholars continue to cite this work uncritically and use it to 
advance problematic ideas of designing landscape maintenance that flatten care to an aesthetic 
exercise steeped in classist and racialised values.
Julian Raxworthy’s (2018 ) publication Overgrown unapologetically foregrounds the importance 
of time, labour, and plant growth in landscape design, protesting with careful case studies 
against the separation of ‘the gardener’ and ‘the landscape architect’. While Raxworthy briefly 
addresses the role of professionalisation in racialised labour inequities, Overgrown largely focuses 
on the work of landowner-gardeners on private property rather than marginalised gardener 
labourers, or even managers of public landscapes through government-supported or volunteer 
labour (pp. 22–23). Raxworthy acknowledges this gap,
I am focusing on the garden because it is less easily hijacked by other issues than public landscapes are. 
The garden allows a specific focus on plants. In doing so though, I acknowledge that having a garden is a 
privilege acquired through economic advantage and is not available to everyone, a fact that does 
potentially undermine some of my claims about gardening as a trade. (p. 24)
The ‘gardener’ with power to make creative decisions in response to a private landscape is 
often not the same ‘gardener’ who labours in public landscapes. French landscape architect 
Gilles Cl�ement et al. (2015 ) similarly advocates for responsive gardening-based landscape practi -
ces, but his ideas are also arranged around the figure of an individual (male) landowner 
‘gardener’. Cl�ement’s attempt to scale the idea of a ‘planetary garden’ loses impact in not 
acknowledging how capitalist and colonial access to land shapes the ability to garden for 
Cl�ement’s vision of ecological health. This way of thinking individually about land obscures what 
has generated ecological crisis and disruption of landscape processes—the need for care—to 
begin with.
Landscape designer Michael Geffel (2021 ) combines Nassauer’s ‘cues to care’ with ideas from 
Raxworthy and Cl�ement, lamenting how landscape maintenance is often misunderstood as LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
 437
‘mechanistic repetition of the same operation over and over to suppress change in the land -
scape’ (p. 3). Geffel champions creative, responsive preservation of landscape processes rather 
than landscape forms as maintenance. Geffel goes so far as to claim that ‘taking care’ and 
‘maintaining’ can be used interchangeably, which would seem to expand an idea of what land -
scape maintenance can be, but ultimately conflates care as physical maintenance. Geffel is most 
convincing when deepening the relationship between labourer, machine, and the biodiversity 
found in site-specificity. Here, learning from the larger network of relations involved, combined 
with deep and local site knowledge, could strengthen processes of landscape maintenance 
beyond the single designer-labourer-landowner.
While literature focused on the designer as maintainer has often overlooked how mainten -
ance practices uphold existing labour practices, scholarship can best uplift these efforts by taking 
on the ethico-political implications of maintenance work in landscapes. Landscape architect 
Michelle Franco (2022 ) argues emphatically for this approach, that an ethic of care for labourers 
is intrinsic to an ethic of care for the landscape, and through a genealogy of Latinx representa -
tion in landscape shows how the co-constitution of land and labour generates life-affirming care 
practices. Test Plot, a collective based on California, is another example of how maintenance can 
be situated and relational, where designers, community members, and labourers work within a 
complex network of relations. Test Plot supports localised ecologically and culturally relevant 
land stewardship at eight ‘plots’ across state and city parks that have suffered from deferred 
maintenance. The Test Plot at San Bruno Mountain in the San Francisco Bay Area highlights how 
maintenance and care align across personal, political, and ecological realms. Guided by two com -
munity members, Yoni Carnice and Chris Chou, the group organises around maintenance work 
such as planting, staking, weeding, and mulching, along with workshops on seed collection, bot-
any, local history, and story sharing about the mountain and surrounding community (Figure 4).
For Carnice, landscape care bridges the personal and the political, a practice of resistance 
against the non-situated, impersonal way of thinking he has encountered in the landscape archi -
tecture profession. Carnice is from the local community and much of his extended diasporic

Filipino family still lives there. Stories of the cultural and ecological significance of the mountain 
fill his memories; he recalls being told that the ever-present fog at the foot of San Bruno 
Mountain was steam from thousands of nearby rice cookers. The fog that is woven into the sto-
ries of the residents also feeds a particular ecotone as it condenses at the base of the mountain. 
Working with the understory of an established canopy of eucalyptus trees near a neighbourhood 
park entrance, the ‘plot’ has two purposes: first to enhance community accessibility at a non- 
vehicular entrance to the park that is most accessible to the low-income, immigrant, and diverse 
neighbourhood at the foot of the mountain, and second to experiment with what ecologically 
valuable plants can grow under the shade and allopathic condition of a eucalyptus grove 
(Figure 5). The project offers an alternative to standard ecological restoration which is more con-
cerned with ideas of purity (and often doesn’t value areas like non-native eucalyptus), and which 
usually treats ecological care as a non-social or non-cultural task. The experimental and temporal 
intentions of the project are about establishing integrated and responsive landscape care through 
ongoing attention, informed by co-constituted biotic and abiotic conditions, which in turn feeds 
and deepens relationships to land (Y. Carnice, personal communication, June 30, 2023).
Care as a practice of possibility
Throughout this essay we have not defined a ‘landscape of care’ but shown how a deeper 
understanding of the conditions that produce the need for care allows for the possibilities of 
care to emerge through a constant, situated, and collaborative process. Through surveying exist -
ing care literature and practices, we have shown how care is a practice of possibility (Hartman, 
2019 ) situated within the tension, messiness, and plurality of landscape relations. In focusing on 
the ways landscapes of care remake relations to power, we have challenged much of the ways 
care has been undertaken in landscape studies. In this brief conclusion, we consider how care 
might further inform landscape practices. The intention here is not to trivialise the urgency or 
tensions of care but to reflect on care as a practice of possibility, and to begin a conversation 
around how a radical politics of care might further guide landscape studies. That is, how does 
care create possibilities that dream and build others worlds, and that create different ways of liv-
ing together in refusal of systems that perpetuate social and ecological injustices?

Caring as slowing down, making room for pleasure, love, affect and opening oneself to the possi -
bility of being changed. The slowness and specificity of caring-with suggests how research practi -
ces might be informed by ‘acts of noticing’ (Tsing, 2015 ). To listen with care, to learn with care, 
to teach with care, to grow with care, shifts and dissolves dominant landscape narratives. The 
specificity of telling more full landscape histories (Way, 2020 ), designing landscapes through 
pleasure and slowness (Meyer, 2010 ), or the possibility created through landscape memories 
(Hartman, 2019 ) are acts of repair that allow for changed understandings of landscape. Care 
requires situated ways of knowing, creating space for reparative stories and revisionist histories.
Caring practices occur in nested scales from individual action to communities, institutions, and 
political bodies that allow for or withhold care. A critical practice of care requires an awareness 
of and attention to scale, including how care can or cannot scale, as caring-well involves the spe-
cificity of being embedded in the relations of particular places over time (Tsing, 2012 ). That care 
does not scale evenly is an aspect of the messiness of care. Yet, the non-scalability of care—its 
refusal to become abstracted or universalized—often limits the ability of landscape designers 
and scholars to translate their work across scales while also working from deep relations rooted 
in land and place that caring-with requires. Acts of un-building or de-designing harmful infra -
structure, such as designing processes of dam removal, illustrate how landscapes of care might 
engage larger scales without erasing site-specific interrelationships and reproducing unjust 
human-environment relations (B�elanger, 2020 ; Cephas, Marjanovi �c, & Milja�cki, 2022 ; Orff, 2020 ), 
while the anti-colonial alliances and solidarities suggested by Dang (2021 ) are another example 
of how care might work outside the urgency of scale.
Care can allow different ways of relating. As interests in care grow, so does the commodification 
of care, such as quantifying environmental services or carbon neutrality (Green & Lawson, 2011 ). 
Landscapes of care allow for different ways of relating outside the commodification of care, from kin-
ship as an ‘alliance with reciprocal responsibilities to one another and to our other-than-human rela-
tives with whose land, water, and animal bodies we are co-constituted’, (Tallbear, 2019 , p. 36) to 
abolition ecologies which seek to ‘recreate nature free from white supremacist logics’ (Heynen, 2016 , 
p. 842). Movements for Indigenous self-determination of life and land (Tuck & Yang, 2012 ), to Black 
Freedom Farms and other alternatives to private property (McCutcheon, 2019 ), to mutual aid (as 
opposed to self-care that extends neoliberalism) (Spade, 2020 ) suggest how care works as a libera -
tory practice to allow for systems of care rooted in generosity and abundance.
An ethos of care asks for accountability and response-ability. As Martin et al. (2015 ) notes, 
care is about ‘a willingness to respond’, and care without intention does not necessarily create 
more caring relations (p. 634). The communities that care creates should attend to how spatial 
networks of interdependence are built, how historical relationships have produced the need for 
care, and how socio-ecological accountability informs professional lives. Working from a place of 
accountability and response-ability suggests how landscape designers, students, and scholars can 
embody an ethos of care as a critical practice and critique as a careful practice.
Care is messy, but so are landscapes. Care challenges and fractures hegemonic ways of know -
ing landscape, meaning that the spaces and ways of living that emerge through an ethos of 
care remake power relations upon which existing structures of white supremacy, patriarchy, and 
exploitative capitalism depend. Invoking care without pushing against these structures merely 
remakes and maintains them. In contrast, our future depends on the removal of these intersect -
ing structures of oppression, making radical approaches to care necessary and urgent for bring -
ing futures of mutual flourishing into existence.
