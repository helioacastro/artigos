Temporality ABSTRACT  
Socially assistive robots in eldercare settings, i.e. ‘social ’ robots, are currently being promoted and studied, 
particularly in Japan. Among these studies, clinical evaluation of their effectiveness in experimental research 
predominates, while studies that critically and analytically describe relations between actors in long-term care 
settings where robots are present are growing but still scarce. In this paper, we argue that understanding how 
older adults facing the loss of autonomy and their caregivers interact with robots in relational terms is helpful to 
explain the usage and non-usage of, and eventual resistance to social robots entering into care settings. This is 
why, in order to understand human relationships with social robots in elder care homes, this paper combines a 
‘script ’ approach and a ‘critical care’ one. Based on content analysis of a unique set of reports on trials of a social 
robot in multiple care facilities in Japan from 2018 to 2020, as well as interviews with stakeholders and 
ethnographic observations conducted in 2022, we answer two questions: 1) how do social robots shape social 
relations of care? 2) how do social robots affect social relations between care professionals, care recipients and 
robots? We proceed to discuss two of the characteristics emphasised in the ethics of care and examine them in 
depth: the positional and temporal aspects. Our major result is that, while the robot was easily adaptable to care 
environments because its position in relationships is not defined, embedded clock time flow in the robot was 
objective and linear, which indicates that some robot-created situations were seen as problematic by actors in 
care settings.   
Statement of ethical approval: The ethics evaluation committee of 
Inserm, the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute of medical 
research and Health, gave ethical approval for this study (22–918).

In the context of increasing life expectancy, the growing number of 
older adults (OA) with cognitive impairment, as well as the scarcity of 
caregivers, are increasingly recognised as a serious, worldwide public 
concern, especially in industrialised countries [1]. There is rising opti-
mism that technology will play a role in addressing these issues and the 
effects of technology as well as robots on OA is an increasingly important 
theme in geriatrics and gerontology. Some ‘social ’ robots, such as ani-
maloid robots, are deemed to have the potential to complement or 
replace pet therapy, a non-medical treatment of dementia care that the 
Alzheimer ’s Association in the United States recommends [2].1 
In Japan, since 2015, the government ’s ‘Society 5.0’ science and 
technology policy strategy has suggested that technology, including big

meanings of each term: ‘social ’ and ‘robot ’ [77].

2data and artificial intelligence, may well tackle the medical and care 
difficulties of OA with cognitive impairment [3,4].2 Over the past 
twenty years, Japanese society has seen increasingly rapid advances in 
service robots and communication robots, contributing to the idea that 
Japan is a world leader in the development of robotic technologies for 
OA [5]. However, despite government initiatives and positive effects on 
OA reported in research, robots have not proven to be widely employed, 
at least in long-term care facilities (LTCF) [6].3 
In this context, most studies in the field of geriatrics and gerontology 
have focused on the effectiveness of robots on difficulties that OA face 
[7–10]. Many of these studies have demonstrated the positive impact of 
robots mainly on OA but also on caregivers, at the level of individuals 
[11]. However, research so far has failed to resolve an important 
paradox: whilst studies demonstrate a relatively high effectiveness of 
robots, there remains a low rate of robot adoption in care settings. To 
date, there has been little agreement on what role robots can play in care 
settings. In particular, what is not yet clear is the impact on or the 
transformations of care relations at the level of social groups [11], in 
other words, caregivers and care receivers. This is because previous 
studies did not properly take into account the perspective of a politics of 
care as referring to both the act and relationship of arising survival needs 
and responding to them in a particular context and situation [12]. Care 
practices always involve at least two people: the person needing care (or 
to whom needs are attributed) and the person responding to them [13]. 
Our study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by 
addressing this gap in the literature, by focusing on relationships be-
tween care recipients, caregivers, and robots. This paper seeks to 
examine neglected aspects of relationality and explores, in particular, 
the position-related connectedness and the time-related connectedness 
between these actors in the care setting by highlighting the position, 
role/function differences of [14,15] and the tempo/rhythm differences 
of people and things [16]. Taking ‘social’ robots as a focal point 
throughout the paper and assuming that the inclusion of social robots 
influences relations in long-term care practices, we explore the two 
following research questions: ‘how do social robots shape social re-
lations of care?’ and ‘how do social robots affect social relations between 
care professionals, care recipients and robots?’. The first research 
question focuses on the way the robot develops and fosters close re-
lationships between actors in the care setting, while the second sheds 
light on the effects of these relationships on care practices. We empha -
size the relational nature of care in this paper since care is frequently 
thought of as an act, yet care can only occur between two entities: one 
that has needs and another that responds to those needs. The two 
questions are closely connected, with the second being a direct 
follow-up to the first main question. To investigate care practices 
involving social robots, we draw on the notion of ‘script’ [17–19], 
because, as evidenced by Science and Technology Studies (STS), it is 
particularly significant for assessing the relationship between humans 
and technologies without separating them and modifying the lexicon for 
each. 
Our empirical strategy is to try to answer these questions by focusing 
on a case study of social robot trials in Japanese care settings. More 
precisely, the research data in this paper is drawn from three main 
sources; two-year trial reports obtained from a robot provider; semi- 
structured interviews with robot providers; and participant observa -
tion of trials conducted in LTCF. 
This paper begins by introducing our theoretical approach. Then, it 
dwells on our data and methodology. It is followed by our key findings, 
which are organised according to the relationships as in the design and the relationships developed throughout the trial. Finally, in the discus -
sion, in order to understand the actors’ relationality in care settings, 
these findings are analysed through the notions of positionality and 
temporality. 
2.Theoretical background 
To investigate the use of technology in eldercare, two different ap-
proaches have been primarily adopted. The majority of studies have 
been quantitative and are essentially based on clinical, laboratory, or 
experimental investigations that study how technology might be used to 
solve problematic conditions such as social isolation [20–22], poor 
well-being [23–25] and depression [26]. For example, studies on ther-
apeutic companion robots have found a rise in the frequency of inter-
action among older persons at the micro level [27,28]. The perceptions 
and the acceptability of OA and caregivers were also explored [29,30] 
and it has been shown that perspectives among them have recently 
shifted to the positive, with stronger hopes for telecare robotisation and 
fewer concerns about care robots’ compatibility with personal values 
[31]. These studies see technology as an interventionist solution [32,33] 
and investigate human-robot relationships at the individual level [11].4 
In contrast, there is a growing body of literature that draws on STS in-
sights and the majority of investigations have been empirical and 
observational in nature, including ethnographic inquiries into eldercare 
contexts [34,35]. Several studies have demonstrated the diversity of 
technology usage (and non-use) with respect to how one engages with 
and through technologies according to one’s assumptions as well as 
expectations [36,37]. They investigated the complex arrangement of 
technologies, care professionals, and care recipients, contributing to the 
accumulation of empirical data on technology use in relational terms 
[38–40]. 
Publications that concentrate on studying actors and their relation -
ship with and through technologies tend to adopt a ‘script’ approach. 
Possibly because if the relationship between caretakers, care recipients, 
and technology is considered, each arrangement using technical 
equipment requires distinct inspection in order to learn the forms of 
social relations it delivers [41]. The notion of ‘script’ [17–19] offers a 
fundamental methodological concept that helps explore and understand 
the relationality of actors and non-human actors, including technolo -
gies. Being an important and heuristic idea in social studies on the 
relationship between technology and people in the context of care [38, 
39,42–44], script is similar to a screenplay for a film or a play: the 
relationship between technology and people can be analysed like a 
script, a connection between technology and people envisioned by the 
designer. Because technology is usually intended bearing human 
behaviour in mind, the script framework can also provide insights into 
the designers’ social values and norms. According to a detailed summary 
provided by Akrich and Latour (17), this concept is based on the lin-
guistic notions of ‘performance’ (the operation of using language) and 
‘competence’ (the ability to conform to grammatical rules). It asserts 
that competence and performance are endowed and distributed to 
knowledge and artefacts, i.e. science and technology, and a crisis or a 
trial can reveal the envisioned, prescribed functions of technologies. The 
authors clarify the difference between the two by explaining that action 
itself is ‘defined by a list of performances through trials; from these 
performances are deduced a set of competencies with which the actant is 
endowed’ [18]. They argue that scripts portray actors (or ‘actants’) and 
their behaviour as envisioned by the innovators’ side and that 
comparing performance to scripts through actual conflicts, confronta -
tions, and problematic situations is relevant in studying socio-technical 
relations. 
There is a growing number of studies which use STS insights and 2 See Ref. [78] for a discussion on the use of social robots from a policy 
standpoint.  
3 It is important to highlight that, unlike the healthcare sector, other sectors 
have seen an upward trend in robot use, as evidenced by international research 
on delivery robots [79] and advising robots [80]. 4 For more studies on ethical concerns with socially assistive robots, see 
Ref. [81]. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier

3describe the roles that technologies can play within these networks of 
people and objects in care settings. Winance studied disabled persons in 
the process of trying and selecting wheelchairs [45,46]. She analysed 
relations between the disabled person and the wheelchair in their 
context and implied that care entails adjusting the interaction and 
balancing the positions of each member of the collective, which has led 
to her proposition that care is shared work. Similarly, Pols and Moser 
[47] investigated technologies for OA in need of care and looked into the 
social ties forged between them, by targeting relevant representations 
such as the coldness of technology and the warmth of care as the 
research object. They have shown that technology is not necessarily 
always cold and that some OA felt warmth from and affection for 
technology, particularly social robots. Together, these studies, by chal-
lenging the idea of humans and non-humans in the different realms of 
existence in the way Latour did [48], show that the heterogeneous 
character of relationality plays an important role in understanding 
technologies in social settings. 
However, recent studies have not been able to account for all aspects 
of relationality in care involving technologies. Considering care as ‘an 
affective state, a material vital doing, and an ethico-political obligation’ 
[49], this study adopts a ‘critical care’ approach to study technology 
[50,51], by examining ordinary and often neglected aspects of the re-
lationships such as positional and temporal aspects of the care rela-
tionship from the perspective of a politics of care [52].5 Positional 
characteristics of the care relationship have been studied [12,14,15] to 
explain how a symbolic power asymmetry might arise between those 
who need care and those who provide care. This positional asymmetry is 
regarded as unavoidable in the practice of care since individuals who 
respond to needs frequently have the option of whether or not to 
respond to those needs, whereas those who require care frequently do 
not, according to Sen’s capacity perspective [53,54]. The temporal 
component of care practice is seen as one of the most pressing challenges 
in care practice. The reason for this is that care practice lasts (and it 
should be) as long as the person in need is satisfied, whereas, in group 
care, activities such as eating, bathing, and some recreational activities 
are completed on a tight timetable, resulting in relative temporal ten-
sions [16]. In a ‘critical care’ approach, the ’affective state’ of care can 
be investigated by the positional aspects of the relationships, while ’the 
material vital doing’ of care may be examined by taking account of the 
temporal aspects of the relationships. Therefore, these two aspects 
cannot be overlooked and are deemed heuristic for exploring the rela-
tionship with and through robots.6 
There are inspiring research examples in the field of social studies of 
science and technology that scrutinise care practices through a critical 
lens. Even though social robots show a certain degree of effectiveness in 
solving individual problems such as depression, interactions between 
humans and robots may yield some unexpected situations, resulting in 
some resistance to technologies. For example, ethnographic work in 
Japan provides evidence that this is because proponents of the tech-
nology, including the government, anticipate robots to be omnipotent, 
yet users in care settings perceive different realities of care from those of 
the proponents and become even antagonistic to robots [55]. A socio -
logical work in France reveals that this is because, in the precisely 
located practice of care, robots do not always behave as expected, and 
both care recipients and carers must exert significant effort to engage in 
exchanges with the robot [56]. Overall, these studies highlight the need 
for empirical knowledge to demonstrate the ambivalence of deploying 
robots in care settings and a more nuanced discussion of what technologies can do in social life. 
3.Data and methodology 
We began by evaluating two-year reports on a small humanoid robot 
trial drafted by a staff member of the digital promotion department in a 
large for-profit Japanese telecommunication company. The reports were 
obtained from the staff member during the time we carried out partic -
ipatory observation of the usage and non-usage of robots in LTCF in the 
Kanto region from April to July 2022. Contact with the robot provider 
was made through an online visiting tour of LTCF that introduced caring 
equipment and robots, organised in October 2021 as one of the public 
initiatives undertaken by the Department of Social Welfare in the same 
region. The aim of the document, according to the promotion staff 
member, was to report the free trials of the robot to the head robot 
development management team, and its production was a requirement 
for acquiring a robot and implementing free trials for sales promotion: 
there was no ‘checking or amendment of the report’. The opportunity to 
have access to this information was highly valuable, and although such 
procedures may be difficult to replicate in the future, it would be unwise 
to dismiss such reports without considering them as an insightful source 
of material. Besides, through the digital promotion staff member, we 
obtained robot promotional material (one confidential, digital presen -
tation material and one publicly available, printed material) and also 
consulted the robot overview website and the robot instruction manual 
website (which are both publicly available). 
Trials were conducted before the pandemic, between April 2018 and 
March 2020, at 13 different facilities (9 day-service centres, 1 special 
care home, 1 geriatric health facility, 1 fee-based care home and 1 de-
mentia group home). A single trial session was held at 11 different fa-
cilities (8 outpatient day long-term cares, an LTCF, a group home for the

4OA with dementia and a fee-based LTCF), 27 sessions at an outpatient 
day long-term care, and 13 at a long-term care health facility (see 
Table 1). The 50-page reports included practical descriptions such as 
operational details of an approximately 1-h trial session and reactions of 
the prospective users, as well as the digital promotion staff member’s 
thoughts (i.e. positive and negative judgements). The content was not a 
formal report, but more of a memo-like record of the staff member’s own 
struggles and mistakes. These records were processed by qualitative 
content analysis and the corresponding code names were used for quo-
tations from the reports (institution code followed by report element 
code). It should be noted that by the time this report was finished, none 
of the LTCFs had adopted the robot. No change has taken place as of the 
time of writing of this paper. 
To supplement this data, two semi-structured interviews were con-
ducted: one with the digital promotion staff member who granted access 
to the reports and the other with two of the robot’s designers. The in-
terviews took place in May 2020 and lasted 60 min. Since the robot 
promotion company (Kanagawa, Japan) and the robot design company 
(Osaka, Japan) are different entities, interviews with the former were 
conducted in the author’s office (Tokyo, Japan) and with the latter via 
video call. 
Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and converted to textual data. 
A grounded theory approach [57] was used for these textual data as well 
as for two-year trial reports to conduct inductive data analysis in order 
for themes to emerge from the data. In other words, the analysis was 
carried out using a form of thematic coding to classify and categorise the 
data. 
In addition, to supplement the trial reports with triangulation forms, 
participant observations were conducted at sites where the robot was 
introduced with the help of the digital promotion staff member from 
April to July 2022. Four stints of participant observation were con-
ducted, totalling 6 h in length. Two of them were performed at the 
mentioned facilities in the reports: the day-service centre and the geri-
atric health facility. We conducted the observation in the presence of the 
digital promotion staff member. During observation, we had informal 
conversations with care workers about the adoption of a robot but did 
not manage to gather from care recipients their perceptions of the 
interaction with robots. The authors translated trial reports, interview 
transcription and fieldnotes from Japanese to English. 
In order to use the company’s internal reports as research material, it 
was necessary to anonymise the robot, the digital promotion staff 
member and long-term care facilities. Thus, publications cannot be 
directly cited or referred to, though summaries will be provided. The 
names of the robot, Kuro and of the promotion staff member, Ken, are 
pseudonyms. All quoted statements were accompanied by their 
sources.7 
4.Findings 
4.1. Relationship between robots and care actors, ‘prescribed’ in the 
design 
The robot is intended to help care professionals with light exercise 
and recreational activities and must be connected to the Internet, a set- 
top box, and a TV screen that displays activity materials such as still 
images and recorded video. In the robot’s ‘script’, the aims of encour -
aging a group of care service users (usually at least four or more) to 
conduct light physical activities and mental activities were transcribed 
into the robot’s action such as gesticulating, talking loudly and shifting 
attention in various directions. In particular, Kuro is configured to utter 
words in line with the participant’s feelings, such as ‘it feels good,’ or 
words that are concerned about the participant’s burden, such as ‘it’s indeed difficult’ [the printed material]. As stated in the ‘script’, this 
might be required in order to ‘realise a completely new, people-centred 
communication service’ [the robotic company website]. 
Two significant themes emerged from the data on the robot sup-
plier’s side. First, from the robotic company’s online materials, it is 
apparent that technologies, in their own right, provide possible answers 
to societal problems. The robot Kuro, a ‘table-top size’ that ‘enables 
natural dialogue using words, gestures, and hand gestures’, was 
designed with the goal of ‘realising a society where people and robots 
can fully coexist’ [the robotic company’s website], which is essentially 
identical to the strategy outlined in the Japanese government’s 5th Basic 
Plan, dubbed Society 5.0 [3]. The script here projects that robots may 
behave and act like persons to assist in resolving interpersonal problems. 
Furthermore, as the following interview with a robot designer demon -
strates, efforts and research have been carried out with the assumption 
that robots will be a tool that can be used in care settings, in other words, 
they can play an active role. In the interview, the robot designer said: 
(My company and the company under the same group as the com-
pany Ken works for) initially started a joint research project to 
investigate whether it (a robot) could be used in the field of care and 
developed the robot and its additional application service dedicated 
to assisting with recreational activities in LTCF. [interview] 
The script here shows the environment where the robot is assumed to 
behave as an autonomous entity. The script portrays an ideal relation -
ship in which the human gets assistance from the robot, but it does not 
cover, for example, the relationship in which the human prepares the 
robot for operation or sets the robot’s surroundings, which will be dis-
cussed later. A human-robot social bond envisioned in the script is one 
where the robot can act autonomously and assist the human in any 
environment. 
The second type of relationship in the script is focused on the 
implementation of a collective endeavour such as recreation or reha-
bilitation. It is of a type that disregards the conditions of implementa -
tion, particularly the situation of the participants. Strong evidence of the 
assumption of the habitual, if not mechanical, nature of recreational 
time in institutional eldercare was found when the script emphasises the 
robot’s automated process of interaction with humans. It is clear from 
the following excerpt that recreation is envisioned in the scripts as a 
unilateral action by the recreation executor. Data from the printed 
promotional brochure show that: 
(Kuro will) automatically conduct these [recreational] activities (in 
care settings) by employing incorporated cameras, microphones, 
speakers, and networking functions, as well as being highly inte-
grated with IoT devices, cloud AI, and other devices. The service 
content includes exercise sessions, brain training, music, reminis -
cences, and games. [printed material] 
Certainly, the use of robot-assisted recreation has a relatively posi-
tive impact on recreation participants. This is clear from an ’improve -
ment in the residents’ positive attitude towards interaction with others’, 
according to findings of an empirical test conducted by a university 
professor [confidential digital material]. This is also supported by 
another trial, conducted from August to October 2015 by the company, 
which have brought about some positive evaluations of the robot from 
prospective users of 12 care professionals, resulting in three trans -
formations in actual scenes of care: 
reducing the burden (of recreational activity preparation) (for care 
professionals), helping to solve the care staff shortage (for care fa-
cility directors), and improving satisfaction (for care recipients). 
[printed material] 
However, in a setting where robots perform these recreational ac-
tivities ’alone’ and ’automatically’, by ‘taking the place of staff’ 
[confidential digital material], it is assumed that recreation is a routine, 
an act that is repeated in institutional care, without taking into account 7 A swift check was conducted, and no robot named Kuro was identified, 
therefore any reference to a robot called Kuro is accidental. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier

participant of the recreational activities. Only the person in charge of 
delivering the recreation is present in the script, rendering residents 
somewhat invisible. 
4.2. Partial ‘performance ’ of the script in care setting: limitations 
‘described ’ throughout the trial 
4.2.1. Harmonious but distant relation between the robot and recreation 
participants 
The theme of harmony and a sense of unity recurred in Ken’s report 
and one element to establish harmonious relations was Kuro ’s sound. 
This sense of unity might be simple to form, but it was evident from the 
reports that it was also easy to be disturbed, depending on the vocal 
sound of the ones who are spearheading the construction of together -
ness. In two reports (trials done in April and May 2018), care pro-
fessionals mentioned problems with Kuro ’s voice and associated 
television sounds which were too low to convey messages as issues to 
solve. 
It would be better if it [Kuro] were mobile, because [as it is] it would 
only reach about 10 participants around it. Because there are 20–30 
people, in the day service [it] is difficult to implement [it]. Is it 
possible to use multiple robots at once? DS03-F38 
The sound volume/range is difficult to hear low volume DS03-F39. 
Can it be used in multiple locations? TY01-F02 
These points highlight how difficult it is for humans to adapt to the 
low volume of the robot, particularly in spaces where large groups of 
people spend time together, such as care settings. It also emphasises how 
difficult it is for a robot to adapt to humans because it requires additional 
equipment (for example speakers, as Ken recognised [DS01-F15]) and 
must overcome numerous obstacles, such as material connections, as 
discussed later. Taken together, even something as trivial as the volume 
of a machine appears to play a vital impact in the development of 
pleasant interactions that foster harmonious relations and a sense of 
togetherness, in institutional eldercare. 
Indifference, then, can be viewed as a detriment to establishing a 
sense of unity. Ken was particularly interested in the robot ’s failure to 
conduct the recreational activities according to the programme and 
generate a ‘harmonious relationship ’ between the participants, that is, a 
condition in which the participants perform the activities to the same 
degree. There were situations among the participants without excite -
ment or indication of heightened mood and the word ‘indifferently ’ was 
often used in Ken’s reports [DS01-F12, DS03-E21, F23, F24, E35, DS04- 
F56, GH-E73, D79]: 
If (we) do not get a good start, a rec [ recreational activity] is done 
indifferently. DS03F28 
This usage underlines the fact that it was regarded as beneficial to do 
activities together, with everyone who shared Kuro ’s presence partici -
pating. Furthermore, indifference can cause some people to become 
detached from recreational time, bringing about a discordant state in the 
room. Ken wrote down situations where no prospective users, especially 
no resident, responded in their interaction with Kuro. Ken was keenly 
aware of the reactions of those around Kuro, as well as no reactions of 
them which was deemed undesirable by Ken. This implies that partici -
pating in recreational activities indifferently, such as when each person 
behaves independently or does not respond to any proposed movement, 
is deemed to limit the synchronisation of each participant ’s activity that 
encourages togetherness and constitutes detached and distant relations.

tomatic (service users of dementia). DS04-F49 
(There are) three people who appear to have dementia, one of whom 
is irritated by her leg pain, are unresponsive. YRH-F154 In establishing connections among seemingly indifferent partici -
pants, the gaze of Kuro and of the residents was also decisive during the 
observation. Kuro tried to engage in recreational activities in the same 
way that a care professional would , by looking around at the people who 
were closer to it. This was possible because Kuro was outfitted with a 
camera and speakers, which allowed it to perceive the current situation 
around it in a similar way that human eyes and ears do. The following is 
an excerpt from the field notes during participant observations in April 
2022. 
Kuro, connected via a wireless connection to the TV screen, gave the 
impression that it was paying attention to its surroundings by turning 
its head to participants, in line with what a human instructor on a TV 
screen was performing. [field notes] 
It was apparent from the observation that although Kuro tried to look 
at the people around it, the participants did not always look at the robot 
or make eye contact with it and the majority of the participants ’ eyes 
were, in fact, placed on the TV screen rather than the robot.8 The gaze of 
Kuro was not met by the participants ’ gaze, which was difficult to 
describe as an interactional, reciprocal, bi-directional gaze. It was un-
clear whether this was due to the small size of the robot or the fact that 
the explanations of the exercises to be performed were provided by the 
video on the TV screen. 
4.2.2. Pleasant but one-way communication between the robot and care 
recipients 
The theme of detachment was also found during the observation. 
Certainly, some phrases mentioned above were heard from Kuro and 
they were unquestionably meant to share emotions and make the robot 
more pleasant and approachable. Nonetheless, neither OA facing the 
loss of autonomy nor care professionals responded to the words Kuro 
uttered. The following is an excerpt from the field notes during the 
participant observation. 
To get the rhythm going, the robot said ‘one, two, one, two’. Because 
no one is speaking, its somewhat high-pitched, infantile voice stands 
out in the room. [field notes] 
One reason for this may be that Kuro ’s facial expressions remained 
unchanged even when Kuro expressed emotions verbally. Kuro was 
described in the promotional material as accompanying the recreational 
activities through voice and words, but because of its one-way 
communication, it was unclear how much the prospective users would 
perceive that they were being accompanied (either by someone or by 
something). 
Ordinary conversations are frequently limited in group care facilities 
among residents or between residents and care professionals, as in 
hospitals and clinics. The following quotations from the reports show 
expectations around the role robots play in communication. Ken even 
hoped that Kuro ’s utterances would spark a conversation. It is apparent 
from these quotations that, if communication is viewed as a means of 
expressing emotions and relating to each other, an instrument expand -
ing communication options is hoped for. 
Next time, too, [if we can have] enough time for conversation, [it] 
will make it [Kuro] more approachable DS03-G30 
Kuro needs to be able to move around and interact with each person, 
and everyone should be encouraged to respond during the rec [rec-
reational activities] DS04-D42 
Instead of Kuro indifferently presenting and answering questions, 
[Kuro] should be used as a starting point for establishing a dialogue 
(for example, what does this Chinese character mean? Tuna is the

actual body and hand gestures. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier

6answer. Do you enjoy tuna? Do you like sushi? Do you enjoy fishing? 
[We should] enjoy various conversations while making the most of 
the internet. DS04- D56, 
F56 
Spoken exchanges are usually based on verbal and mutual relations. 
However, according to the report as well as the participant observation, 
the robot struggled to establish them with humans. Both Ken and pro-
spective users believed that a conversation with Kuro, which is claimed 
to be a communication robot, would be effortless, probably considering 
the ’prescribed’ relations outlined in 4.1. A situation was documented in 
which a care professional as a prospective user cited the difficulty of 
holding a conversation as one of the barriers to adopting Kuro, which 
was also understood and shared by Ken. 
The conversation [with Kuro] was not smooth; when users spoke 
directly to Kuro, it did not receive an answer, and the dialogue was 
conducted through the robot operator [Ken]. 
[Ken’s response] As previously stated, Kuro found it difficult to 
respond humanly, and it usually responds when the eyes are blue; 
improvements are planned in the near future to enable seamless 
dialogue. DS04-F609 
This quotation illustrates that the difficulty of establishing verbal 
and reciprocal relations between the robot and the human lies in the fact 
that the human must speak when Kuro’s eyes are blue and modify his or 
her way of talking in order for the robot to understand. The distinction 
between such an attentional person and a person who requires long-term 
care is significant because the latter frequently has communication 
difficulties, particularly verbal communication due to hearing impair -
ment. Since it was impossible for the robot to be adapted to the inter-
locutor, it was nearly impossible for the robot to become an interlocutor. 
The robot sought out familiar and everyday talks with residents, but 
instead, there was one-way engagement from either side. 
4.2.3. Mechanical and functional connections between the robot and care 
professionals 
One of the mechanical aspects of robots that automate recreational 
activities is that they follow a programme, making it almost impossible 
for them to adapt to the target audience. The duration of physical and 
cognitive activity for each resident is highlighted as problematic in the 
reports. 
The following report quote from Ken’s point of view in May 2018 
refers to how long people need to practise physical exercises. 
[What we accomplished] was not merely a video recreation, but a 
trial of Kuro’s presence (Kuro’s unique expression and space, as well 
as its realization). However, continuing for more than 30 minutes 
may be exhausting … DS03-F27 
In addition, not taking into consideration the rhythm of a person’s 
movement was also a concern. Both Kuro (with its dedicated service to 
OA facing the loss of autonomy) and the instructor on the TV screen 
were supposed to target them in LTCF, but there were still participants 
who moved their bodies at a different, slower pace than the robot and 
the instructor. Ken wrote in the report in replying to a care professional’s 
comments on the difficultness of the exercises in the recreation: 
(A)s long as we take into account previous trials, people with de-
mentia cannot keep up with the exercises; it would be beneficial if 
the pace of the exercises could be slowed. DS04-F64 
Robots are frequently connected to a variety of other technological 
objects. Although they can perform multiple roles and simulate human 
behaviour, they need physical and technical connections to function. These links are usually established in material terms, yet they are often 
considered problematic in specific situations. 
While in most care settings, wheelchairs, walkers, and canes are 
widespread, technical objects that consume energy and must be 
recharged do not prevail, even though power plugs and cords are 
commonplace in our daily activities as a result of technological 
advancement and diffusion (such as personal mobile phones). Japanese 
eldercare homes usually have at least one large-screen TV for enter -
tainment, but adopting some other technical device such as a robot 
appears quite a different matter and tricky. It is apparent from the 
observation that the placement of a robot could affect care relationships 
in which people go often from place to place, probably because a robot 
could be placed in the middle of the space while a TV set usually cannot. 
In the trial report, a care facility employee raised the following questions 
after trial sessions carried out in March 2019. 
The power outlet is in the way, and the feet [of caregivers] could get 
mixed up with it, so it would be better if we could move the robot 
using storage batteries (similar views were expressed at other facil-
ities). DS08–23, F23 
Technical issues, which may be considered minor in the first step, 
can be perceived as a serious problem. When the person in charge of 
caregiving breaks off the relationship with the person in need of care and 
begins preparing to use the technology, it has an impact on the operation 
of activities in care homes, particularly when bathing, eating, and other 
activities take place at set times. Trial reports in June 2018 and January 
2019 clearly showed the reasons for the difficulty of adopting the robot 
in a day-service centre. 
The time it took to start the rec [recreational activities], the impact 
on work, and the fact that care is [provided] in time slots, and rec 
[recreational activities], meals, bathing, and so on [are] arranged, so 
the inability [for the robot] to start on time is a concern. DS-04, F58 
(Kuro’s) recreation was occasionally cancelled because images could 
not be displayed on a TV set (it [the TV] has an HDMI port, but data 
distribution was not possible) DS06-F132. 
5.Discussion 
So far, we have displayed findings organised according to the re-
lationships ‘prescribed’ in the design and ‘described’ throughout the 
trial, through the methodological concept of ‘script’ [17–19]. As 
mentioned in the theoretical background, relationality, in particular 
positional asymmetry and temporal tensions, are crucial themes in the 
studies of robots that adopt a ‘critical care’ approach [12,49,52]. Based 
on this, the following section addresses the initial research questions, i.e. 
how social robots shape social relations of care and how social robots 
affect social relations between care professionals, care recipients and 
robots, by focusing on positional and temporal aspects of the 
relationships. 
5.1. Relationship through positional aspects 
First, this study showed that the robot’s script included establishing 
interactions in care settings as a dialogue partner and a mood enhancer 
to create a harmonious relationship and a sense of unity. Even though 
the robot also unintentionally produced distance which was considered 
uncomfortable by Ken, care recipients as well as care professionals 
seemed to embrace the robot as a partner. A possible explanation for this 
might be that recreational time in institutional care is related to the 
notion of ‘activity’ and ‘participation’ rather than ‘body function and 
structure’ as the health condition suggested in the International Classi -
fication of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by World Health 
Organization [58]. This is in line with Pols and Moser’s findings that 
older people sometimes have positive feelings towards robots [47]. The 
observed non-refusal of both the caregiver and the care recipient may be 9 Ken said in the interview in May 2022 that no improvement were 
implemented. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Technology in Society 77 (2024) 102559
7accounted for by the symbolic positional asymmetry that inevitably 
exists between caregivers and care recipients, as noted by care ethicists 
[59], because accepting the robot as a partner may reduce the degree of 
positional asymmetry for both parties by placing them in the same po-
sition relative to the robot. 
A second important finding is that everyone in the scene, including 
residents and caregivers, was paying attention to the robot. Although 
positioned as an assistant to the instructor on the TV screen, Kuro, as a 
knowledgeable actor, takes a central rather than peripheral position 
during light exercise. The nature of knowledge ranged from cognitive 
quizzes or physical exercises, popular songs of yore, to historical events 
(such as the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) that many people were familiar 
with. This encyclopaedic knowledge favoured the robot’s central posi-
tion as a mood enhancer, maybe leading to peaceful and pleasant re-
lationships with actors in the scene of eldercare facilities. 
At first glance, the presence of this apparent ‘helpful’ robot to 
conduct collective activities seems to contradict Weber’s study [60], 
which states that robots are usually designed to look helpless so that 
they are easily accepted. Even though the robot does not look like one of 
those artefacts ‘which are gender-stereotyped as helpless women’ [60], 
this robot indeed looks somewhat ‘helpless’. While this robot looks 
genderless like some models shown by Schiebinger et al. [61], it seems 
to have been inspired by an infant because of its small size and its 
high-pitched voice. The present study went a step further, revealing that, 
despite its rather ‘helpless’ appearance, a helpful presence was assumed 
given how the robot was used and therefore when the robot was placed 
in front of the group of residents and care professionals, it became the 
participants’ focal point. Care ethicists have recognised a similar posi-
tional asymmetry that can be explained by placing the care receiver and 
carer in a position that is either symbolically inferior or superior, with 
the former frequently in a dependent state [59]. It should be highlighted 
that our study has identified the symbolic and actual positions of the 
centre and the peripheral, with the former, the robot in our study, 
frequently drawing attention from the latter. 
5.2. Relationship in temporal aspects, focusing on activities 
The study found that the robot established a one-directional rela-
tionship with care recipients by not adapting the duration and speed of 
the exercises to the OA, causing problematic situations. Besides, the 
robot’s script brought about functional relations with care professionals 
and the robot preparations such as the robot’s material connections also 
raised issues by influencing the time flow of the LTCF. The findings 
confirm that providing care is first of all extremely context-dependent 
activity [62–64]. Both problematic situations might not have been 
viewed as such if the robot had gathered information about its own 
context, specifically for whom [65] or where and with whom it was 
doing what [66], rather than just acting on its own, based on its pro-
gramme. It is all the more striking given that the definition of a robot 
often refers to an intelligent mechanical system ‘with three technologies: 
a sensor, an intelligence/control system, and a driving system’ [67], and 
robots can be ‘viewed as socially helpful machines with three functions 
of ‘feeling, thinking, and moving’’ respectively [68]. 
These situations considered problematic support the view that the 
time running through care practices is primarily subjective in nature and 
cannot be measured, rather than objective time flow that can be 
measured [16,55,69]. This is especially because OA in need of care in 
LTCF can also be seen as an entity that, depending on the situation, can 
experience a potentially very destabilising physical and cognitive con-
dition, at a great, particular pace [70,71]. Thus, the reason why the 
former situation of the robot’s inability to adapt was deemed problem -
atic may be explained by the fact that the temporal dimension of the 
robot dialogue was firmly based on objective and linear time. It was 
difficult for the robot to reply depending on the time it takes for each 
resident who could sometimes go through several phases of communi -
cation. Of course, the robot might also foster this type of interaction through what Davis refers to as ‘process time,’ [16] or ‘kairological’ 
time, a temporal aspect that is emphasised in care practices [69]. 
Certainly, it is indeed possible for the robot to encourage the person to 
spend less linear, more subjective time flow, as evidenced by the finding 
where participants not only listened to Kuro’s chat about their youth but 
also were prompted to engage in conversation around it, seemingly 
losing track of time via the act of reminiscence. Kuro’s programmed chat 
lasted only a few minutes, but the dialogues leading up to the narrative 
of each participant began suddenly and were terminated somehow, with 
no one noticing how long it lasted. Despite this, it should be noted that 
the robot simply produced the ‘trigger’ that gave rise to the relationship 
through process time, and the robot played a minor role on its own in 
this relationship. This conflictual temporalities between the robot’s 
linear and regular rhythm and the residents’ personal rhythm seem to be 
consistent with the idea of the difficulties in ‘temporal alignment’ [50] 
in socio-technical innovation and the idea of which rhythms adjust to 
which (and whose rhythms to whose) [72]. 
Furthermore, this study showed another nature of time in institu -
tional care that flows through the rigorous schedule of carrying out 
various, often physical, activities as suggested by the idea of measurable 
and objective time flow in collective care [16,55].10 The second condi -
tion of insufficient preparation for the robot was deemed problematic 
probably because the time required to make the robot perform consisted 
of, paradoxically, not straightforward, clear-cut time but compound 
process time. This seems especially true for care professionals, because 
of several back-and-forth steps to follow, which disrupted the linear time 
of institutional care practice composed of several varied process time 
related to each care act. One might propose that if there were no issues 
with the robot’s preparation, there would exist a certain affinity in terms 
of time flow between institutional long-term care considered routine and 
the robot’s operations. However, this would be possible on the condition 
that someone among care actors is ready to prepare, arrange and 
manage the connection with the robot or to materially ‘take care of’ 
robots [56,73], so that these actions do not conflict with the relationship 
with the care receiver established in the process time. 
5.3. Social relations and practices of care, affected by social robots, from 
positional and temporal aspects 
Even though these findings may be underpinned by the (constructed) 
robot-friendly nature of Japanese culture [74] and therefore require 
careful interpretation, it can be deduced from this that robots develop 
relationships through positional and temporal elements of the re-
lationships (Fig. 1). On the one hand, the robot was configured to 
alternate between standing in the centre and aiming for an equal posi-
tion as a dialogue partner. The robot was not designed to be placed in a 
clear, observable position in a relationship. It was ‘inscribed’ into the 
robot to build a relationship by freely adjusting the robot’s position 
physically and symbolically. 
On the other hand, it was also in the robot’s script to develop re-
lationships in the execution of recreation and communication activities 
through a relatively fast pace and regular rhythm. Certainly, the robot 
was configured to occasionally provide some opportunities to create 
social bonds between care professionals and care recipients through 
slow and leisurely moments. However, the robot rarely generated 
connectedness through the subjective and unpredictable rhythm in the 
recreational activities aimed at meeting the residents’ socio- 
psychological requirements. 
It may come as a surprise that when care professionals were to set up 
the robot for its function, they were unable to do so in a smooth time 
10 This is also consistent with the view that modern labour stresses measurable 
time and that such time is a central indicator of productivity that links labour 
(action) and workers (people), with productivity being the dominant argument 
for technology inclusion in care settings [85]. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Technology in Society 77 (2024) 102559
8flow, and therefore constant and regular temporal elements in the re-
lationships between the robot and the care professional were not 
observed. However, in this situation, the robot occupied the position of 
being ’cared for’ by the care professionals, establishing a relationship 
with numerous stages of adjusting, connecting and modifying. This 
seemed to necessitate almost a course of action for the care professional, 
who currently lacks specialised expertise and experiential knowledge 
compared to robot providers, meaning less linear time flow but more 
processual time flow. Because an artefact ’s processual preparation time 
was only marginally associated with one fragment of care procedures, 
care professionals were unable to make room for it among other process 
time flow of personal physical care especially. Although care practices 
are already ‘problematic because it involves social interactions that 
contain the potential for conflict ’ [75], this care arrangement with the 
robot produced even more conflictual time flow in collective eldercare, 
due to the excessively steady rhythm of the activity and the irregular and 
unfamiliar time flow of the robot ’s maintenance. 
Based on these findings, it seems obvious that the robot ’s incorpo -
ration into care settings has caused even more difficulties in the tem-
poral aspects of the relationships. As a result, it is possible to hypothesise 
that the conditions for a robot ’s admission into this seemingly 
straightforward but entangled care environment include not only 
considering the relationality of care but also a malleable positional 
relationship and a less observable and less predictable temporal 
relationship. 
6.Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper was to contribute to the ongoing research 
field on the use of socially assistive robots in eldercare settings. We have 
argued that it is fruitful to look at the relationships between OA, their 
caregivers and robots, by contrast to studies that focus on the individual scale. In order to understand human relationships with social robots in 
eldercare homes, we have combined a ‘script ’ approach and a ‘critical 
care’ one. Based on content analysis of a unique set of reports on trials of 
a social robot in multiple care facilities in Japan from 2018 to 2020, as 
well as interviews with stakeholders and ethnographic observations 
conducted in 2022, we have tried to answer two questions: 1) how do 
social robots shape social relations of care? 2) how do social robots affect 
social relations between care professionals, care recipients and robots? 
By analysing relationships ‘prescribed ’ in the design and ‘described ’ 
throughout the trial and emphasising the positional and temporal as-
pects of the care relation, we have obtained the following major result: 
while robots are easier to adjust in terms of positionality because their 
position is not defined, embedded clock time flow in the robot was 
objective and linear, indicating that it was difficult to adjust in terms of 
temporality. 
However, the findings in this study are subject to some limitations. 
First, the current study has mainly tackled the positional and temporal 
aspects of the relationships focused on the robot, instead of care service 
providers or recipients via the robot. It can only be speculated that, as 
we briefly mentioned in the Discussion section, the robot ’s intervention 
in conversation engagement may have sometimes increased the sense of 
togetherness and solidarity in less asymmetrical relationships between 
care providers and recipients as well as in less objective time flow. 
Second, we have not sufficiently examined how power relation and 
position are related to temporality in the case of technologies, as studies 
in other settings identified the link between the temporal character of 
actions and power in relationships [76].11 Third, given that care is a 
selective form of attention, we could have addressed whether the social

11One classic study examining people in dominant positions and their tem-
poralities is that of Bourdieu [86]. Y. Tamaki Welply and S. Lechevalier

9relations enacted by the robot cause some people or things to be 
excluded [34,52], and if so, who and what things are excluded. Still, this 
paper did not have the space to explore this topic. 
Examining positional and temporal aspects of the relationships be-
tween OA in need of care, their care provider, and the robot will help 
identify the nature of their relationship and how it is affected by the 
inclusion of robots. This should help to explain why robots are often 
regarded favourably in studies at individual levels but not rated as such 
at the level of social groups, in this case, care setting actors. A future 
study investigating the interaction between OA in need of care and ro-
bots striving to care, by considering these actors as relational entities 
and focusing on their positionality and temporality in relationships, 
would be insightful to explain the underutilization of, and consequent 
resistance, to technologies.
