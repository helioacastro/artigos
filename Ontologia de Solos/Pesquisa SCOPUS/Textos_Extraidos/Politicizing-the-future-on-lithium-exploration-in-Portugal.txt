Politicizing the future: on lithium exploration 
in Portugal
Emília Araújo1*  , Sofia Bento2 and Marcia Silva1 
Abstract 
This text explores the meaning of the expression “mined future,” which has been used by local populations who 
oppose lithium production in Northern Portugal. We argue that the expression encapsulates the existence of a con-
flict for the “ownership” of future, unfolding a battle of visions of the future between local populations and govern-
ments. The local population sees the exploitation of lithium as a takeover of future. In contrast, the governments 
justify the project by promising a sociotechnical future in convergence with European green energy rhetoric. This arti-
cle follows a grounded theory approach. It relies on information collected about the lithium exploration in Portugal, 
mainly through journalistic pieces and opinion articles disseminated between 2019 and 2020. In particular, the paper 
proposes that political action that involves large sociotechnical ventures with the potential of contamination needs to 
consider the local collective perceptions of the future.

This article aims to reflect on the confrontation of tem -
poral perspectives, which are part of the debate about 
lithium mining in the North of Portugal. The purpose 
is to unravel the opposing visions of the future from 
the perspectives of local population, government and 
the extractive industry and to capture the sense of the 
expression “mined future. ” The local populations and 
other organizations and movements use this expression 
to demarcate their position against the venture. We aim 
to show that perspectives about the future are as critical 
as a spatial landscape in planning significant disruptive 
sociotechnical developments that impact communities 
and territories. On the line with Levenda and Richter [1], 
we aim to stress that politics, and especially science and 
technology policies, need to consider different percep -
tions and experiences of future, and better correspond to 
population aspirations, when taking decisions that affect 
time perspectives.The policy agenda for green energy in Portugal and 
Europe is underway, thereby generating a vast diversity of 
sociotechnical imaginaries [2]. Jasanoff and Simmet’s [3] 
define imaginaries as “collectively realized, institutionally 
stabilized and publicly held visions of desirable futures, 
animated by shared understandings of attainable forms 
of social life and social order and supporting advances in 
science and technology” (p. 120). Unlike other sociotech -
nical objects, lithium is concentrated in soils. Its extrac -
tion demands a complex process that inevitably alters 
the landscape. For this and other reasons, it is a source 
of great controversy in health and environmental studies, 
which point out its potential adverse effects, as Shahzad 
et al. state [4]. In fact, Kszos and Stewart [5], Qin et al. 
[6], and Oliveira [7] say that among the main conse -
quences of mining are dust clouds and water pollution, 
which significantly impact agriculture, food, and health.
Javiera Barandiarán [8] explains that governments 
need to legitimize political programs based on science 
and technologies. Therefore, new totalizing imaginar -
ies around the undertakings can emerge, bringing about 
disputes and debates about time ahead. Despite sev -
eral discourses around the path toward green energy Open AccessEuropean Journal

expenditure, it is usually the proximity (or anticipated 
proximity) to potential adverse impacts that explain 
how the local population receive and react to techni -
cal undertakings. For example, Eaton et  al. ([9], p. 227) 
stress the role of “social movements that coalesce around 
competing for collective memories of place. ” As stated, 
and aligned with Hajer and Pelzer [10], we argue that the 
implementation of undertakings requires rethinking the 
political use of future.
Indeed, in the case of lithium mining in the North of 
Portugal, the expression “mined futures” has gained 
momentum to mark how the local population has 
understood the disruptive effects of lithium exploita -
tion on what they consider to be “their” future. The 
expression, identified in the media, positions the local 
population’s perspective on the project. It also trans -
lates the discontent at a national and international level 
through the mobilization of international organizations, 
such as UNESCO and recourse to various widely rec -
ognized newspapers and TV Channels in Portugal and 
abroad. Notwithstanding such discontent, EU policy 
and the national government have continued to take an 
interest in the project, stating that job growth and eco -
nomic dynamism outweigh the potential environmental 
impacts.
In line with what STS researchers have proposed for sev -
eral other areas in Europe and in the world [10], lithium 
in Portugal is part of a broad political project for energy 
transition and the development of the electric car indus -
try, which is currently underway and full of controversies. 
Most of the areas targeted for lithium exploitation are 
located in low population density regions in the Northern 
and Center-East areas of the country (Serra d’Arga, Barro/
Alvão, Seixo/Vieira, Almendra, Barca Dalva/Canhão, 
Argemela, Guarda, Segura e Maçoeira). The geological 
surveys carried out over the last 10 years had the support 
of national governments and the EU, who considered the 
added value lithium would represent for fostering energy 
transition, as exemplified in the document “Competitive -
ness of Portuguese Lithium” [11, 12]. In the media, there 
has been much discussion about the topic, involving 
politicians, the local population, specific NGOs (such as 
QUERCUS), and other organizations that are opposed to 
or intend to monitor the process, such as Miningwatch 
[13]. Politically and economically, the process is ongoing, 
and new plans for creating industries for lithium conver -
sion associated with traditional oil companies [14] were 
made public in 2022 [15, 16], when infrastructures began 
to be built, particularly in the Montalegre region (in the 
Northern part of the country).
This paper draws on data collected until the end of 
2021. It is based on a grounded theory approach [17], and 
closely follows the theoretical and critical alignment of authors on the sociotechnical and politicized visions of 
the future presented by Aykut [11], Kropp and Scheele 
[15], Chateau et  al. [18], and Marquardt and Delina 
[19]. It discusses the hypothesis that the exploitation of 
lithium is anticipated as has having effects on the com -
munities’ timescapes forever, fueling the emergence of 
pessimistic expectations: fear of the extraction impacts, 
and fear of regions and landscapes structural reconfigu -
rations on time ahead.
Building on the visions of D’Angelo and Pijpers [20], 
our paper develops two leading structural discursive 
positions:
i) Lithium exploitation is a sociotechnical phenomenon 
which constitutes one of the main axes of energy 
transition supported by sociotechnical imaginaries 
which become embedded in politics;
ii) Lithium exploitation imposes critical questions about 
how to deal with the effects brought by the temporal -
ities of contamination to regions and places and their 
imagined and desirable futures.
The article’s title intends to show how this temporal 
horizon is the locus of confrontation between different 
ways of valuing, experiencing, and perceiving the time 
ahead (of individuals, communities, and the country). 
Thus, the text follows a comprehensive methodological 
path inspired by the grounded theory approach aligned 
with Charmaz’s [17] interpretative approach. Finally, the 
article suggests that policy should reflect on the future, 
avoid single narratives, and instead deploy the future’s 
diversity.
We divide the paper into three main sections. The first 
presents a methodological note that clarifies the infor -
mation used throughout the article and its implications. 
The second makes a short systematization of the object 
of study. Next, it is proposed a problematization focus -
ing on the concept of the future and on its relations with 
sociotechnical imaginaries. Then, we make the presen -
tation of a primary empirical evidence that anchors the 
conclusions into the need to include the future as a spe -
cific object of political action for large sociotechnical 
infrastructures.
Methodological note
The paper has an exploratory character that consid -
ers the principles of a grounded theory approach in 
line with Charmaz [17], based on Glaser and Strauss 
[21]. As said, it aims to contribute to a theory of time 
and temporality on lithium. This purpose fosters the 
understanding of lithium as a sociotechnical phenom -
enon underpinned by the idea that the researcher is 
able “to give meaning to data, understand what the 
Page 3 of 11
 Araújo et al. European Journal of Futures Research           (2022) 10:23 
 
data says, ” as argued by Noble and Mitchell ([22], p. 
1). In other words, we aim to “observe and describe” 
[14] the lithium exploration process by analyzing the 
sequence of events with expression in the public space. 
These events include political decision-making and the 
opposition movement from the populations and local 
governments.
As Venturini points out [23], the analysis of technologi -
cal controversies deploys a diversity of voices, arguments, 
and places where discussions take place. In this case, we 
use various content published by different media from 
when the first lithium exploration plans became public 
until 2021 when we started writing this article. In addi -
tion, we draw on an essential official policy paper that 
expresses policy options and legitimation processes for 
lithium exploitation as a way for Portugal to respond to 
the demands of the energy transition. We also consider 
Portuguese radio, television and press, as well as sev -
eral international media, including Euronews, for they 
stand out for how they have dedicated themselves to the 
subject. Taking a documental perspective, they reveal 
political positions from the government, ministries and 
the main Portuguese parties, and live aspects of resi -
dent populations. On the one hand, media sources such 
as TV and the press constitute traceable sources of the 
conflict that are easily accessible for a researcher; on the 
other hand, they make it possible to retrace the situations 
where actors disagree and thus map the plurality of con -
flicting pieces. Moreover, they enable observation of how 
collective life at specific moments is represented and cir -
culates through the public space, enabling support for a 
theoretical perspective on the role and status of time and 
temporality.
Two types of text anchor the analysis: (i) policy dis -
courses provided by public statements made by govern -
ment and public institutions, and (ii) direct excerpts 
of comments made by residents of the targeted areas, 
experts, and visitors, reproduced in several media. The 
database is built on articles from the following newspa -
pers online: Público, Jornal de Notícias, Sol, Económico, 
Correio de Manhã, Observador, the New York Times, 
Sábado, Daily News and The Guardian; press agencies: 
Reuters and Lusa ; the magazine: National Geographic; 
radio stations: TSF Radio Notícias and Radio Renascença; 
and the television channel: Euronews. The database cov -
ered the period of controversy over the last 2 years, from 
2019 to 2021. We searched with the expression “Lithium 
Portugal” (in Portuguese). We collected 78 news items, 
of which 17 were from 2019, 7 from 2020 and 54 from 
2021, when the mobilization of local governments and 
populations intensified. The visibility of the controversy 
in national and international media, the circulation of the 
chosen media, their sizeable political scope, and the ease of access through the digital archives of these newspapers 
were the main criteria used to select the materials.
In summary, given the embryonic state of knowledge 
about the process, the aim here is to provide a snapshot 
of the lithium controversy, focusing on temporal dimen -
sions, thus uncovering imaginaries of the future within 
this new possibility of lithium mining. The longitudinal 
data collection, despite exploratory, allows us to map 
the various entities and actors that appear in the contro -
versy and inspect the events not in a sequential line but 
through semantic bridges established between them. 
The analysis of the themes follows the main criterion of 
grounded theory and not that of categorical discourse 
analysis with universal categories. Hence, we analyzed 
each article independently and built unique sheets of the 
themes treated in each piece, aligned with Jacobsen [24].
Theoretical context of the problem
Sircova et al. [25] asserts that time perspectives are ante -
cedents and consequences of societal sustainability and 
growth. Koselleck [26] clarifies that experience shapes 
temporal expectations and visions of the future, under -
stood as a “description of what could occur in the near-
term, mid-term, or long-term future. While shaped by 
ideological constraints, visions reveal alternative narra -
tives or futures, thus inviting contestation within them -
selves, and between alternative perspectives” ([2], p. 645). 
These respond to the abilities that social actors believe 
they have to face any kind of event that suggests change 
or rupture. Thus, temporal disruption becomes even 
more intense when the introduction of large sociotech -
nical ventures comes accompanied by visual changes 
in landscapes and entails effects perceived as harmful, 
implicit and uncertain, both on human groups and the 
natural world: land, air, and water.
According to Sorokin and Merton [27], a relationship 
continues insofar as there is an agreement between the 
parties involved regarding its “socially expected dura -
tion. ” In this case, the relationship between local popu -
lations, governments, and companies is uncertain in the 
case of developments requiring extraction from the soils. 
It leaves room for mistrust on the part of the population 
because no one can provide certainty about the poten -
tial effects of the exploitation on the community and the 
environment, not even the law, since the consequences 
may be invisible and difficult to relate to the interven -
tion actions required in the present [27–29]. This is the 
case of contamination—primary source of uncertainty 
and threat [30, 31]. As Fent and Kojola propose, “many 
of the resulting damage of contamination are latent from 
the outset and develop over a long period without being 
detected” ([ 32], p. 44). Analyzing the effects of techno -
scientific development, Martins [33] warns of the need 
Page 4 of 11 Araújo et al. European Journal of Futures Research           (2022) 10:23 
to take precautions against long-term effects and forms 
of contamination. Contamination refers to a continuous 
process. It opens up an endless temporality, mainly made 
via technological objects and waste. Studies on water 
contamination stemming from industrial and techno -
logical development, for example, attest to this timeless 
nature of the contamination, showing that, after contami -
nation, it becomes practically impossible to determine 
for how long water remains unusable for drinking, irriga -
tion, and bathing [34]. Nature and society are intrinsically 
related to each other. Science tells that contamination 
affects the temporalities of natural resources, especially 
the soil, in unnoticeable, albeit irreversible ways. It also 
affects the temporal prospects of communities and their 
inhabitants. As a result, it can trigger massive move -
ments of exodus and abandonment.
In addition, sociotechnical imaginaries have a solid 
capacity to persuade. For example, the existence of energy 
sources [10] emerges within a “green energy” rhetoric 
through which governments and industries are portrayed 
as makers of the future. This institutional power is perva -
sive and can bind social actors’ visions, demanding their 
adhesion.
Marquardt and Delina [19] highlight the importance of 
“investigating the power relations behind emergencies or 
calls for urgent policies” (p. 4). Indeed, following Jasanoff  
and Simmet [3], sociotechnical ventures may be putting 
at risk the imaginary of local needs in favor of the global 
imaginary of future renewable energy and innovation. In 
other words, in the wake of Hajer and Pelzer [10], we can 
say that futures that impose themselves as hegemonic 
and undisputed visions present themselves as extremely 
attractive and persuasive, shaping individual negotia -
tions, decisions and practices [28, 35]. Ultimately, they 
are self-explanatory, disregarding experience, knowledge, 
and personal and social aspirations, as Marquardt and 
Delina argue [19]. In this way, the normative and critical 
view argues that these sociotechnical can be integrated 
into desirable futures, rather than being planned futures 
[3, 9, 36], which seem predetermined by economic or 
technological needs, says Kelz [37].
Jasanoff and Simmet emphasize that in processes of 
“discovery” or “rediscovery” of economically valuable 
minerals underground, the inhabitants may witness an 
invasion of outsiders [3] who are usually organized in 
“power constellations. ” Following Aykut [11], these pro -
cesses are incredibly typical in the area of energy due to 
the easy association between energy transition and the 
idea of an open future, full of possibilities driven by sci -
entific and technical progress, following Shahzad [4], 
Hagerstrand [38], and Knappe and Schmidt [39].
Hence, the politicization of the future can take vari -
ous forms, depending on the types of actors, interests, and objectives in question [37, 39]. Based on this theo -
retical position, we argue that plans and projects aimed 
at extracting natural resources from territories affect 
both the temporal perspectives of the population and 
that of the natural resources themselves, such as soil, 
water, and air, in a continuous, persistent, and perennial 
way, and also disrupts the expectation of the future as 
stable [40, 41].
Appadurai [42] argues that the “future is a cultural 
fact. ” We are going through moments characterized by 
a remarkable “(re-)politicization, ” says Kelz [37]. That 
is why literature emphasizes that politics must take 
the future as a central conceptual and methodologi -
cal concern, as problematized by Kenis and E. Mathijs 
[43]. Therefore, we also suggest normatively combining 
community aspirations with economic development is 
necessary because anticipating the future is not error-
free. It is, thus, essential to act with caution in a con -
structive and shared way about the “desirable future” 
(see Jasanoff and Simmet [3 ], Eaton et al. [9 ], Bai et al. 
[36]).
Understanding the “mined future”
Oomen et  al. [44] state that imagined (sociotechnical) 
futures are socially performative. We will deepen the con -
troversy about the future by taking into consideration the 
information gathered around two discursive positions:
i) Exploitation of lithium is one of the main hallmarks 
of the energy transition and it is associated with dif -
ferent sociotechnical imaginaries.
ii) Lithium mining imposes critical questions concern -
ing the ways to deal with the effects brought about 
by the temporalities of contamination to regions and 
places, as reports Sanchez-Lopez [45].
The problematization presented above anchors one 
central idea: there is a need to reflect in the way politics 
envisions sociotechnical undertakings and values meth -
odologies for constructing scenarios and visions of the 
future.
Discursive positions
Discursive position 1: lithium and the sociotechnical 
imaginary of the energy transition As Aykut notes 
[11], “the effects of predictions and scenarios depend on 
the uses that actors make of them, the practices associ -
ated with them and the political struggles in which they 
are embedded” (p. 120). In the case of lithium mining 
in Portugal, we can also propose that the sociotechnical 
imaginary of Portugal buoys these debates as a modern -
ized country capable of contributing to the imagined 
Page 5 of 11
 Araújo et al. European Journal of Futures Research           (2022) 10:23 
 
European energy future while fueling increased invest -
ment in economic rewards, job creation, and regional 
development.
Lithium mining operations came to Portugal following 
extensive exploration for the mineral worldwide. The 
sector is seen by politicians and some energy experts 
mainly for its “potential” to contribute to a desire for self-
sufficiency, in a scenario where lithium batteries are the 
“Batteries of the future, ” and “Iberia” will perhaps be the 
land of this new future [46]. When the first evidence of 
the discovery of large lithium deposits in Portugal was 
released in 2017, some of the political elite and private 
sector celebrated with great enthusiasm, presenting the 
discovery as a path to a different future. In the media, the 
first news in 2019, lithium is perceived mainly based on 
its positive potential and wealth that can be generalized 
for the future. This idea of the future is expressed with 
a particular assumption of its role in energy production 
and economic development. It is presented as something 
that requires a “race, ” a certain “speed” to take advan -
tage of the “abundance. ” A “treasure” and “millions” are 
expected to come from the “lithium potential, ” that is to 
say, from the “white gold” or the “oil of the future” [47]: 
“Lisbon’s actions will also have repercussions beyond its 
borders. Its reserves may be modest compared to Aus -
tralia and Chile, the world’s top lithium producers, but Portugal is central to Europe’s bid to cut reliance on lith -
ium imports” [48] (Table 1).
According to Smallman, “the machinery of government 
shapes how public perspectives can be heard and accom -
modated in policy” ([49], p. 14). As the political discourse 
unfolded in Portugal, it connected lithium to the future of 
Portugal assuming that it contributes directly to potenti -
ating the “green energy. ” The words used in this narrative 
point to this meaning. It is said that “Portugal is among 
the countries with great potential in the extraction of this 
ore” [50]. They point to Portugal’s contribution to pro -
ducing the “oil of the future. ” The international discourse, 
especially in the context of the European Union, shows 
this dazzle and reinforces the sociotechnical perspective 
of the future. A research article published by Reuters [51] 
even classifies Portugal as the “poorest country in West -
ern Europe, ” that now has a “bright future” due to its abil -
ity to “exploit” the precious metal for batteries. The EC’s 
political representatives maintain the same narrative that 
the Portuguese government espouses.
In March 2021, Euronews broadcast a report stating, 
“One of the keys to unlocking Europe’s energy transition 
to carbon neutrality is hidden in the mountains of north -
ern Portugal. The region is rich in lithium, an essential 
component for the growing electric vehicle sector” [31].

energy transition, which is committed to the widespread 
use of lithium batteries. Portugal is referenced as a coun -
try with the technical and logistical capacity to contrib -
ute to this effort. Further on, it states that “Lisbon’s action 
will also have repercussions beyond its borders” and 
that “Portugal is central to Europe’s attempt to reduce 
dependence on lithium imports” [48].
This narrative highlights Portugal’s lithium wealth and 
the opportunity to use the metal to promote “neutral” 
energy. Thus, keeping alive the dream of “being a Euro -
pean, and perhaps world power” ([37], p. 4), the political 
investments were supported by several reports contain -
ing information on the existence of lithium in northern 
Portugal and the interest in its exploitation.
Throughout this process, there is a gamble on the tem -
porality of convergence with European interests and with 
the idea of modernization, supporting approaches that 
ensure the reduction of the risk of contamination because 
“the extraction methods use the most modern technolo -
gies” , and there is a chance, say the Portuguese represent -
atives, to count on “highly efficient recycling processes 
and technologies, aiming at the maximum recovery of 
batteries and components, to allow the reduction of EU 
dependence on raw materials and circular economy in 
Europe” ([37], p. 6).
There were several demonstrations of resistance and cau -
tion from environmentalists and academics concerned 
about the certainty of the need for lithium. A representa -
tive of the environmental movement, Quercus, asked a 
fundamental question about contamination [52] “Lithium 
is necessary, but then what will be done with these bat -
teries and how will this lithium be transformed?” Other 
voices entered the conversation, bringing into the debate 
the uncertainty around contamination: “Our very exist -
ence implies pollution, and no green energy is truly clean 
because of the materials needed to obtain it through dirty 
processes. But that can’t be free for everyone. That needs 
to be controlled” [53].
Nevertheless, the arguments made by politicians 
remained firm, with one promise made: in its revised the 
Circular Economy Action Plan, the European Commis -
sion is clear: we need to boost the circular potential of all 
batteries, namely by modernizing the Batteries Directive, 
establishing rules to ensure: (1) all batteries are produced 
sustainably—low resource consumption, little waste gen -
erated, easy repurpose, disassembly, and recycle; (2) rules 
on recycled content, measures to improve collection and 
recycling rates, and ensure recovery of materials; (3) any batteries used in the growing market for EV are sustain -
able ([37], p. 7).
The immediacy of the project took over the political dis -
course, which reacted against more resistant positions, 
particularly those established by academics such as geol -
ogists [54]. Nevertheless, the government affirmed future 
safety. They say that “the European rules are clear: who -
ever takes responsibility for a certain area must guarantee 
that the environmental impact is reduced, compensated 
for and therefore there is a whole range of European 
legislation that frames these mines” (Portuguese com -
missioner) [55]. Thus, the future is portrait as “an inevi -
table path, ” embodied in the “twenty-first-century gold. ” 
Lithium is emphasized as a solution, capable of shaping 
the future. In this sense, political and media discourses 
emphasize the imaginaries that invoke lithium as a “fable” 
of decarbonization, as the “fuel of Europe’s electric vehi -
cle revolution” [56].
In line with our first idea, this short version of the story 
illustrates the duration of the trajectory of lithium’s dis -
covery in northern Portugal’s territories. It also discloses 
the definition of a political agenda for its exploration 
and commercialization in Portugal. When, in 2017, the 
news reached the public space, local communities were 
surprised. The moment was marked by a discourse that 
carved an open temporality, with the future offering dif -
ferent choices and alternatives.
Lithium exploration in Portugal is still a project (poten -
tia). As we have pointed out, this perspective of an open 
future, typical of societies which value science and tech -
nology, is marked by an emphasis on the possibility that 
the exploitation of lithium facilitates the imaginary of 
convergence with Europe in areas associated with the 
development and an increase in options (scientific and 
technological) to conquer the future. However, as the 
vision of a “bright future” spreads into the public space at 
the hands of politicians, industrial companies, and some 
experts in the field, a conflicting perspective of a mined 
and destroyed future is unleashed in public by local com -
munities who vociferously demonstrate against lithium 
exploration.
Discursive position 2: the mined future Fent and Kojola 
argue that [32] “various temporal aspects—such as his -
tory, memory, speed, delay and epistemologies of time—
play a central role in how struggles and controversies 
over extractivist development manifest themselves in 
certain places” (p. 819). This idea is essential for under -
standing the case of lithium mining in Portugal, given 
that the local populations who manifest themselves live

on or own land and dwell in regions which have suffered 
over the years from an intense exodus of the people to 
metropolitan areas. In addition, they are quite unpro -
tected regarding access to essential public services, hav -
ing remained classified as “interior, ” which is associated 
with a slow pace of life, less economic development, and 
deficient industrial activity.
The exploitation of lithium is perceived as a disruptive 
element of this temporality. In most reports against lith -
ium, slogans refer to it as “no to cancer, no to death, yes 
to the future, ” with messages of slow temporality, calm, 
tranquility, and difference underlying these more violent 
protests. Lithium exploitation is represented as a signifi -
cant temporal disruption because of the general contami -
nation it means for social organization, the economy, and 
society.
Part of the population, supported by political parties, 
environmental organizations, and other local actors, pro -
tested, sought UNESCO, and shared information widely 
through various channels. Lisbon witnessed this demon -
stration with the banners chanting “no to the Mine, yes to 
life, ” “no to a mined future, ” and “no to Cancer” (Fig. 1).
The future is treated as a human rights matter and an 
inalienable identity mark: local communities claim “our 
future. ” Using the metaphor of mines, typical of lith -
ium mining, they argue that their future is now mined, not destroyed, but discounted, not retaining its original 
value. The analysis of this information shows that during 
2019 and 2020, local communities feared lithium explo -
ration in the territories, considering it a mine that would 
destroy their desirable and expected futures (Fig. 2).
For most of these regions, the pace of life has become a 
tacit marker of authenticity. Several media outlets have 
published stories of people saying that their lives had 
been condemned to change because of the new mines. 
One Morgade inhabitant describes having his entire 
future invested in the town; his livelihood is agriculture. 
The imminent threat of the mines raises red flags about 
“land occupation and water contamination” [57]. He says, 
“young people like me who could go abroad but chose to 
stay, who invested everything here and now this could 
mean the end of our dream” [57]. Another person from 
Morgade declares that the whole village is “worried” 
[57], stating that “both the old and the young are worried 
about our future, and we will continue to fight as long as 
we have the strength to do so” [57]. Perceived as an attack 
[58], the emergence of lithium exploration led the popu -
lation to protest against the need to “give up our villages” 
[59] by organizing vigils and protests (Table 2).
But it was in 2021 that the dispute between the popula -
tion and the political discourses increased. The people 
showed “total displeasure, ” speaking of a “catastrophe, ” 
claiming on posters: “They won’t get through here, ” 
“We’re not going to let them through, ” “Do you want lith -
ium? Go and get it somewhere else, ” “No to lithium, yes 
to life” (Fig. 3).
In sum, the discourses against lithium mining seem to 
highlight the criticism about who they consider out -
siders and the “other, ” as they say, “We refuse to accept 
people in Lisbon who decide to destroy parts of our vil -
lages, mountains and our quality of life. ” From an initial 
point of view, the inhabitants and also local political

representatives conceive the future as an identity trait, 
which is owned and cannot be alienated, in their opin -
ion. Expectations—while forms of time perspectives and 
futures—seem to be conceived as a matter of collective 
identity. Locals reacted against foreign companies using 
the slogan “Portugal is not for sale” [54], saying they are 
“fighting” the destruction of the land” , as they are certain 
that people will not be able to live there [54].
The right to hold and own a regional and local future that 
local communities can administer has served to justify 
their opposition to sociotechnical investment, calling for 
the suspension of the process (especially the Municipali -
ties of Caminha, Ponte de Lima, and Viana do Castelo and SOS Serra d’Arga, Montalegre com Vida, Movimento 
Não às Minas, among others) [60, 61]. They claim their 
“sacred mountain deserves to be protected and recog -
nized. ” Similar voices join reports circulating in the inter -
national arena. They claim that “The lush, green hills 
where Paulo Pires has for years brought sheep to graze 
above his picturesque Portuguese village may soon be 
transformed by the race to power electric vehicles [48]” . 
Inhabitants are aware of their contribution to achiev -
ing European and global energy goals. However, their 
discourses accentuate their present-day refusal to (what 
they perceive to be the) hand over their future to foreign 
companies.Table 2 News about lithium exploration spread in 2020

Statement/discussion: the future as a policy axis
The previous controversy analysis illustrates arguments 
about who “possesses” the future and who can plan and/
or “determine” it. Adam [27], Martins [33], and Appa -
durai [42] call attention to the risks coming from the 
dependence of development on technoscientific innova -
tion. This paper navigated upon a central hypothesis that 
has been highlighted in several other studies on mining 
and extraction [41, 62–66]: the “extraction” inscribed in 
political discourse brings about a parallel temporality, 
which is incompatible with that desired by the population 
and with uncertain effects for the future (mainly those 
that may arise from contamination). In this perspec -
tive, the inhabitants, local governments, political parties 
representatives, and other opposing movements use the 
expression “mined future” to express their lack of confi -
dence in sociotechnical undertakings and in the ability of 
public authorities to anticipate the changes, as well as the 
risks and threats they may bring about.
Final considerations
In 2022, the controversy goes on, with increased atten -
tion from international press. However, some areas, like 
Serra D’Arga were effectively removed from the lithium 
exploration plan [67, 68].
Based on Sewel [69], Beck et  al. [41] state that “Tem -
porality’ refers to the many different ways in which 
change can unfold over time. ” The purpose of this paper 
was to reflect on the temporal perspectives inscribed in 
the debate about lithium mining in Portugal. Drawing 
on some empirical information, we seek to demonstrate 
that perspectives of the future are as crucial as land -
scapes. From the literature review, it is possible to say 
that lithium mining presents several challenges regarding 
temporality at various scales and levels. It encompasses 
the intervention areas’ past and imagined and/or desired 
futures upon populations, memories, and heritages. It 
also imposes broader political challenges regarding how 
politics can manage the contradictions and conflicts that 
emerge with political programs based on the belief in 
technoscientific development [70].
The analysis of the lithium mining case deserves 
further research regarding the diversity of positions 
adopted by the various actors involved, as it gains differ -
ent contours depending on the country, or region. Not -
withstanding, the information collected and analyzed 
allows us to reflect on the adequacy of the theoretical 
formulation we set out at the beginning of the text: the 
capacity of politics to look at social movements aris -
ing against sociotechnical enterprises, some of them 
currently related to the energy transition, through the 
prism of their temporal significance, i.e., the capacity to 
contain the past, present, and future of people, regions, and territories and countries. This reflection would 
lead us to an even broader debate on the participation 
of populations in the design of the future, as advocated 
by Asara et al. [71] and on the role of aspirations in the 
political process, accommodating local populations’ 
needs in co-producing and co-designing the future. In 
other words, it must consider the concept of the future 
as an entity, a human right that is as important as space 
or any other object. This procedure implies incorporat -
ing time and the future into the everyday exercise of 
politics at European and global level. Hence, additional 
research on the socioeconomic dimension of the genesis 
of temporalities is central to managing the contradic -
tions and conflicts posed in decision-making and their 
relationship with the law.
