Adoption ABSTRACT  
Soil testing in agriculture is associated with many economic and environmental benefits. However, previous 
studies have shown that a significant proportion of beef and sheep farmers in the UK do not carry out standard 
soil index testing (pH, available Mg, P and K); with much fewer again carrying out more extensive soil tests (e.g., 
organic matter, micronutrients). This study identifies barriers and motivations to soil testing amongst the beef 
and sheep sector, using a combination of farmer surveys, expert interviews, and a 5-year soil testing dataset from 
the largest commercial UK soil testing laboratory. Evidence for differences in the adoption of soil tests by beef 
and sheep farmers compared to the arable and dairy sectors is explained in relation to: (1) the extent of soil pH 
and nutrient imbalances, linking to the intensity of management in the different sectors; and (2) the extent to 
which farmers perceive links between their soils and their outputs (profits, yield, livestock health). We show a 
greater likelihood for farmers to engage with soil testing when the links to declining outputs are clearer. Our 
results showed that beef and sheep farmers who did engage with soil testing showed greater levels of innovation 
and were more likely to seek advisory support, most often associated with larger farm sizes. Our data also 
highlights the importance of an output-driven approach to initiate an interest in soil analyses amongst less 
engaged farmers. We argue that this avenue offers greater potential for enhancement of farmers ’ knowledge of 
the soil system than a primarily regulatory-driven approach, where soil testing becomes a compulsory action but 
does not lead to subsequent improvements in farm management.   
1.Introduction 
Globally, soil degradation in agroecosystems represents one of the 
greatest threats to achieving food and water security and continues to 
undermine our efforts to combat climate change (Montanarella et al., 
2016; Wuepper et al., 2020 ). This decline in soil quality is typically 
characterised by high rates of soil erosion, a loss of organic matter and 
nutrient imbalances arising from land use change, agricultural intensi -
fication and climate change (Borrelli et al., 2020 ). However, recent years 
have seen a growing recognition of the importance of soils and the 
gradual adoption of more sustainable farming practices (Bouma et al., 
2012; Keesstra et al., 2016 ). Despite these advances, there is still 
considerable scope to improve basic soil management, especially 
through greater adoption of routine soil testing for agronomic use (Carlisle, 2016; Li et al., 2020 ). 
One common approach used to improve on-farm nutrient use effi-
ciency is through nutrient management planning, which include a range 
of soil quality metrics, known as standard soil index testing (e.g., pH, P & 
K indices and Mg content; AHDB, 2020 ). Despite promotion of the po-
tential benefits of soil index testing to farmers (through various chan-
nels), low rates of soil index testing still exist within some farming 
sectors, namely amongst beef and sheep producers (Carlisle, 2016 ). For 
example, in England, only 51% of beef and sheep farmers regularly carry 
out soil index tests compared to 89% of dairy farms and 97% of arable 
(DEFRA, 2013 ). 
The lower rates of soil index testing adoption by the beef and sheep 
sector raises particular concerns. This is because soil testing provides 
opportunities for farmers to optimise productivity and reduce inefficient

2resource use (Goulding et al., 2008; Kettering et al., 2012 ), which can 
help ensure financial resilience at a time where state aid and farm 
subsidies are dramatically declining. Whilst many beef and sheep farms 
are less intensively managed than arable and dairy systems (with lower 
stocking and input levels), particularly those in upland areas and/or 
with areas of high environmental value, factors including topography, 
soil fragility and weather extremes mean these farms can be particularly 
sensitive to nutrient imbalances and losses (Caporn and Emmett, 2009; 
Orr et al., 2008 ). Given these concerns, and the distinctive characteris -
tics of beef and sheep farms, tailored analysis to understand the be-
haviours and rationale of these farmers is needed to ensure widespread 
adoption of soil index testing in the future. 
As our understanding of soil health improves, it has become apparent 
that a more holistic approach to soil testing that incorporates the 
physical, biological and chemical aspects of soils, rather than relying on 
a small suite of indicators through soil index testing (e.g., pH, P, K and 
Mg), can be more informative and beneficial for making farm manage -
ment decisions. It has also been argued that the simplicity of current soil 
index testing impedes knowledge transfer between farm advisors and 
farmers (De Bruyn and Andrews, 2016 ). The use of additional soil tests 
beyond soil index testing (e.g., for micronutrients, organic matter con-
tent, soil texture and microbial biomass) are readily available from soil 
testing facilities across the UK but are not readily adopted. For example, 
in England only 35% of all farms (across all farming sectors) monitor soil 
organic matter (DEFRA, 2018, 2013 ). However, the reasons why and/or 
more advanced soil testing is not undertaken by farmers are unclear, 
preventing the design of effective campaigns to promote greater adop-
tion to improve farm sustainability. For the purpose of this study, we 
define soil index tests used for agronomic purposes, that assess the lime 
and fertiliser/manure application needs to optimize crop production, as 
‘soil tests ’; and those that help with other agronomic decisions and/or 
used to monitor soil health as ‘advanced ’ soil tests. 
Research into how farmers ’ perceptions of soil testing influences 
farm practice has been longstanding, but the lack of widespread adop-
tion remains unresolved (Brandt, 2003; Daxini et al., 2018; Dessart et al., 
2019; Hyland et al., 2018; Ingram et al., 2010; Osmond et al., 2015; 
Prager and Posthumus, 2011 ). Various socio-economic, cultural, insti-
tutional and environmental factors can influence a farmer ’s decision to 
engage with soil testing (Dessart et al., 2019; Hyland et al., 2018; Prager 
and Posthumus, 2011 ). However, the sectoral differences in soil testing 
adoption rates previously noted are largely unexplained; though larger, 
more intensive farms are more commonly seen to test (DEFRA, 2013 ). 
Daxini et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of psychological factors 
alongside socio-economic parameters, particularly attitudinal response 
and social norms, which reflect the benefits perceived from undertaking 
particular behaviours and whether wider peer and public pressure is felt. 
Better understanding of why and how positive attitudinal traits develop 
would advance these insights further. Regulatory pressure can also be a 
critical driver for soil testing, and has continued to increase in recent 
years (DEFRA and EA, 2018 ; Scottish Statutory, 2017; Welsh Govern -
ment, 2020 ). However, regulation to enforce testing does not necessarily 
translate into changes in management (Daxini et al., 2018 ). The po-
tential reasons for this include a lack of awareness or perceived benefit 
amongst farmers, reliance on customary practise, and associated costs 
and difficulties with implementation (Brandt, 2003; Hyland et al., 2018; 
Ingram, 2008; Ingram et al., 2010; Osmond et al., 2015 ). In these in-
stances education therefore seems key, though despite marked educa -
tional efforts in recent years (Ingram, 2008; Krzywoszynska, 2019; Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2015 ) some farmers do not appreciate the potential 
benefits of better management of their soils (Ingram, 2008; Krzy-
woszynska, 2019 ). In turn, this study aims to (i) understand why the beef 
and sheep sector has a much slower soil testing adoption rate in com-
parison to the arable and dairy sector, and (ii) ascertain what socio- 
economic and psychological factors are associated with soil testing 
and planned management behaviours. 2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Grassland and arable soil indices status 
To understand the influence of soil indices on farmers ’ likelihood to 
soil test, we investigated differences in soil pH, P & K indices and Mg 
content between grassland (this encompasses the dairy, beef and sheep, 
as the dataset did not allow for a split between these sectors) and arable 
soils. These indices were chosen as they are the recommended param -
eters to determine lime and fertiliser/manure requirements for optimal 
crop production, as outlined by the RB209 fertiliser manual guidelines 
(hereon noted as ‘RB209∕) (AHDB, 2020 ). This was done using the soil 
analysis data collected by a major UK soil testing lab. The database 
constituted the results of samples submitted by farmers and/or consul -
tants over a 5-year period (2013 –2017). For each soil variable, we 
calculated the proportion of samples from grassland or arable land that 
were lower, optimum and/or higher than the recommended values for 
the corresponding farming sector stated in RB209 (AHDB, 2020 ). In this 
way, differences in relative soil indices were compared between the 
sectors to determine whether this could be influencing the farmer ’s 
decision to soil test. To ensure that samples were from a ‘continuous ’ 
land use (grass or arable), these comparisons were made on a subset of 
soil samples that classified both the previous and next crop as either 
arable or grassland, resulting in 92,001 and 73,454 samples from each 
sector, respectively. 
2.2. Beef and sheep farmers survey 
To attain broad-scale insight into the levels of engagement with soil 
testing amongst beef and sheep farmers, we surveyed 302 such farmers 
from across the UK. This was administered online using Kobo Toolbox 
and widely publicised in the farming press and on social media, and 
conducted face-to-face at key agricultural events between June and 
December 2019. The survey was designed to derive primarily quanti -
tative information on the following points:  
≡Respondent demographics  
≡Farm business characteristics  
≡If/how they tested their soils  
≡Attitudes and rationale regarding soil testing 
≡Current and future management practices (responding to test re-
sults/not)  
≡The influence of regulatory pressures 
The profile of survey participants can be found in Table 1. Some 
open-response questions were also included to provide additional 
qualitative detail to support analysis of the quantitative data. Questions 
were devised to capture both socio-economic and attitudinal factors, 
including perceptions of soil testing and links to outcomes, following 
recommendations from recent studies (see e.g. Daxini et al., 2018 ). 
All statistical analysis of the survey data was carried out using the 
statistical programme R (R Core Team, 2019). We used linear discrim -
inant analysis to calculate the average marginal effects of each factor 
that may contribute to a livestock farmer ’s decision to soil test. The 
response and explanatory variables included in the model are sum-
marised in Table 1. An Innovation score and Positive soil testing 
perception score was calculated for each participant as the sum of an-
swers to relevant questions associated with each, as detailed in Table 1. 
We used the ‘factoextra ’ R package (Kassambara and Mundt, 2019) 
to perform hierarchical clustering analysis on participants ’ Likert re-
sponses (0–1) to statements about how important they perceive soil 
testing can be in improving animal health, yield (of grass), profit, soil 
health and forage (grass or conserved grass) quality. We determined the 
optimal number of clusters through k-means partitioning methods to be 
n 3. Respondents were grouped into their respective farmer group 
clusters and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for each Likert. This J.M.

3was followed by a Dunn multiple comparisons test (Dunn, 1964 ) to 
determine differences between farmer groups for each Likert question. 
Binomial regressions were used to determine whether groupings 
differed characteristically (e.g. Age) and behaviourally (e.g. Innovation 
score) for attributes that were not included in the hierarchical cluster 
analysis. 
2.3. Stakeholder interviews 
To provide further qualitative insight on farmers ’ behaviours, and 
the reasons underpinning these, interviews with eight expert stake -
holders was undertaken in August-September 2019. This primarily 
involved farm advisory consultants who worked with farmers across the 
UK to offer support and advice on soils and associated farm management 
practices. Some of these advisors worked across all farm sectors (4 re-
spondents), whilst others were selected specifically for their specialism 
in pasture-based livestock (3 respondents). Respondents from soil 
testing laboratories, who were also involved in extension activities, were 
also interviewed (1 respondent). Respondents each had over ten years ’ 
experience working in the sector and each work with a at least a hundred 
diverse farms on a regular basis, therefore providing insights from a 
wide cross-sector of the industry. 
Interviews lasted between 30 and 60 min and were audio recorded to 
support transcription and subsequent thematic analysis. All re-
spondents, for both interviews and the survey, were given a project in-
formation sheet and provided their informed consent prior to 
questioning. Saturation in themes was reached after eight interviews, 
meaning further data capture was not necessary. 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Understanding differences in motivations to soil test between sectors 
We found that 99.2% of arable soil samples sent for analysis and 
98.6% from grasslands (dairy, beef and sheep) did not meet the opti-
mum recommended UK guidelines for at least one of the four soil quality 
indicators (pH, P, K and Mg; Fig. 1). These results indicate that under -
performing soils (i.e., soils that do not meet the soil indices criteria for 
optimal crop production) are an influential driver in a farmers ’ moti-
vation to soil test. 
Due to the more intensive nature of arable systems and their greater 
crop offtake rates (Chiari et al., 1989; Withers et al., 2006 ), these soils 
may more readily suffer nutrient or pH imbalances in comparison to 
grassland soils (Muhammed et al., 2018 ). This was reflected by the data 
that showed a lower proportion of soils from arable farms to have 
optimal pH compared to soils from grassland farms (15% and 37% Table 1

4respectively, Fig. 1). On-farm productivity monitoring also varies be-
tween these sectors; arable farmers base this on crop yields, whilst 
grassland farmers traditionally focus on their livestock (e.g., growth, 
weight, health, milk yield, etc.). When productivity is compromised, the 
role of soil indices may therefore be more apparent for arable farmers 
due to the more direct soil–plant relationships compared to the indirect 
soil–plant-livestock relationships. The resulting realisation that their soil 
is underperforming thus explains the higher levels of soil testing adop-
tion by arable farmers than grassland beef and sheep farmers across the 
UK (DEFRA, 2013 ). These differences in focus and awareness were 
outlined by interviewed experts: 
“The combine harvester tells [arable farmers] exactly what each field 
is doing [in terms of yields] but within the livestock sector very few 
[farmers] are measuring grass yield and quality (Expert 3)” 
“Arable farmers aim to produce the maximum yield possible […] 
grassland farmers aim to produce just enough grass for their livestock 
(Expert 1)” 
“[Beef and sheep farmers ’] primary focus, in my experience, is al-
ways going to be their [livestock], not their soil. (Expert 7)” 
Despite this, grassland farmers are increasingly being encouraged to assess visual soil parameters (e.g., compaction or earthworm counts 
Guimar ~aes et al., 2011 ) and to monitor grass yield to better make the 
link between soil condition and farm productivity (AHDB, 2018a, 
2018b ). However, it appears that this has not been widely adopted by 
the beef and sheep sector (Forager, 2017 ) compared to the dairy sector, 
the latter generally being more engaged with such monitoring practices 
and thus more readily associate productivity with soil conditions and 
input management (Beegle et al., 2000 ). In turn, this helps explain their 
higher levels of soil testing compared to beef and sheep farmers (DEFRA, 
2013 ). This notion was supported by Expert 4: 
“I think some of the dairy [farmers] are a little more in tune with soil 
testing, with them being more intensive systems. They also have 
more of a history of soil and tissue testing. (Expert 4)” 
Furthermore, dairy farms produce more manure that is stored in fully 
liquid slurry storage systems compared to beef and sheep farms (DEFRA, 
2013 ), which has also been shown to be positively associated with 
increased adoption of soil testing (Buckley et al., 2015 ). 
We found that motivations to soil test are also linked to engagement 
with independent advisors (Fig. 2), which differs between farming sec-
tors. Traditionally, a higher proportion of cereal and dairy farmers seek

5this type of advice for nutrient management planning compared to beef 
and sheep livestock farmers (85%, 78% and 59%, respectively DEFRA, 
2019 ). We found that 55% of the beef and sheep farmers who soil test do 
so without help from an independent advisor. This highlights a clear lack 
of engagement with independent advisors amongst beef and sheep 
farmers which is also likely to be contributing towards adoption dif-
ferences between sectors. As expressed by Expert 1: 
“Most arable farmers will have an agronomist … grassland farms, 
particularly smaller family-run farms will not have an agronomist or 
any other link to a company that provides this service. (Expert 1)” 
As the above comment highlights, farm size may also be a corre -
sponding factor determining farmer engagement with advisors. Hence, 
the distinction is not just one of farm type, but that farm type often 
correlates with size, with dairy and arable predominantly being larger 
farms (DEFRA, 2015 ). 
3.2. Understanding beef and sheep farm(er) characteristics associated 
with (not) soil testing 
In descending order of average marginal effect, the significant factors 
that differentiated farmers who engaged in soil testing from farmers that 
did not included a higher farmer innovation score, engagement with 
independent advisors, higher farm turnovers and positive perception of 
soil testing (Table 1; Fig. 2). These findings are strongly aligned with 
similar factors identified in the wider literature (Daxini et al., 2018; 
Dessart et al., 2019; Hyland et al., 2018; Prager and Posthumus, 2011 ). 
We saw that increased likelihood to soil test was correlated with 
reported adoption of other forms of innovation (High innovation score, 
Fig. 2) and hence these farmers seemed to be more actively adopting 
new practices to improve their farm systems rather than relying on 
customary practice. It was also notable that our farmer innovation score 
is co-correlated with the positive soil testing perception factor, which 
aligns with wider reporting that farmers adopt new technologies and/or 
farm practices when they perceive that an innovation will lead to pos-
itive impacts (see also Pannell et al., 2006 ). We also found that engagement with an independent advisor in-
creases the likelihood a farmer would soil test by 15% (Fig. 2). This 
demonstrates the crucial role advisors play initiating soil awareness, 
linking soil condition (e.g. soil indices) to farm productivity and sup-
porting farmers to make appropriate management decisions based on 
test results (Daxini et al., 2018; Ingram, 2008 ). Farm turnover was also 
identified as an important factor (Fig. 2), where farmers with a below 
average turnover were 12% less likely to soil test (Fig. 2). This is likely to 
be linked to farms with higher financial turnovers generally being 
associated with more intensive systems, which typically have greater use 
of resources, and greater financial capacity to engage with advisors and 
implement the measures advised. Despite farm size not significantly 
contributing to soil testing adoption (Fig. 2), we saw a general trend 
where soil testing adoption is less frequent on smaller farms, similar to 
Ribaudo and Johansson (2007) and Daxini et al. (2018) . This also aligns 
with a wider acknowledgement that small farmers have lower levels of 
turnover (DEFRA, 2015 ). 
Finally, we found that farmers with a negative attitude towards soil 
testing were less likely to adopt soil testing than those who were more 
positive (Fig. 2), due to a general lack of awareness or perceived benefit. 
This was further confirmed by 49% of non-soil testers reporting that they 
“didn ’t see the point ” of soil testing. This aligns with the findings of 
Daxini et al. (2018) on the psychological parameters underpinning de-
cision making. 
To further our understanding on how differences in soil testing 
perceptions influences the likelihood to soil test, we utilised hierarchical 
cluster analysis to identify distinct farmer groups based on how impor -
tant they thought soil testing was for improving animal health, profit, 
soil health, forage quality and yield (these responses were averaged 
together to produce the perception parameter within our binomial 
regression). We identified three distinct groups (Fig. 3); 1) The Engaged 
farmers that expressed the highest level of positivity towards soil testing 
and had the highest engagement with soil testing, 2) The Semi-engaged 
farmers who expressed slightly more conservative views than The 
Engaged but still demonstrated high soil testing adoption, and 3) The 
disengaged , who expressed less confidence for soil testing improving

6most aspects on the farm and a much lower proportion of which engaged 
with soil testing. This supports our findings from our binomial regres -
sion analysis by reinforcing the association between positive soil testing 
perceptions and soil testing adoption (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4a). 
The characteristics of our identified farmer groups found that The Disengaged had a much higher proportion of older farmers than The 
Engaged and Semi-engaged (Fig. 4c). Although our binomial analysis did 
not determine age as a contributing factor for poor soil testing adoption, 
when splitting the data into groups, it was clear that age influenced soil 
testing perceptions (Fig. 4c) and consequently adoption (Buckley et al.,

72015 ). Our identified farmer groups and their characteristics were also 
strongly supported by interviewed experts; 
“You get more progressive, interested farmers that are engaged and 
take advantage of soil workshops. They read the literature and they 
learn. And then you have other farmers who are less engaged and just 
doing things how they ’ve always done. (Expert 1)” 
“There is a better understanding of the importance of soils with 
[younger farmers]. (Expert 3)” 
The Engaged placed higher importance on the perceived benefits soil 
testing offers for improvements to each of these aspects on the farm, 
animal health, profit, soil health, forage quality and yield compared to 
The Semi-engaged and Disengaged (Fig. 3), as did The Semi-engaged when 
compared to The Disengaged. These findings highlight the need to rein-
force how soil testing has the potential to benefit the farm, which cor-
responds to arguments made in section 3.1, regarding the importance of 
connecting soil to measurements of productivity/optimisation. 
To fully appreciate the particularities of the beef and sheep sector, it 
is important to note that within our high soil testing adoption groups, 
The Engaged and Semi-engaged , we still found a small proportion of 
farmers who do not soil test (Fig. 4a), suggesting that in some instances 
farmers selectively choose not to soil test, even though they report a 
general awareness of the benefits soil testing can bring. This can be due 
to several factors that constrain production or ambition to maximise 
productivity, such as farmland that is part of an environmental scheme 
that prohibits application of high input levels (Welsh Government, 
2019 ). 
Of those livestock farmers that did not soil test, 22% stated that this 
was because they were satisfied with their productivity and did not 
intend to increase grass growth to meet their feed requirements. This is 
not unsurprising – typical nutrient application rates (as both fertiliser/ 
manure) on extensive beef and sheep farms are often considerably lower 
than what is recommended to increase grass yields (AHDB, 2020; British 
Survey of Fertiliser Practise, 2019 ). Nutrient application recommenda -
tions based on soil index tests from such farms could therefore be 
notably higher than those rates currently applied. The environmental 
costs of such farmers acting on this advice, such as greater potential for 
eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions from greater application 
of fertilisers/manures should be considered. From an economic 
perspective, there is a rationale for better optimisation of productivity, 
but it was notable that 24% of respondents did not test due to perceived 
‘high costs associated with acting on advice ’. For example, liming to 
increase soil pH can cost more than the value of the extra return (Gib-
bons et al., 2014 ). Critical to this is whether recommendations following 
testing would reveal scope to optimise interventions within financially 
beneficial margins. 
3.3. Soil testing adoption through policy 
Finally, we consider the impact of policy. Here, we found that 65% of 
those farmers that were soil testing reported policy as a factor that 
influenced their decision to test (19%, important, 18%, fairly important 
and 28% very important). However, such regulation has only recently 
been implemented in England and whilst other countries in the UK are 
also likely to follow (DAERA, 2019; DEFRA and EA, 2018 ; Scottish 
Statutory, 2017; Welsh Government, 2020; DAERA, 2019 ; DEFRA and 
EA, 2018; Scottish Statutory, 2017; Welsh Government, 2020 ) this 
perceived pressure could therefore increase in the future. However, 
compulsory soil testing may not necessarily translate into good man-
agement behaviours (Daxini et al 2018 ). Instead, Daxini et al. (2018) 
and experts we interviewed felt that a notable proportion of farmers 
were just doing the minimum to meet regulatory requirements, and 
engagement with testing was not substantively improving their under -
standing of, or care for, their soil. “I want nutrient management plans to be used and not just stored in 
preparation for inspection … I worry the legislation is going to take 
us away from all the good work [advisors have] been doing to 
encourage good soil testing practice, and therefore it just becomes a 
compliance exercise … (Expert 3)” 
Our survey results do not reflect these fears, showing that a high 
proportion of farmers were following the management advice for 
nutrient application rates (as both fertiliser/manure) and lime applica -
tion rates based on their soil index tests (data not shown), with only a 
very small proportion ignoring the advice altogether (which was often 
explained in relation to environmental restrictions, connecting with 
points outlined above). However, the concerns raised by the interviewed 
advisers is clearly reflected in the wider literature. This is perhaps due to 
difference in context across different studies, with regulatory obligations 
more widespread in Ireland than in parts of the UK for example (Daxini 
et al., 2018 ). 
3.4. Advanced soil testing 
In line with DEFRA (2018, 2013) , we found far fewer beef and sheep 
farmers to undertake advanced soil tests compared to conventional soil 
index testing (Fig. 5). Reasons for this are likely to be similar to those we 
identified with poor soil index testing adoption. Furthermore, poor 
adoption is also likely to be associated with the lack of standardised 
protocols, guidance as to which tests farmers should be engaging with 
and how to interpret the results (Briggs and Eclair-Heath, 2017 ). 
4.Conclusions 
Our analysis explores the influence of soil condition, socio-economic 
factors and psychological factors associated with lower levels of soil 
index testing amongst the UK beef and sheep sector, compared to their 
dairy and arable counterparts. We argue that it is accentuated by the 
characteristics of the beef and sheep sectors, where farms are generally 
smaller, have a lower turnover and engage less with advisory support 
compared to arable and dairy counterparts (Chiari et al., 1989 ; DEFRA 
ONS, 2015). Whilst this might appear to offer a poor prognosis for 
improved adoption in the future, our data also affirms the importance of 
an output driven approach to support farmer engagement with soil 
testing. We argue this approach offers greater potential to enhance 
farmers ’ knowledge of the soil system than a primarily regulatory driven 
approach, where soil testing becomes compulsory but does not neces -
sarily lead to good management practice.

8Finally, our analysis raises some points of caution, firstly for exten -
sive farms with high environmental importance, the imperative to soil 
test seems less obvious as farmers may be restricted (through environ -
mental schemes) in their capacity to act on recommended inputs from 
soil test results. Secondly, if farmers are not aware of an apparent eco-
nomic return from soil testing, farmers would be less inclined to do so. 
Nonetheless, these should be considered in future policy and market 
contexts where the need to optimise grass production and utilization will 
be fundamental to the survival, and ultimate success, of farmers in these 
sectors.
