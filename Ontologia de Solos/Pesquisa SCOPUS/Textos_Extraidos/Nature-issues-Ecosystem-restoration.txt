Abstract
Ecosystem restoration initiatives present natures as intervention-requiring problems. However,not all stakeholders may be able to recognise and relate to the issues that motivate restoration.
Instead, they may put forward alternative understandings of natures as problematic issues in
need of management and collective action. Therefore, ecosystem restoration can turn generativeinto new forms of publics that are brought together –and drawn apart –by distinctive con ﬁgura-
tions of nature-issues. This paper analyses such a reorganisation by focusing on three restoration
projects carried out in Finland. The projects sought to engage farmers in restoring agriculturalstreams while proposing the practice of stream restoration as an extensive ecosystem revitalisa-
tion. In the studied cases, farmers could become attentive to the potential of stream habitats to
develop into viable and rich ecosystems, while their neighbours only showed interest in improvingthe drainage functions of streams. The restoration initiatives generated connectedness between
farmers, streams habitats and the restoration projects, but also disconnectedness between natures
and publics. The possibilities of the studied projects to carry out their restoration plans restedmostly on the speci ﬁcation of the restoration plans as a means to manage ontological differences.
Theﬁndings indicate that instead of promoting ecosystem restoration as a tightly coupled practice,
it can be useful to generate space for collective action that unfolds in terms of partially differentnatures and nature-issues.

Introduction
As we have entered the United Nations ‘Decade of Ecosystem Restoration ’(2021 –2030) and the
European Union (EU) Nature Restoration Law has entered into force (European Commission,
2024), the role of ecosystem restoration initiatives as political interventions and potential sources
of controversy deserves ever more attention. In cases in which the realisation of ecosystem restor-ation is not in the hands of a single operator but calls for collective action, the implementation of
restoration initiatives can be a particularly complicated task. The actors who are to become engaged
need to agree on common rules and procedures and allocate costs and responsibilities. Moreover,while negotiating the need, scale and content of restoration measures, the stakeholders are to take a
stand on what exactly the common problem or nature-issue is. Issues mobilise participation
(Marres, 2007; 2015), but ecosystems –as open-ended, multidimensional and diversely engaging
networks –are unlikely to translate to action-provoking nature-issues straightforwardly or
congruently.
Within natural resource management literature, collective action is often expected to require that
the actors who are to become engaged with the joint effort acknowledge their mutual connectedness
to the managed entity, such as a watershed (e.g. Pahl-Wostl, 2007; Tàbara and Pahl-Wostl, 2007).
Management projects and practices are assigned the task of turning nature into a connecting object.In the domain of ﬂood risk management, Bark and Acreman (2020; see also Acreman et al., 2018)
refer to ‘wholescape thinking ’, which can provide a basis for the collective ownership of a
nature-issue. The material connectedness caused by poor water ﬂow and increasing ﬂood risk is
supposed to generate social glue if only the participants can learn to trust each other and the fairness
of the collaborative arrangements (Valve, 2018).
The proposition that watersheds, rivers or stream ecosystems –or any natures for that matter –
can act as unambiguous drivers of collective action is nonetheless problematic (Adams, 2021;
Valve, 2018). Stream ecosystems, for example, may not turn engaging and ‘sticky ’(Hodder,
2012: 94; Usher et al., 2021) reliably or evenly. This is due to two reasons. First , the landscapes
to which restoration projects are introduced may be ontologically multiple from the outset.
Streams are differently present in the everyday lives of the envisioned participants. In farming com-
munities, daily practices and their technical aid generate concrete and virtual paths for sensing,moving along and caring for what lives on farms and in their surroundings (Bear, 2021;
Krzywoszynska, 2016; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015; Singleton, 2012; Valve and Salminen, 2022).
Therefore, farmers perform ontological work, enacting different natures along with their diverseactivities.
Second , restoration projects have the capacity to intervene in rural life in ways that shift and
reorganise social –material relations. In the project settings, farmers and other landowners articulate
ontological differences and perform ontological work using new tools and practices. The projects
provide means to learn about what is present –or not –in ecosystems and indicate how these
shortages or excesses matter and what needs to be done to remake ecosystems. At the sametime, different and perhaps contrasting claims may be made about habitats as problematic
nature-issues. The result is that the accommodation of a restoration initiative ‘involves much
more than the addition of new knowledge and things to social life ’(Marres, 2009: 119). Instead,
ecosystem restoration initiatives bring actors and natures together and draw them apart in new
ways, being thus generative to novel forms of social –material connectedness and disconnectedness.
In this paper, we contribute by generating and applying analytical means to examine the reorga-
nising capacities of ecosystem restoration initiatives. We focus on three restoration projects carried
out in Finland from 2012 onwards. The projects sought to engage farmers in restoring agricultural
streams while proposing a new comprehension and practice of stream restoration as an extensiveecosystem revitalisation. Through interviews with farmers, project coordinators and scientists,Valve and Valkama 2165
among others, we trace how the restoration initiatives reorganised social –material relations as the
terms of collective action were negotiated. Speci ﬁcally, what forms of connectedness and discon-
nectedness did the projects spark into being? Moreover, what mediating means allowed the projects
to realise a collective ecosystem restoration in the differentiated conditions?
Studying the reorganising role of ecosystem restoration initiatives calls for focusing on the
material publics (Marres and Lezaun, 2011; Marres, 2015; Usher et al., 2021), which emerge as
a response to the initiatives. One type of public may gain shape as actors –in our case, farmers
–are moved and brought together by a shared restoration-requiring nature. This is likely to be
the public that a restoration initiative seeks to generate. However, not all farmers may be able to
recognise and relate to the issue that motivates the restoration initiative. This does not need tomean that they would downright oppose ecosystem restoration but rather that the farmers may
ﬁnd themselves as ‘outsiders who are too entangled in issues for their indifference to these
issues to be unproblematic, yet they are strangers to the current settings, languages and networksof issue formation ’(Marres, 2015: 139). These outsiders may put forward an alternative under-
standing of the nature-issue in need of management and collective action. Another material
public gains shape, implying that disconnectedness unfolds in terms of two publics, each positioneddifferently in relation to the restoration initiative.
Rural Finland serves well our analysis of ecosystem restoration as a reorganiser of social –mater-
ial relations. In Finland, natural resource management has created political controversies (Halla andLaine, 2022; Peltola et al., 2018; Raitio, 2013; Valve et al., 2013). Furthermore, attempts at con ﬂict
mediation have been shown to create additional disconnectedness. A particular wolf controversy is
telling in this respect (Peltola et al., 2018). At the heart of the controversy was the size of the wolfpopulation in a rural region. In the EU, the grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) is a protected species, but
hunting can be allowed if the size of its population is estimated to justify it. It is common for
hunters to argue that wolf populations have grown harmfully large. In a speci ﬁc rural region, the
debate between hunters, and population ecologists who calculate the size of the wolf population,
became exceptionally heated. To resolve this situation, the ecologists invited the hunters to join
their inventory. However, this move evoked anger in the local hunters ’union, which ended up orga-
nising a protest in which the volunteer hunter-calculators were accused of disloyalty. Thus, the
co-calculation of the wolves acquired unexpected disconnecting capacities. The intervention gen-
erated ‘publics not intended ’(Peltola et al., 2018: 162), dividing the hunters ’community and dee-
pening the rift between the population ecologists and hunters (Peltola et al., 2018.)
The development of sustainable farming practices and the care of agricultural environments in
Finland have also raised disagreements (Huttunen et al., 2024; Puupponen et al., 2022; Valve andSalminen, 2022). Agriculture accounts for a small part of the national economy but plays an import-
ant role in rural regions and in the maintenance of the national security of supply (Kovalainen et al.,
2024). In Finland, grain production meets its northern limits, thus implying that grain production isconcentrated in the southern parts, while grass cultivation and ruminant husbandry dominate in the
more northern parts (Puupponen et al., 2022). There were approximately 44,000 farms in Finland in
2022, but the number of farms has decreased signi ﬁcantly over the past 10 years. However, as the
size of the arable area has remained relatively unchanged, this means an increase in the size of indi-
vidual farms (Natural Resources Institute Finland, 2023.)
Out of the approximately 2.2 million hectares of arable land in Finland, almost 90% is estimated
to require drainage to remove excess water from ﬁelds (Järvenpää and Savolainen, 2015).
Agricultural drainage in the boreal region is essential for managing water levels and maintaining
soil health and productivity (Peltonen-Sainio et al., 2021). An agricultural drainage infrastructureconsists of subsurface drainage, ditches and agricultural streams. Inﬁelds, excess water is chan-
nelled to ditches that discharge the water to the agricultural stream. The agricultural stream must
have the capacity to channel water further to a river, lake or sea. However, the ﬂow of the2166 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
agricultural stream may slow down due to erosion and the takeover of stream vegetation. Collective
action must then occur to restore the common stream. Today, restoration is increasingly considered
a means of ecosystem revitalisation (Adams et al., 2004; EEA, 2015; Västilä et al., 2021). This
mainstreaming of ‘nature-based solutions ’in managing water in farmlands is also identi ﬁed as a
key measure in the national climate change adaptation plan (Government of Finland, 2022).
However, paradigm changes in restoration methods imply that farmers with ﬂood-sensitive ﬁelds
who still remember the digging done decades ago must reset their expectations regarding the mea-sures that must be taken to restore an agricultural stream.
Stream restoration as ecosystem revitalisation
Governments are seeking new ways to combat biodiversity loss in conditions in which the nature –
culture dichotomy that has dominated the understanding of biodiversity protection is being under-
mined. According to Usher (2023: 1253), the current shift to restoration is ‘not simply a change of
policy but a fundamental reorientation of the collective mindset that increasingly recognizes the
potentially meaningful role of humans in world-making ’. Moreover, while restoration is still asso-
ciated with helping recover something that has been ‘degraded, damaged or destroyed ’(SER, 2004:
3; cited by Usher, 2023), bringing back an authentic ‘natural state ’is no longer a self-evident
objective (Usher, 2023). Instead, conditions are to be generated for novel ecosystems (Hobbs
et al., 2009) that have more diversity than existing ones.
In the context of water management, advocates of ecosystem restoration have, for some time,
argued for a paradigm change that would imply a shift from merely managing water ﬂows
towards revitalising stream and river habitats (Adams et al., 2004; EEA, 2015; Moss, 2007).However, streams and rivers continue to be treated chie ﬂy as hydrological entities that can be
used for the maximal control of water ﬂows. As one sign of this, stream restoration in the
Finnish language can refer to the mere deepening and straightening of a stream.
Treating streams as mere hydrological entities and applying conventional dredging have been
argued to be environmentally harmful (Blann et al., 2009; Gramlich et al., 2018), apt to disturb
material cycles and water ﬂows and to impoverish riverine habitats. A more revitalising approach,
in turn, would ensure that the water ﬂows suf ﬁciently while keeping the ﬂow slow and the stream
bottom irregular. These features provide favourable conditions for nutrient retention and the habi-
tation of ﬂora and fauna. Furthermore, the ecosystem revitalisation approach to stream restoration
emphasises ﬂoodplains as buffers and biodiversity-rich habitats at the intersections of wet and ter-
restrial ecosystems (Powell et al., 2007; Usher, 2023; Västilä et al., 2021). These habitats are critical
for pollinating insects and, thus, for agriculture.
In the water management literature and practice, the paradigm change is often described as a shift
from conventional dredging to the construction of a two-stage channel, with ﬂoodplains on one or
both sides of an agricultural stream (Figure 1) (Powell et al., 2007; Västilä et al., 2021). Evidence onthe potential of a two-stage channel design to help minimise the harmful effects of ﬂood prevention
and enhance ecosystem revitalisation exists particularly in the United States, where several states
have de ﬁned two-stage channels as the best management practice in agricultural water management
(D’Ambrosio et al., 2014; DeZiel et al., 2019). Elsewhere, more research and experimentation are
considered critical for assessing the potential of two-stage channels (Västilä et al., 2021). Moreover,
two-stage channels are not the best restorative solution in all hydrological conditions (Sand-Jensen,1998; Wang et al., 2015).
In Finland, agricultural income rests signi ﬁcantly on ﬁeld area-based Common Agricultural
Policy support (Huuskonen et al., 2020). When a two-stage channel and a ﬂoodplain are con-
structed, the farmer may lose support for the arable land under the ﬂoodplain. Moreover, ﬂoodplains
cannot be cultivated. The construction costs of two-stage channels are estimated to be about three toValve and Valkama 2167
four times higher than conventional maintenance dredging due to the extensive excavation and
transportation of soil that may be needed (Västilä et al., 2021). However, national public supportincreasingly covers additional costs. Nonetheless, it has been estimated that ‘farmers often prefer
conventional drainage methods ’(Västilä et al., 2021: 16) over the two-stage channel solutions.
Resource management in contested material conditions
Scienti ﬁc models and inventories help to subject natures to ecosystem restoration and ﬂood preven-
tion. The tools are used to indicate whether, and in what terms, ecosystems con ﬁgure as problematic
issues. However, the enactments may not offer room for the experiences and entanglements of those
whose lives are shaped, for example, by water and its movements (Wilson and Inkster, 2018; Yateset al., 2017). Such a mismatch was experienced during the 2000s in North Yorkshire, England,
where, despite severe ﬂoods, the local dwellers found no way to associate with the risk assessments
andﬂood defence plans (Donaldson et al., 2013; Whatmore and Landström, 2011; Whatmore,
2013). However, a research project assembled a separate ‘competency group ’to generate an alter-
native account of ﬂooding as a management-demanding issue. This account provided the backdrop
for developing an alternative ﬂooding model (Whatmore and Landström, 2011).
While the Yorkshire example is valuable in many respects, it may be read to indicate that
resource management initiatives can gain wide-reaching engaging capacities if they rest on the
co-production of management-relevant knowledge. However, as shown by the co-calculation ofthe wolf population (Peltola et al., 2018), even inclusive analytical designs may back ﬁre. The solu-
tion is not to refrain from knowledge co-production but to acknowledge the uncontrollable, reorga-
nising tendencies of all management interventions. Fragmentation does not need to be only a badthing. The different arguments and understanding of what should be at stake in restoration may
support a ‘healthy difference and debate ’(Michael, 2009: 626), perhaps helping to make restoration
plans more robust. Yet counterpublics may also evolve through stark ‘identi ﬁcation with, and dif-
ferentiation from, various other actors ’(Michael, 2009: 618). In the wolf calculation experiment,
the hunters who turned into wolf calculators became, at least momentarily, outcasts of the hunter
collective (Peltola et al., 2018). The possibilities for constructive dialogue were then limited.
Restoration initiatives may also generate disconnectedness along their analytical efforts.
Although restoration projects embody understandings of the nature-issues they seek to address,
Figure 1. Typical (a) conventionally dredged stream, (b) and (c) a two-stage channel and (d) a two-stage
channel after construction. From Västilä et al., 2021, courtesy of Kaisa Västilä.2168 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
they also operate as sites of knowledge production. The material differences that become articulated
in detailed inventories and measurements may indicate that the object of intervention is so hetero-
geneous that the restoration measures need to vary from one location to another.
Material heterogeneity enacted in restoration projects may pave the way for solutions that allow
different publics to coexist. When tailoring of measures becomes possible and even necessary, it
may also turn out that a river or stream, or other objects of restoration, can gain multiple capacities
at the same time. This can serve the engagement of different material publics. Such management ofontological differences quali ﬁes as ontological cleaving (Lavau, 2013). In the Goulburn River in
Australia, water ﬂow has been managed as both farming-enabling ‘irrigation water ’and ecosystem-
maintaining ‘environmental water ’(Lavau, 2013). The different waters and publics are ‘made to
hang together or partially connect through the coordination and distribution of ontological differ-
ence’(Lavau, 2013: 418). In other words, the enabling of social –material disconnectedness has
allowed unproblematic co-existence of different publics.
In the United Kingdom, restoring riverine habitats has also been reported to proceed under con-
ditions of ontological differences. While renewing restoration practices has rested on the efforts of
committed environmental experts (Adams et al., 2004), these ‘restoration champions ’have been,
according to their own testimony, regarded by water management engineers as ‘whimsy ’–as
chaps ‘interested in the birds and the plants ’(Adams et al., 2004: 1935). In other words, the cham-
pions have shown attentiveness to more-than-humans at a width and depth that old-school ﬂood
defence professionals have regarded as strange. Consensus has been sought from win –win restor-
ation solutions capable of ‘not only improving riparian or in-stream habitat but also increasing the
ﬂood storage capacity of the ﬂoodplain and helping prevent serious ﬂooding downstream ’(Adams
et al., 2004: 1937). The restorative approaches that were introduced resemble the solutions advo-
cated in Finland as a means by which stream restoration could be increasingly transformed into
a practice of ecosystem revitalisation.
Analysis of the restoration projects
The three restoration projects we analyse in this paper were carried out in Finland between 2012 and2023. Figure 2 shows the locations of the agricultural streams to be revitalised in the projects. We
used the multi-case approach to bring together experiences from different processes and sites. The
projects quali ﬁed as case studies as ambitious agricultural stream restoration initiatives. Only a few
such projects have been conducted in Finland.
The three projects that experimented with new restoration methods were introduced to rural con-
ditions that were simultaneously evolving and at a standstill. The agricultural streams evolved asvegetation and erosion were taking over at a scale that caused the streams to lose their water-
channelling and ﬂood-preventing capacities. However, in recent years, farmers have not come
together to ﬁnd remedies to the situation. In this sense, little was happening. Thus, the public res-
toration initiatives could be expected to be highly needed. In the projects, the enrolment of the land-
owners –primarily farmers –was nonetheless a precondition for the stream restoration to proceed.
The farmers were to pay their share of the work based on the amount of land they owned and applystate support for restoration as a single collective. The projects covered all planning costs, con-
ducted environmental inventories and organised meetings and other events in which the restoration
plan could be discussed.
We became involved in the restoration projects when the engineers and natural scientists
working on the projects or studying the implications of the restoration measures invited us to
analyse the shaping and operation of the restoration collectives. The ‘social side ’, as our colleagues
put it, had failed to gain analytical attention. This failure was considered problematic, as the ‘social
side’could become a bottleneck hindering the shift towards a more sustainable stream restoration.Valve and Valkama 2169
Table 1 summarises the key characteristics of the restoration projects. When we started our
research, two of the projects were running, while the Leppioja project had concluded about a
decade ago. However, we knew that some monitoring and maintenance activities were constantly
being performed in Leppioja. In the Raasepori and Uuhikonoja projects, stream restoration was partof a larger palette of measures applied to reduce nutrient run-offs from agriculture. All the sites were
vulnerable to ﬂooding, and water regularly rose to large ﬁeld areas, particularly during the spring

and autumn ﬂood periods. Topography varies widely within catchments, but the ﬁelds are mainly
relatively ﬂat. Nevertheless, there were some steeper, erosion-sensitive slope ﬁelds in the Raasepori
area.
Local municipalities initiated and ran the Leppioja and Raasepori projects. Meanwhile, the
Uuhikonoja stream was restored by a research project. All three projects were originally planned
to last from three to four years, but if weather conditions restricted dredging, the projects were
granted an extension.
The projects sought to engage the farmers by c ontacting them throu gh letters, emails and
newspaper advertisements that presented the restoration pla ns in general terms and invited
the landowners and tenant farmers to joint me etings. During the projects, additional public
events were arranged. In additio n, project workers and suppor ting consultants visited many
of the affected farms to study the speci ﬁc conditions and restorative possibilities. In
Raaseporinjoki, the project coordinator invited some volunteers to conduct ecosystem inventor-ies and convened a Facebook page for all those in terested in the progress of the restoration
project to join.
As shown in Table 1, the restoration projects analysed were all carried out in regions where
crop production dominates over animal husbandry. In Finland, about two-thirds of farms grow
crops, such as cereals, fodder crops and potatoes, while the remainder also raise domestic
animals. Crop farms in Finland vary in how dependent farmers are on agricultural income.Farmers may have additional and even more primary sources of income (Huttunen, 2019).
Recently, increases in energy, fertiliser an d other input prizes have decreased the pro ﬁtability
of agricultural production, as the increased costs cannot be transferred further in the food
chain without delay.
The 18 interviews were conducted between May 2021 and October 2022. As the Leppioja res-
toration was conducted way back in 2012, we had no data about the responses initiated by theproject during its early days; instead, we focused on the modes of (dis)contentedness identi ﬁable
at the time of the interviews. Due to COVID-19, about half the interviews were conducted
through Teams or by phone. As shown in Table 1, over half of the interviewees in each casewere landowners. With a few exceptions, the landowners were farmers. The number of
farmers ’interviews was planned to be higher, but it turned out that the farmers were not
always willing to give interviews. In the forth coming analysis, we treat this resistance as a
ﬁnding in its own right.
In addition to the interviews, we were able to engage with the projects through our colleagues,
who frequently visited the restoration sites as ecosystem revitalisation experts and scientists. Thesecolleagues provided us with reports about their visits and conducted interviews when possible. In
the interviews, we asked the interviewees to describe how they became involved with the restor-
ation projects, what they thought about the restoration initiatives and what moments and eventsthey considered important for the shaping of the restoration collective. In the case of farmers
and other landowners, we asked them to tell us about the stream histories and their restoration
needs and prospects.
All the interviews were transcribed and then analysed with the NVivo software. We coded
the data using broad categories, such as ‘history of the restoration project ’and‘enrolment
of landowners ’. Only by carefully reading the coded texts did we become attentive to the
ontological work of which the interviewees pr ovided accounts when describing their thoughts
on ecosystem restoration. This process resulted in the identi ﬁcation of different con ﬁgurations
of nature-issues and accounts of differentiatin g publics. Altogether, we analysed the inter-
views as descriptions of the coevolution of ont ological work and political associations and
as verbal enactments of on tological differences –that is, as occasions and means of ontological
work.Valve and Valkama 2171
Results
Material mediation of restoration in Uuhikonoja
The Uuhikonoja stream was chosen as a test site for a research project by several volunteer candi-
dates. Landowners around Finland could offer their stream to be restored in the project by respond-
ing to a newspaper announcement. For a farmer owning a signi ﬁcant amount of farmland by the
side of Uuhikonoja, the restoration initiative appeared intriguing because it sought to achieve some-
thing new with its emphasis on ecosystem revitalisation. Together with some neighbours, the
farmer entered Uuhikonoja for competition over a test site nomination.
There hasn ’t been anyone who took responsibility, invited [the farmers] together and promoted [the res-
toration]. It was also unlikely to happen at this time had there not been this question in the ‘Countryside ’
[the newspaper ‘Future of the Countryside ’]about the existence of agricultural streams [in need of res-
toration] .I’m a bit of the kind of person who can be provoked to try out something new. Sometimes, I
even think about many things differently compared to basic agriculture. So, I thought, let ’s see. I knew
then that if it happened [that the steam becomes chosen as a test site], it would all fall on me. (Farmer 1,
Uuhikonoja)
After Uuhikonoja was chosen as a test site, the research project invited the concerned farmers
together to present the revitalisation plans. For the farmer cited above, the meeting proved to be
a positive surprise. The farmer anticipated that the plans would face considerable opposition.
After the ﬁrst meeting, I thought that it had gone surprisingly well. As I had been afraid that a couple of
farmers would block this [restoration initiative] straight away, it was a surprise that there were no such
farmers. It was a relief. At that point, I thought that we might even reach the ﬁnish with this [restoration].
(Farmer 1, Uuhikonoja)
Another farmer from Uuhikonoja also described the ﬁrst meeting as a turning point. The meeting
allowed the farmers to learn about the restoration plans. According to the farmer, the meeting was
worth attending ‘maybe also because it somehow increased cooperation …you could see face to
face who are involved and get to know those people better ’. However, the farmer emphasised
that‘the environmental impacts were more important to me than the founding of the [restoration]
collective ’(Farmer 2, Uuhikonoja). The collective as an organisational form was depicted as an
instrument to make the restoration happen rather than as a basis for lasting or close connectedness.
In Uuhikonoja, the restoration initiative did not organise social –material relationships in radic-
ally new ways. The scepticism aired by some farmers was regarded as normal: ‘There are always
some farmers who say “no”ﬁrst and others who say “yes, let ’s try it ”, and this is how it went in this
case’(Farmer 3, Uuhikonoja). However, reorganisation occurred in the sense that the stream habi-
tats could become more intimately connected with farm life. For example, one farmer expressed
worries about the survival of the new vegetation sown in the ﬂoodplains. In addition, the restoration
project articulated material differences in new ways. These differences, enacted through an analysis
of the stream morphology, proved to be important sources of material mediation because they
allowed contractionary aspirations to be kept apart.
Let’s say that for a couple of farmers, it would have been dif ﬁcult…if their ﬁelds would have been where
the two-stage channels were constructed, it would have been dif ﬁcult to justify making it like this [as a
two-stage channel] . In this sense, we had good luck that the two-stage channels were located where we
had these eager farmers. (Farmer 3, Uuhikonoja)2172 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
Reorganisation of social –material relations in Raasepori
In Raasepori, the capacity of the restoration initiative to support farmers and other landowners in
becoming increasingly attentive to the agricultural stream was very evident. This increased connect-
edness evolved side by side with new social and practical relationships. As described by one farmer,
engagement with the restoration project provided the possibility of taking part in background inven-tories and exchanging experiences with the project personnel.
Atﬁrst, there were only these meetings in which I participated, and then this project manager and I
became quite good friends …thus, I have been involved with these quite practical tasks. For
example, we have gone to take soil samples, among other things. We have done a lot concretely …to
get the run-offs into better shape …The stream has been discussed, too. During mid-summer, it is
only a small ditch, but particularly at this time of year, there is an awful lot of water. It has been
said that it [the stream] is totally dead. They [project employees] have done some test ﬁshing and
caught nothing, but in fact, there is everything —starting from perches and pikes. When I discussed
this with Dad, who is from an older generation …[he said] they went to catch cray ﬁsh, for example,
and there was this sandy beach, and so on. So, it [the stream] has fallen into bad shape. At the same
time, rains have changed terribly —just over the last ten years. It seems normal now that winters are
really rainy here. (Farmer 1, Raasepori)
Due to the farmers and other landowners who became engaged with the projects and ‘without
whom this [the restoration] would by no means have happened ’(Landowner 1, Raasepori), the eco-
system revitalisation experiments seemed successful. As stated by the of ﬁcer of a regional environ-
mental agency, the farmers appeared to be widely engaged:
We have received really positive feedback from the farmers, saying that it is really great that you have
started to take this [restoration] forward . (Civil servant 1, Raasepori)
The reorganisation that took place did not, however, generate only connectedness and support
for the project realisation. Along with the new forms of connectedness emerged disconnectedness.
In Raasepori, the realisation of stream restoration as ecosystem revitalisation was strongly opposed.However, the views of the farmers criticising the restoration plans are poorly presented in our data.
Despite several attempts, we failed to reach the farmers we suspected of questioning the construc-
tion of the two-stage channels. As these farmers were unreachable by email or phone, we contactedthem during the project events. Eventually, we managed to talk to a reluctant farmer for 15 min
during his ﬁeldwork. The person expressed frustration with the encounter but was ready to articu-
late what he claimed to be a shared criticism of the restoration initiative:
Q: Have you or others in the area had concerns or reservations regarding the functionality of the two-
stage channels …regarding their drainage potentials, for example?
A:Well, yes, it has been discussed a lot why it could not be a traditional one. Many have asked why
these [two-stage channels] would be so good, although they have not been used so much [in stream res-
toration]. The assumption is that they are good, although the experiences are scarce .
Q: Yes, that ’s right. Few such solutions [restorations based on two-stage channels] exist.
A:Yes.Valve and Valkama 2173
Q: But it is good that you ’ll have those built in many sections …
A:Well, this is what we have been asking —that this project of ours is just a guinea pig system of some
sort. (Farmer 2, Raasepori)
The farmer appeared frustrated with the experimental take on stream restoration and with us
asking questions about the ongoing work. Undoubtedly, we were identi ﬁed with the restoration
project. Giving an interview could also be seen as becoming engaged, and engagement as a political
act linking the farmer to what s/he described as a guinea pig system. The reference to the discus-
sions that had taken place, to ‘we’asking critical questions, suggests that in Raasepori the restor-
ation initiative had organised dissatis ﬁed farmers into a counterpublic. From their point of view, the
restoration should focus only on effective drainage that follows the traditional restoration mode.
The nature-issue, as con ﬁgured by the project, was strayed. Moreover, the project turning the
rural setting into a test site was seen as questionable.
Among farmers and landowners in Raasepori, the restoration initiative operated as a source of
disconnectedness. The objections to the restoration plans brought together farmers who constituteda counterpublic. The members of this public questioned the rationale or the ‘guinea pig system ’, and
it was revealed that the shares some landowners had to pay for restoration were substantial. This
caused an active landowner and ‘restoration champion ’to anticipate problems: ‘If no miracles
happen, we already know that at least one major landowner will probably vote against this [revi-
talisation] project ’(Landowner 1, Raasepori).
As the critical voices became louder, the project team had to search for new ways to take the
initiative forward: ‘You cannot get stuck with someone ’s resistance. That ’s the moment to put your-
self at a bit of risk and start testing along a different route …’(Civil servant 2, Raasepori). In the
second round, the planning of the restoration measures proceeded almost metre by metre,thereby enabling farm-speci ﬁc tailoring. Again, the heterogeneous morphology of the agricultural
stream also afforded or even demanded speci ﬁcations. However, the shift from stream-wide plan-
ning to tailored solutions not only opened avenues to make concessions for farmers ’demands and
to fall back to traditional ﬂood prevention solutions. Although the latter might have sometimes been
the result, the move to more detailed planning also allowed new connectedness to evolve between
the project coordinator and the farmers. Restoration was discussed less in terms of a joint projectand more in terms of disconnected solutions.
They [the farmers] had these ideas [for example] that‘this could be a place for a wetland ’. We imme-
diately took that into account …When you call them and say, ‘Hi, it’s me from the project. We have this
settling basin [to propose to you] ’, they say, ‘Okay, let ’s go have a look ’. (Raasepori, project
coordinator)
The multiplying Leppioja
In Leppioja, the stream restoration that was based on the ecosystem revitalisation approach had
already taken place in 2012. Ten years later, one of our colleagues reported that some of thelocal farmers had no idea that they were standing on the ﬂoodplain of a two-stage channel as
they talked with the scientist. The reasons for such ignorance were discussed in an interview we
managed to get from a farmer in Leppioja. The farmer wanted to be very explicit in articulatingthe stream and its capacities. He was drawn to the restoration efforts, although the stream of the
past project was not the stream to which he related then and relates now.2174 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
Q: The restoration and digging of Leppioja took place ten years ago. Did you witness that?
R:Yes, I was a farm owner then .
Q: Okay. Can you remember those times at all? How did you hear about the restoration and the plan to
carry it out in a new way?
R:Well, there were discussions about it, and we allowed it to be done. No big deal .
Q: Allowed it to be done?
R:Yes.
Q: For quite many in Leppioja, the fact that the restoration was carried out as a two-stage channel …they
do not know about that now. That it was such a new solution.
R:Yes, you see, for us, it is only a channel. You don ’t take a second look. The main thing is that water
runs. That ’s the main thing . (Farmer, Leppioja)
By talking in terms of ‘us’, this interviewee seemed to act as a spokesperson for the landowners
who had allowed the new kind of restoration to proceed, as no other ﬁeld drainage and ﬂood pre-
vention options were provided. However, the farmer emphasised that the allowance was given totake measures in relation to a water channel only. This sanitising move cleanses the stream from
speciﬁc life-nurturing capacities. Meanwhile, the ﬂoodplains gain troubling capacities as uncustom-
ary components of farm life.
Q: Is there something you would like to say to those doubting [the feasibility of] the two-stage channel
solutions?
A:No, they can fully form their opinions by themselves.
K: Okay.V:Well, the only bad side to these [two-stage channels] is that the amount of litter is about to increase,
as sow thistles, thistles, willow trees and all those grow. Idle land is not always good from the point ofview of effective farming .
By emphasising that he had just allowed action to be taken, the farmer appeared to say that, in the
project setting, he was merely a spectator, not a member of the experimenting collective. In other
words, he did not fully engage with the restoration efforts, although he at least paid his share of thecosts. The simultaneous sanitation of the agricultural streams from ecosystem-maintaining capaci-
ties and the restoration projects from truly engaging powers provoke questions about the means that
allowed the restoration activities to proceed as planned, albeit restoration issues and publics multi-plied. One of these means was money. The public support allocated to planning the restoration mea-
sures made the initiative, with its ‘strayed ’nature-issue con ﬁgurations, tolerable. After all, the aims
overlapped in terms of the drainage potential of the restored streams. Money took centre stagebecause negotiations about the landowners ’engagement tended to boil down to questions about
monetary costs and expected drainage bene ﬁts. Hardly any farmer can bypass these issues asValve and Valkama 2175
insigni ﬁcant. Moreover, money is a connecting register that allows discussions to proceed in rela-
tion to an apparently commensurate and absolute rural nature.
In Leppioja, we could identify altogether three enactments of the agricultural stream: the one of
the project ’s, the second of the person standing on wide ﬂoodplain without noticing its difference
from traditional narrow ﬂoodplains and, ﬁnally, the third depicted by the interviewed farmer refer-
ring to the stream as being simultaneously new and litter-generating as well as old and ‘only a
channel ’. All these streams, and perhaps even additional ones, no doubt met when the farmers
came together in large numbers to witness the use of a mowing device suited for mowing the ﬂood-
plain (Figure 3). However, we could not piggyback off the exhibition ’s connecting powers. The
audience members unanimously declined our pleas for interviews. The reorganisation of social –
material relations had evidently generated a balance between connectedness and disconnectedness
between the farmers and the project, and this balance was not to be disturbed by asking farmers to
stand out from their collective.
Discussion
The three restoration projects studied in this paper intervened in rural life by seeking to engage land-holders in revitalising agricultural streams and stream habitats. Those owning land by the streamswere to become affected by the potential of the streams to simultaneously serve farmland drainage,
biodiversity protection and even nutrient retention. To a certain extent, the projects strengthened the
connectedness between farmers and agricultural streams, as the ‘restoration champions ’(Adams
Figure 3. Mowing of ﬂoodplains in Leppioja, photo by Pasi Valkama.2176 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
et al., 2004) became more attentive to the existing and potential differences in stream habitats and
closely involved in the implementation of the restoration projects.
The projects also reorganised social –material relations in other and perhaps unexpected ways.
The nature-issue that was supposed to bring the actors together was not as uniform and ﬁxed as
originally assumed. Therefore, instead of bringing the actors together, the restoration initiatives
and their built-in problem con ﬁgurations drew people apart. Some farmers expected this.
Initiating collective action was anticipated to be dif ﬁcult if this action challenged established under-
standings of the streams and their functions. The restoration projects became entwined with pre-
existing diversity and perhaps even political situations (Barry, 2012) that date long back.
Nonetheless, in Uuhikonoja, questioning the ecosystem revitalisation approach was considered anormal feature of the dialectic that characterises communication within the farming community.
In Raasepori and Leppioja, the restoration initiatives provoked notable disconnectedness. For us,
the political associations occasioned by the projects were partly manifested through silence. Thereluctance to give interviews seemed to point to a political role gained by our data collection
efforts. As in the wolf controversy case, data collection proved to generate publics that were not
intended (Peltola et al., 2018). In our case, these publics consisted of farmers who refused toengage in our data collection. Data collection intervened instead of acting, as we implicitly
assumed, as a means to merely follow the traces left by the restoration projects.
In Leppioja, our data collection operated most vividly as space in which an alternative
nature-issue and the ‘normative charge ’(Marres, 2015: 434; Usher et al., 2021) of the agricultural
stream could be articulated. The agricultural stream was nothing but a water channel, even after the
construction of the two-level channel solution. This articulation of the stream seemed to mark thelimits in terms of which liabilities are to be carved out in management of rural natures and resources
(see also Marres, 2015: 136 –137; Valve et al., 2022). As a water channel, the stream obliges farmers
to maintain only the channelling functions while nurturing the pollinator populations, for example,stays outside the liabilities. However, the farmer portraying ﬂoodplains as sources of weeds placed
theﬂoodplains integral to agriculture, but challenged the ideal of idle land as simply life-supportive.
As a result, the nature-issue propagated by the restoration project was indicated to enact a perhapstoo uncomplicated relationship between farming and the two-stage channels.
As ecosystem restoration initiatives target natures that are not as absolute as they may seem from
the point of view of scienti ﬁc assessments and inventories, it has been raised as important to ask
‘what nature ’is being made the object of intervention ’(Huff and Brock, 2023: 2126). Indeed,
the Leppioja ﬁndings show that asking what nature is or should be made an object of intervention
allows to pin down how investments in and sanitations of material capacities unfold, and do soalong with the (re)de ﬁnition of human responsibilities. Materiality can then be used as an analytical
resource to study the shaping of collective action and its terms. Furthermore, taking the ontological
work of potential participants into account helps to prevent situations in which peoples ’engage-
ment matters only as far as it respects the terms of the a priori ontological settlement
(Whatmore, 2013: 45) that is of ﬁcially assumed and put forward.
The diversi ﬁed stream topographies supported ontological cleaving (Lavau, 2013) in the studied
cases. The ability to ﬁnd ways to move forward without a uniting nature object or restoration issue
was important. From this point of view, asking what nature is made an object of intervention (Huff
and Brock, 2023) might not be the question that should be pushed too much in common meetings orforums. Instead, as shown in the Raasepori case, it can be useful to create alternative means and
scales to become engaged while simultaneously allowing disconnectedness between publics and
nature-issues. The streams can then gain mediating capacities. In Leppioja, meanwhile, the two-stage solutions coexist along with the ‘water channels only ’apparently because public support
was speci ﬁcally available for the two-stage channels. Financial and regulatory incentives are
indeed likely to be needed to enhance the broad commitment of landowners to ecosystemValve and Valkama 2177
revitalisation. However, transforming world-making into a mere techno-economic issue would
mean that those affected by stream habitats and their potentialities, such as the restoration cham-
pions taking the restoration initiatives forward, may ﬁnd little room to articulate and foster their
sensibilities (cf. Lavau, 2013; Walker and Coles, 2022).
Conclusions
Agricultural streams bring farms and landowners together by coupling water ﬂows. This connect-
edness cannot be easily undone. However, in this paper, we have argued that ecosystem restoration
initiatives should be treated as potential reorganisers of social –material relations and that focusing
on the differentiating material publics provides a useful sensibility to analyse ecosystem restorationas a site of political and ontological work. Our analysis shows that when the agricultural streams
were discussed as issues requiring restoration and revitalisation, the multiplicity of rural landscapes
became articulated, re-enacted and consequential. At the same time, the connecting and disconnect-ing capacities of ecosystem restoration became visible.
In the studied cases, Finnish farmers could become attentive to the potential of stream habitats to
become viable ecosystems, while their neighbours showed only interest in the improved drainagefunctions of the streams. The restoration initiatives generated connectedness between farmers,
streams habitats and the restoration projects but also disconnectedness between the ‘restoration
champions ’and those sceptical about the proposed restoration approach. The disagreements
were partly articulated explicitly as disagreements about the nature-issues that restoration should
address. In addition, the experimental character of the restoration approach raised doubts. The
shared concerns and issue con ﬁgurations connected the counterpublics. The reluctance of
farmers to give interviews indicates that also our data collection became positioned into the suspi-
cious sphere.
The possibilities of the studied projects to carry out their stream revitalisation plans rested
largely on the careful speci ﬁcation of the restoration plans. The speci ﬁcation occurred along inven-
tories that enacted the streams as morphologically differentiated. The differences helped tailor the
restoration measures. The projects connected differently with different farms and publics. In add-ition, the public resources allocated to the coordination and planning of restoration could help dis-
senting farmers tolerate the measures taken. For ecosystem restoration initiatives, navigation amidst
political associations is nonetheless dif ﬁcult because there is no guarantee that the natures to be
restored or the money available will capacitate mediation in the way they did in the studied
cases. Moreover, reorganisation –and the need for alert navigation –may not end at a speci ﬁc
point but continue along restorative and exploratory practices. In any case, in ecosystem restoration
projects, the generation of mere connectedness may need to be replaced by more modest ambitions.
When the reorganisation of social –material relations is taken as an entry point, natures cannot –and
do not need to be –standardised to serve collective action. Instead, the trick is to enable ecosystem
restoration to unfold in relation to partially different natures and nature-issues.
Highlights
Ecosystem restoration projects con ﬁgure natures as restoration-requiring issues.
During project implementation, alternative issue con ﬁgurations are offered.
Ecosystem restoration may turn into a source of disconnectedness.
The studied stream restoration projects reorganised social –material relations.
Collective action could unfold in terms of different natures and nature-issues.2178 EPE: Nature and Space 7(5)
