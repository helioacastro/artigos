ABSTRACT
The quality of agriculture depends on the quality of the yield, which is usually obtained through the
well-being of the crop. The quality of any crop depends on the minerals in the soil, the type of soil, thelocation, and the seasons. The crop yield depends on soil fertility, availability of water, climate, anddisease prevention. Although this information is prevailing in plenty among the expert farmers, the
means of abducting the information to the future generation has not been much promoted. Hence,
the knowledge disseminated regarding agriculture becomes scarce, affecting the entire agriculturalprocess. Given these facts, a single source, strong knowledge management system is proposed to bedesigned. The system aims to embrace the different kinds of knowledge associated with agricultureand attempt to obtain a single source of agro information that is very much usable and reusable tothe users. To ensure the maximum level of reusability, the knowledge of the domain needs to bemodeled and represented in a way that is scalable and flexible. One of the knowledge representa-tion techniques that emphasizes on reusability and scalability is ontology. Thus, this paper attemptsto design an ontology-based agro knowledge management system. A rule base is constructed toimprove the expressiveness of the knowledge. An incremental mining approach is adopted to extractthe knowledge from multiple ontology. To understand better to aid decision-making, a visualizationtask is carried out. A multi ontology-based knowledge mining model is attempted in this research toprovide better insight regarding agro knowledge.KEYWORDS

1. INTRODUCTION
Ontology Mining is a framework for sharing and
reusing knowledge across a particular domain. Ontol-
ogy, a viable knowledge representation technique, isknown for its semantics-based processing. The onto-logical schema appears to be a useful technique forprocessing semantic data and its analysis through theservice of conceptualization. As the conceptualizationenhances the data elements through property charac-teristics, the classification and discovery of knowledgebecome very easy. The process further enables gener-ating various interpretable patterns, which would bemore helpful for future predictions. To extract usefulknowledge patterns from an ontology, several ontologymining techniques, such as w eb mining technique, nat-
ural language processing, machine learning, statistical
techniques, data mining, and knowledge representation,
a r em o s tw i d e l yu s e d .T h e s et e c h n i q u e sa r eu s e f u lt oextract different patterns of data from the represented
knowledge.
In this attempt, multiple ontologies, such as soil, loca-
tion,season,andcrop,havebeencreatedandintegrated.The objective of creating separate multiple ontologies isto ensure the multiple levels of reusability and scalabil-ity of the agro knowledge. As the representations arepracticableforincludingdataatanyinstance,theknowl-edge level tends to increase, and it may have impactthe pattern created earlier. Hence, to accept and pro-cessthegrowingdatasetfortheinferenceswithoutomit-ting the earlier detected patterns and extract the pat-tern from the different sources, incremental mining isproposed.

information systems, and exploiting the domain knowl-
edge for wide sharing. Yet, many challenges have beenassociated with the process when dealing with large,dynamicdatabases.Hence,afeasiblesolutionisexpectedto obtain by using multiple ontologies. Various studieshave been carried out in the past to confirm the effec-tiveness of ontology and mining.

Ontology development has introduced a lot of reusable
knowledge models. It provides better effectiveness insharing the information of dynamic domains. The min-ing of the ontology knowledge model generally cre-ates a pattern of facts that might be helpful for differ-ent decision-making processes, especially for a dynamicdomainlikeagriculture.
The information flow of agriculture knowledge comes

mation flow of soil mining knowledge comes with soilproperties,soilminerals,andsoilprocesses.Cropontol-ogy comes with crop type, plant anatomy, etc. Ontology
mining helps to increase the quality of entity analysis,increased use and reuse of information systems, anddomainknowledgesharing.

The input to the system ismultiple ontology, which belongs to the same domain.For experimental purposes, four ontologies are merged,and hence decreased merge cost over multiple ontol-ogy is produced. Likewise, the development of MultipleOntology Workspace Management System (MOWMS)and performance assessment were proposed by Xu et al.
[4]. The functional requirement of MOWMS consists of
userregistration,sign-upinterface,passwordencryption,service authorization, verification, ensuring users’ workwith their own workspace, SPARQL, service endpoints,configuration setting, etc.A sar e s u l t ,ap r i v a t eo n t o l -

Moreover, the recent development of ontology mining

Yueetal.[5]proposedaframeworkforvegetablesupply

In the nextstage, ontology is formalized, and in the final stage, it isexamined and evaluated for ontology construction. Asa result, information sharing and exchange among themembers of the vegetable supply chain is made.

The system is formalizedby RDF, which solves the matching reasoning of e-commerceknowledgemanagementtorealizeknowledgesharing.
Analogous to this, an ontology model of plant domain

Similarly, an application on cloud-based IoT has been
proposedbyDholu etal.[11].Thespecialtyofthisappli-

The inputs to the IoT module aresoil moisture sensor, humidity, and temperature sensor.Soil moisture is measured by YL-69 electrodes; DHT11 device measures the humidity and temperature.

An IoT platform called VegIoT for smart applications
was developed by Codeluppi et al.[12]. It deals with
the management of vegetable gardens through the col-lection, monitoring, and analysis of sensor data relatedto parameters for growing plants. The application con-sistsofagardenwirelesssensornetworkthathelpscollectdata from the field. Home node collects the data andstores it.

of the AgriD software architecture is to provide guide-

Similarly,acomparisonoffourfeaturesetsforthedetec-

Anovelvision-basedcrop-weedclassificationsystemwas
similarly developed by Lottes et al.[20]. The experi-

and the input to the classification system was taken asthe sequence of images. As a result, this system classi-fies crops in different growth stages and spatial arrange-ments of plants through stimulation. Kuang et al.[21]

Similarly, Michelon et al.[22]d e v e l o p e daw e ba p p l i -

ment of agriculture fields. The data obtained from dif-ferent sources, such as soil sample data, georeferencedimages,precipitation,fieldoperations,andthematicmap,
are taken as input. As a result, the thematic map can
help toward the correct interpretation to fertilizer appli-cation at the right place and in the necessary amountto increase the productive potential in the field. Liet al.[23]p r o p o s e dan o v e lm e t h o df o rr e c o g n i z i n g

Analogously, a low-cost resistive soil moisture sensors

An assessment of peanut pod maturity by an automated

Having created a class structure, the class is describedusing the object properties. The object property is usedto describe the relationship between the classes. Asample object property is given for illustration purposes(Table1).

3.3.1 Rule Evaluation for Agro Incremental Mining
Model
The performance of the ontology model is evaluated
by comparing the rule validation, which will bring outthe truthfulness of the model. Support, confidence, lift,conviction, and leverage are carried out for the ruleevaluation.
