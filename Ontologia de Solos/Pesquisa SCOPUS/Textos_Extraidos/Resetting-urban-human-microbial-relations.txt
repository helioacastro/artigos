Microbes, particularly of the viral kind, are currently preoc -
cupying human activity and concerns due to the COVID-
19 pandemic. Although for a long time there has been fear 
associated with ‘germs’, notably viruses and bacteria and 
the diseases they cause, the pandemic has set these fears 
into overdrive. As serious as this ongoing event is, there are 
broader interests and important alternative narratives about 
the microbial world permeating current thinking, based on 
research that intersects with and includes biopolitical and 
relational research in geography. In an attempt at balancing 
the prevailingly negative discourses about microbes and the 
potential harms they can cause, and to encourage more geog -
raphers to contribute to understanding human-microbial 
relations, this paper draws together recent research across 
disciplines to discuss the prevalence and role of microbes 
in environments and in and on human bodies. Drawing on 
ideas of more-than-human care, the paper shows how geog -
raphers and other social scientists can and are already help -
ing reset human-microbial relations, and where further work 
can productively be done.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Perhaps now more than ever, microbes are front and centre in human consciousness. Almost every aspect of our 
lived experience is changing dramatically as we seek to render the uncontrollable, controllable through rapidly 
changing practices of health, hygiene, working, studying, travelling and relating to others (Biedermann,  2020 ; 
Caroppo et  al., 2021 ; Kramer & Kramer,  2020 ). First seen under microscopes by English and Dutch scientists, 
Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, in the 17th Century (Gest,  2004 ), microbes are microscopic organ -
isms that include bacteria, fungi, viruses and single-celled creatures such as protozoa (Ishaq et  al., 2019 ). Although 
antibiotics to treat bacterial infections are commonly thought to have been invented in the early 20 th Century, 
evidence shows that for millennia humans have treated bacterial infections using treatments from soil and plants 
(Aminov,  2010 ).
Viruses are the smallest microbe and because they cannot multiply without the cells of other living organisms, 
they are essentially considered a microbial parasite (Villarreal,  2004 ). Since early 2020, the world has been grappling 
with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2), such that ‘we [have] become increasingly alert to ways in which invisible entities’ enter human bodies 
and causing damage to organs, immune systems and lives (Biedermann,  2020 , p. 1). Aside from the immunologists and 
other scientists seeking to understand COVID-19 and end the pandemic, the worlds humans share with viruses and 
other microbes were already receiving increased attention in diverse disciplines, including biology (e.g., Davenport 
et al., 2017 ), ecology (e.g., Mills et  al., 2017 ), built environment studies (e.g., Adams et  al., 2016 ), public health (e.g., 
O'Doherty et  al., 2016 ), and geography (Beck,  2021 ; Greenhough,  2012 ; Hird,  2009 ; Lorimer,  2020 ; Maller,  2018 ). 
This increasing interest is reflected in other recent ‘turns’ in the social sciences, including in new materialisms and 
more-than-human theories (e.g., Bennett,  2010 ; Coole & Frost,  2010 ; Haraway,  2008 ; Maller,  2018 ), which draw 
uncritically  from Indigenous ontologies (Porter et  al., 2020 ).
Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the level of scholarly interest in microbes across disciplines is partly due 
to the expansion of research into microbiomes. ‘Microbiome’ refers to the community of micro-organisms and their 
genetic material found in any given environment (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ), whether in soil, on animal bodies, or 
inside the human gut. One of the most well-known studies is the Human Microbiome Project (Turnbaugh et  al., 2007 ). 
Following work mapping the human genome, this project aimed to understand the millions of microbiota contributing 
to and constituting human bodies and the role they play in evolution (Turnbaugh et  al., 2007 ). Rather than simply 
a collection of microbes that happen to co-occur, microbiomes are relational; that is, they refer to the relationships 
microbes have with each other, with macro species, and with their environments, whether that be in the soil or on a 
human body.
An unavoidable fact from microbiomic studies is that we now know microbes inhabit and are vital to every 
habitat, and are essential to most organisms. Yong  (2016 , p. 53) summarises key conclusions, noting ‘it is now clear 
that many animals, from fish to mice, grow up under the influence of bacterial partners.’ The findings of research 
into microbiomes, microorganisms and their multi-species relationships, regularly feature in the media. Although 
articles often concern gut microbiota and their human health impacts (e.g., Seal,  2021 ), other innovations are gain -
ing attention. These include stories about fueling  microbes  with  solar power and carbon dioxide to produce food 
(Carrington,  2021 ), microbes inhabiting (Amaral-Zettler et  al., 2013 ) and eating plastic (Carpenter,  2021 ), and microbes 
that can potentially cure disease (Zimmer,  2018 ) through measures such as faecal transplants (Shepherd,  2022 ) and 
microscopic projectiles that target cancer using magnets constructed by soil bacteria (McKie,  2022 ). Partially explain -
ing this phenomenon, Yong  (2016 , p. 249) observes, ‘only recently have [microbes] migrated from the neglected 
fringes of biology to its spotlight-hogging centre.’ In short, these developments are changing our view of microbes 
such that we are better understanding their potential harms, such as from viruses, but also the myriad benefits, omni -
presence, and the fundamental reliance all life has upon them. What has also become abundantly clear is that despite 
prevailing fears, only a very small number of microbes are harmful to people (Greenhough et  al., 2018 ; Yong,  2016 ). In 
fact, human pathogens including viruses amount to less than 1% of all microbial species (Editorial,  2011 ). Particularly

pertinent to pandemics, Lorimer  (2017 , p. 553) argues, ‘no microbe is essentially pathogenic; pathogenesis is the 
outcome of political and ecological relations’.
This rising ‘microbial’ (Greenhough et  al., 2020 ) or ‘probiotic’ turn (Lorimer,  2019 , 2020 ) enables thinking about 
microbes in numerous ways of further interest to geographers. The contributions geographers have already made 
to this topic include: understanding the mobilities, networks, borderlands and materialities of pathogens (Ali & 
Keil, 2007 ; Greenhough,  2012 ; Hinchliffe et  al., 2013 ; Lorimer,  2017 ); showcasing human-microbial relations of the 
gut (Beck,  2021 ; Lorimer,  2016 ) and soil (Krzywoszynska,  2019 ); revealing domestic microbiomes and their multispe -
cies relations in kitchens (Greenhough et  al., 2018 ) and elsewhere in homes (Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 , 2020 ); 
and the biopolitics of multispecies encounters in an era of widespread climatic change (Clark & Hird,  2018 ). As well 
as temporal and spatial understandings that geographers are so well-placed to address, much of what is compel -
ling  about microbes is relational and political; in other words the ‘microbiopolitics’ (Paxson,  2008 ).
With the COVID-19 pandemic bringing all microbes and their relations to humans and other species into sharper 
focus, particularly in urban settings, there is a need and an opportunity for geographers and other social scientists to 
contribute further to growing scholarship and practice (see also Greenhough et  al., 2020 ). This paper aims to briefly 
review current research on microbiomes from a range of disciplines to encourage further active engagement with 
microbial ecologies, relations and their microbiopolitics. I focus the discussion on urban human-microbial relations 
and microbiomes because most people now live in urban environments (United Nations General Assembly, 2016 ). 
Before COVID-19, the health and wellbeing of people living in cities was evident in multiple urban policy agendas, 
including the UN's New Urban Agenda (United Nations General Assembly, 2016 ). Relatedly, research and policy -
making on urban greening and nature in cities has exploded, including on microbes (Flies et  al., 2017 ; Robinson 
et al., 2020 ). In the sections that follow, there is an unashamedly affirmative lens given to human-microbial relations 
(Hinchliffe et  al., 2013 ) that reflects this work and serves as a juxtaposition to the pervasive antimicrobial view that 
is only likely to be further entrenched by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Microbiomes are relational, multiple and complex. Their boundaries are ill-defined and permeable and when 
they are determined, they are arguably artificial if one takes a purely relational perspective (Hinchliffe et  al., 2013 ). 
Yet boundaries and limits are at times factual and necessary, whilst also largely being unavoidable, in research and 
the production of knowledge. Acknowledging the potentially false separation, I have chosen two broad groupings of 
microbiomes to structure the main parts of this paper: environmental microbiomes, including in indoor and outdoor 
environments, and the microbiomes of human bodies. These two broad settings also work to focus attention on 
human-microbial relations from an urban, spatial, material perspective for the reasons provided above. The third 
section draws on ideas of more-than-human care to show how human-microbial relations can be further assisted in 
moving beyond their largely negative reputations. The final section concludes the paper, suggesting future directions 
for social and other geographic research.
2 | ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOMES
This section concerns environmental microbiomes that generally occur as part of urban environments; in other words, 
microbes and their communities found in outdoor and indoor settings in cities. However, it is important to recognise 
that microbial communities don't adhere to spatial and temporal boundaries with mobilities and exchanges occurring 
between rural and urban environments (Douglas,  2008 ; Spotswood et  al., 2021 ), outdoor and indoor environments, 
and inside and outside bodies (Robinson et  al., 2020 ), among other boundary-crossings (Hinchliffe et  al., 2013 ).
In the literature, environmental microbiomes are divided into zones with different microbial communities found 
in soil, on vegetation, in the air (the ‘aerobiome’) (Robinson et  al., 2020 ), in fresh and salt water, and in and on build -
ings and their surfaces and contents (Leung & Lee,  2016 ; Wakefield-Rann,  2021 ). One of the easiest environmental 
microbiomes to contemplate is the soil microbiome with its granular materiality making it more readily ‘visible’. But 
there is, of course, much more to soil that is not so readily visible; as Puig de la Bellacasa writes, ‘a billion bacteria,

thousands of fungi, protozoa and nematodes live in a teaspoon of rich soil’ ( 2019 , p. 394). As well as this, urban soils 
can be laced with ‘rubbish, decay [and]… toxic residues’ (Robertson,  2020 , p. 319). Chemicals interact with microbes, 
subsequently changing the composition of microbial communities (Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 ), in turn changing 
soil acidity (Douglas,  2008 ). Environmental microbiomes also interact with and influence one another over differ -
ent  strata. For example, vegetation and soil contribute to airborne microbiota (Robinson et  al., 2020 ).
In ecology, high levels of biodiversity indicate resilient ecosystems and are important for the long-term survival 
and adaptability of species and ecological communities. Biodiversity is literally a life-support system comprised of 
diverse genetic resources and relationships (Douglas,  2008 ; Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ). Like all ecosystems, biodi -
versity is equally important for microbiomes, whether in the environment or in or on human bodies; the more diverse 
they are, the more resilient and adaptive they are to shocks and threats (Douglas,  2008 ; Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ), 
including to viruses and other pathogens.
The ‘biodiversity hypothesis’ proposes that the low microbial diversity of urban settings has poor outcomes for 
human health due to an absence of certain microbes (Flies et  al., 2017 ; Mills et  al., 2017 ) (see also the following 
section). In response, Mills et  al. (2017 , p. 2) have proposed the ‘microbiome rewilding hypothesis’ that contends 
increasing biodiversity in urban greenspaces ‘can rewild the environmental microbiome to a state that benefits human 
health by primary prevention’. ‘Rewilding’ 1 in this context, as defined by Western  scientists, refers to increasing the 
biodiversity of microbes in urban environments to reverse the negative impacts urbanisation has had on underlying 
ecosystems. Robinson et  al. (2020 )) and Flies et  al. (2017 ) explain that, despite a need for further research, microbi -
omes should be considered a part of health promoting, biodiverse green infrastructure to increase the diversity of 
human microbiomes, which in the long term can suppress inflammation and reduce chronic disease. This research 
puts a different spin on ideas about the benefits of contact with nature (Myers,  2019 ), and leads to questions of the 
temporal, spatial, political, affective, and material nature of environments that geographers are familiar with.
Just as there are microbiomes outdoors, there are microbiomes indoors. Microbes inside and on buildings are 
associated with flows of air, water, food, surfaces, dust, artefacts, clothes, technologies, chemicals, plants, and human 
and other animal bodies (Meadow et  al., 2015 ; Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 ). Indoor microbiomes are primarily influ -
enced by outdoor microbiomes and those on human bodies, mediated by building design, ventilation, occupancy 
levels and activities (Leung & Lee,  2016 ). Aside from microbes transferred to interior surfaces by touch and move -
ment, human bioaerosols (airborne biological particles including bacteria and bacteria-laden particles) are considered 
a major contributor to indoor microbiomes (Meadow et  al., 2015 ). New research is showing that people occupying 
indoor spaces emit distinguishable personal microbial clouds (Meadow et  al., 2015 ), with estimates of particles emit -
ted of 10 6/hour (You et  al., 2013 ). Yong  (2016 , p. 251) explains, ‘every time we talk, talk, scratch, shuffle or sneeze 
we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space’, meaning ‘that our microbiome isn't’ confined to our bodies. It 
perpetually reaches out into our environment.’ As well humans transferring and aerosolising microbes indoors, stud -
ies show indoor airborne microbes reciprocate by contributing to our nasal, oral, and skin microbiomes (Robinson 
et al., 2020 ). Rooms with different uses and users are also being found to have different microbial ecologies that are 
linked to different parts of human skin, gut and oral microbiomes (Leung & Lee,  2016 ).
There are two main ways the composition of indoor microbiomes is actively mediated: (1) through ventilation and 
filtering of air flows, and (2) the use of chemicals and cleaning products on surfaces. With the rise of urbanisation, 
considerable effort has sought to maintain comfortable, controllable indoor air temperatures and movement of air 
through energy efficiency measures such as draught-proofing (McLauchlan et  al., 2017 ; Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 ), 
passive heating and cooling (Sarihi et  al., 2021 ), and air conditioning (Winter  2013 ). Different temperatures and 
ventilation modes change the characteristics and composition of indoor microbiomes, with naturally ventilated rooms 
having more in common with outdoor aerobiomes than mechanically ventilated rooms (Leung & Lee,  2016 ). As well 
as bringing in microbes from outdoors, ventilation practices can also flush out chemicals such as volatile organic 
compounds, which in turn can also shape microbial ecologies (Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 , 2020 ). Meanwhile, 
draught-proofing and other sustainability initiatives have meant new and retrofitted buildings have become highly 
sealed, limiting the transfer of microbially diverse, ‘clean’ air from outside to inside as an unintended consequence.

Most efforts in manipulating indoor microbial communities through surface cleaning are focused on elimination. 
Blanket ‘kill’ strategies aim to eradicate every single microbe, whether potentially beneficial or harmful. This reduces 
microbial diversity and changes microbial ecologies when sterilised surfaces are colonised by whichever microbes 
happen to be in the vicinity (Yong,  2016 ). The pervasive germ phobia that characterises modernity has been described 
as an ‘antibiotic, antimicrobial worldview’ or an ‘antibiosis discourse’ (Greenhough et  al., 2018 , p. 2) that is harmful 
not only to humans (Doron & Broom,  2019 ), but to the world's ecosystems and other species (Lorimer,  2020 ) through 
the overuse of chemicals and the production and consumption of cleaning products. Aside from reducing exposure 
to diverse microbiomes, any chemicals used in cleaning interact with microbes in ways that are not well understood 
(Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 , 2020 ). The same applies to chemicals used in the manufacture of indoor furniture and 
furnishings which also interact with microbes and change indoor microbiomes (Wakefield-Rann et  al., 2018 ). The 
proliferation of built structures and technologies via urbanisation, the production and expanding use of chemicals 
in workplaces and homes, and globally connected and changing practices of everyday life, are essentially creating 
myriad, novel ecosystems at the microbial level (Broom et  al., 2021 ; Douglas,  2008 ; Lorimer,  2017 ; Wakefield-Rann 
et al., 2018 ). The cumulative impacts on human health and the broader ecological implications are currently unknown 
and are probably unknowable. What is known, is that these microbial communities are nothing like those humans 
have evolved with (discussed further in the following section). However, research shows some of the ways urbani -
sation changes microbiomes and can enhance the spread of pathogens is through ‘antimicrobial resistance, land-use 
change and overcrowded populations’ (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 , p. 340).
Inside buildings, typically, the idea has been to keep microbes out (Yong,  2016 ). Yet the COVID-19 pandemic is 
forcing a rethink of how we live, study and work, focusing on occupancy densities and building ventilation, with higher 
air circulation rates likely to be implemented in future policies and building designs. Although the concept is to reduce 
the concentration of pathogens in indoor air, as a corollary, increasing flows of outside air will also bring in diverse, 
outdoor microbes that result in higher microbial diversity in and on human bodies, enhancing resilience to disease. 
As Yong  (2016 , p. 258) writes, ‘rather than trying to exclude microbes from our buildings and public spaces, perhaps 
it is time to lay the welcome mat out for them.’ He reiterates that architectural design choices affect the microbial 
communities of buildings, ‘which could then affect the microbial ecology of us’ (Yong,  2016 , p. 258), in either a posi -
tive or negative way, remembering Lorimer's point that no microbe is essentially pathogenic (Lorimer,  2017 , p. 544). 
It seems sensible then to extend the microbiome ‘rewilding’ hypothesis posited for outdoor environments by Mills 
et al. (2017 ), to the ‘rewilding’ of buildings and indoor environments. This is already happening, by default in some 
ways, with the rising popularity of green walls, roofs and other vegetated infrastructure of the built environment 
(Coutts & Hahn,  2015 ; Loder,  2014 ); however, the changes to indoor microbiomes, and subsequently human micro -
biomes and the impacts on physical and mental health, is yet to be understood. What is probable, however, is that 
when indoors, people are more likely to be experiencing impoverished environmental microbiomes, or alternatively, 
those with novel ecologies. The next section takes a closer look at the microbiomes associated with human bodies 
and their impacts on health and wellbeing.
3 | THE MICROBIOMES OF HUMAN BODIES
Scholars as diverse as Yong  (2016 ), Bennett  (2010 ), Mol  (2002 ), Hird  (2009 ) and Haraway  (2008 , 2016 ) assert that 
humans are, literally, never just one body. Microbiology supports these assertions; there are ten times more microor -
ganisms in an average human body than there are human cells (Lorimer,  2016 ; Turnbaugh et  al., 2007 ; Yong,  2016 ). 
Human bodies are essentially immersed in and comprised of microbes that become part of who we are, including in 
our eyes, noses and guts (Robinson et  al., 2020 ; Turnbaugh et  al., 2007 ). In fact, humans have different microbiomes 
on different parts and sites of our bodies; so the microbiota on each hand, on our faces, and in mouths or guts are 
different and they change as our bodies grow and age (Huang et  al., 2020 ). Microbes perform or support a range of 
‘obscenely complicated’ bodily functions including, ‘replenishing the linings of the gut and skin, replacing damaged

and dying cells with new ones’, maintaining the blood-brain barrier, and training and driving our immune system 
(Yong,  2016 , p. 63). They also produce vitamins we do not have the genes to make, break down food in the gut to 
extract nutrients, and teach immune systems how to recognise invaders (Yong,  2016 ). In other roles, microbiota 
regulate drug metabolism and may even influence risk taking and psychomotor skills (Flegr,  2007 ). Relatedly, the 
brain-body system and neurological health is also increasingly understood to be supported by microbes, based on 
connections between environmental and human microbiomes (Leung & Lee,  2016 ; Myers,  2019 ). Research is ongo -
ing, with Davenport et  al. (2017 , p. 1) stating ‘we are in the midst of a revolution  in our understanding of the human 
microbiome’ [emphasis added].
Because microbiomes are essential to many aspects of being human they are framed by social scientists a 
vital parts of assemblages of more-than-human bodies. Humans are therefore ‘superorganisms’ (Greenhough 
et al., 2018 , p. 2), with ‘being human [labelled]… a multispecies achievement, dependent on the “corporeal generosity” 
of microbial life’ (Lorimer,  2016 , p. 58). However, any discussion of human-microbial relationality cannot ignore the 
relational ontologies, sovereignties, and scholarship of Indigenous peoples without risking  appropriation and erasure 
(Porter et  al., 2020 ; Tallbear,  2011 ; Todd,  2016 ; Watts,  2013 ). Further, considering more-than-human  thinking  and 
kin relations and ontologies, Indigenous, Black, Queer and feminist scholars are  leading the way in renewed  discus -
sions of relationality (Benezra,  2022 ; Tallbear,  2011 ). While simultaneously reclaiming relational concepts such as 
kin (e.g., Kanngieser & Todd,  2020 ), they are showing how microbes ‘take up new (old) kinship formulations … [as] 
oddkin, chemical kin, cohort kin, environmental kin, situated kin  [and] Land/body relations’  while  arguing  for rela -
tional accountability (Benezra,  2022 , p. 512).
Benezra  (2020 , p. 828) also writes about the problematic absence/presence of race in human microbiome 
research: ‘Race becomes a ghost in the scientific work, an invisible, powerful informant that affects the categorization 
of bodies, how difference is scientifically made and verified, and ultimately how interventions and care are applied.’ 
Microbiome research skates on a thin edge if it unproblematically characterises certain human communities or indi -
viduals as having microbial relations based on racial profiles and/or other lines of differentiation such as disability, 
gender or sexuality. As Benezra  (2022 , p. 512) argues, there is ‘a pressing need to decolonize ontological studies of 
nonhumans, particularly microbes’ because of their association with disease and abnormality.
Since most animal-microbial relations are beneficial, symbiotic, or neutral rather than harmful (Greenhough 
et al., 2018 ; Haraway,  2016 ; Yong,  2016 ), terms such as the ‘holobiont’ 2 have been used to capture the idea that 
humans and other animals, along with their microbiomes, are always multispecies communities rather than individ -
ual organisms (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ). The idea of beneficial human-microbial relations formed through long 
evolutionary associations between people and specific microbiota has been called ‘the old friends’ hypothesis' (Flies 
et al., 2017 ; Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ). However, since germ theory emerged in the mid-1800s, the focus has 
been on the negative impacts of microorganisms (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ).
More recently, Robinson and Jorgensen  (2020 , p. 340) observe, ‘the potentially vital role that symbiotic envi -
ronmental microorganisms play in regulating our health has been neglected’. For example, Flies et  al. (2017 ) discuss 
how urban humans have been found to have less diverse gut microbiomes, concluding, as have the World Health 
Organisation, that it is increasingly clear a diverse microbiome is essential to human health (WHO & SCBD,  2015 ). 
This conclusion has direct implications for further problematising the uneven distribution of wealth in cities where 
poorer neighbourhoods will have less diverse and possibly harmful microbiomes compared to wealthier areas. The 
absence or low biodiversity of microbes in environments and bodies is beginning to be associated with many largely 
non-communicable diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer's, inflammatory bowel and skin diseases, obesity, 
allergies, and depression (see Robinson et  al. (2020 ), Lorimer  (2017 ), Mills et  al. (2017 ; Myers,  2019 )). The connection 
between environmental and human microbiomes is so strong that environments are now considered to be more 
important than human genetics in shaping gut microbiomes (Robinson et  al., 2020 ).
Although the concept remains controversial (Lorimer,  2017 ; Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 ), the idea of ‘dysbiosis’ 
has been used to explain the correlation between non-communicable diseases and urban living. Dysbiosis, ‘or “life in 
distress” is considered by some researchers to manifest as an imbalance in the microbial assemblages in the human

body to a state that is detrimental to health’ (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 , p. 340). These imbalances can be due to 
the absence of some microbes (‘old friends’), the presence of others that may be pathogenic, and the complex rela -
tions within and between microbiomes and their human hosts (Lorimer,  2017 ) in the built environment. For example, 
Leung and Lee  (2016 ) discuss a recent review that suggests occupant's mental wellbeing could be improved by reduc -
ing exposure to numerous bacterial and fungal species often found indoors.
The rising incidences of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases (Hodgetts et  al., 2018 ), converging with the 
increasing knowledge about the benefits of microbes means that the treatment of dysbiotic conditions may be about 
to dramatically improve. Yong  (2016 , p. 215) reports that ‘microbiome manipulators… are developing cocktails of 
beneficial microbes’ that can be consumed to correct dysbiosis and prevent illness, as well as transplanting entire 
[microbial] communities from one individual to another.’ Using Haraway's concept of companion species, Beck  (2021 ) 
studied participants' experiences of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). She found that FMT users described 
‘how they became observant to how the microbiome expressed itself through bodily functions and what these 
expressions felt like as a form of communication; a heightened bodily sense … [or] a corporeal dialogue, where the 
bodily sensations are observed with an increased awareness’ (Beck,  2021 , p. 368).
Across ecosystems as well as human bodies, Lorimer  (2020 ) discusses these ideas in detail in his book, ‘Probiotic 
Planet: Using Life to Manage Life’. New knowledge about microbes, the invention of technologies to manipulate them, 
consumption and land use change mean, ‘the interactions between human, viral, animal, and technological bodies are 
becoming more and more intense’ (Bennett,  2010 , p. 108). It also means that it is ‘becoming increasing [ly] hard to hold 
human life apart from materiality and to deny agency to all forms of life except humans’ (Greenhough,  2010 , p. 37). 
Multispecies problems such as pandemics and the acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (Doron & Broom,  2019 ) 
indicate there is an urgent need to develop a broader, relational understanding of human-microbial relationships.
4 | MORE-THAN-HUMAN CARE TO RESET HUMAN-MICROBIAL RELATIONS
One first step to reset human-microbial relations is try to make microbes more ‘visible’ or ‘relatable’, to allow new 
(old) ways of ‘thinking-with’ and thinking-through microbes to emerge (Hird,  2009 ). Although geographic and cognate 
literature has brought attention to various, numerous human-non-human relations that are taken for granted, there is 
a bias toward visible, more relatable, macroorganisms (Greenhough et  al., 2018 ; Tallbear,  2011 ) (e.g., Hitchings,  2003 ; 
Philo,  1995 ; Power,  2012 ). Taking note of this imbalance, invisible lifeforms and elements of various kinds have been 
receiving growing consideration from geographers examining finer scales of more-than-human and multispecies 
assemblages, including those working with Indigenous ontologies (e.g., Barker,  2010 ; Bawaka Country et  al., 2015 ; 
Krzywoszynska,  2019 ; Lorimer,  2020 ; Robertson,  2020 ; Tynan,  2021 ), and when such relations become pathogenic 
(e.g., Graham,  2015 ; Greenhough,  2012 ; Hinchliffe,  2015 ; Hinchliffe et  al., 2013 ; Lorimer,  2017 ). In terms of affirma -
tive microbiopolitics, the work of Puig de la Bellacasa (Puig de la Bellacasa,  2017 , 2019 ) on soils has also been influ -
ential in drawing attention to working at different, generally smaller, scales. As she explains ‘what soils are conceived 
to be, visions and concepts of soil, will affect the ways they are cared for’ (Puig de la Bellacasa,  2019 , p. 393). Applied 
to microbes and microbiomes, how they are conceptualised determines how we treat, respond to, and care for them. 
Puig de la Bellacasa's  (2019 ) position on visibility is that ‘making them visible, come [s] with a message: knowing soils 
better could enable better care.’ One way of achieving greater visibility is through ‘envisioning’, encouraging famili -
arity with the teeming forms of microbial life via art-science collaborations (Puig de la Bellacasa,  2019 ). The idea is 
that using art and visual media to zoom in and illuminate microscopic scales will evoke new affects and make the 
liveliness of microbes more real through representational visibility (Puig de la Bellacasa,  2019 ). The idea of making 
microbes more visible is echoed in the work of several other scholars. In referring to the greater availability of DNA 
sequencing for use in homes and workplaces Hodgetts et  al. (2018 , p. 8), state that, ‘the social sciences and human -
ities can help to map public understandings of microbes and to enable the collaborative development of new ways 
of seeing the microbial world.’ Robinson and Jorgensen  (2020 , p. 345) propose that, ‘technologies and disciplines

can now be combined to gain a better understanding of the structure, distribution, and functional roles and relation -
ships of microbial communities within and across different landscapes.’ In proposing a new field of microbioscape 
research, 3 they suggest further that it ‘could also be applied to incorporate other perspectives such as new material -
ism’ (Robinson & Jorgensen,  2020 , p. 340).
Along these lines, Hird  (2009 , p. 1) puts forward the notion of ‘microontologies’, which she describes as referring 
‘to a microbial ethics, or  … an ethics that engages seriously with the microcosmos.’ Puig de la Bellacasa  (2019 , p. 396) 
explains further that we need to find the ‘everydayness by which humans and non-humans are engaged in intensi -
fying intimate entanglements of ecological care’. Care has a particular interpretation in this work as a non-normative 
obligation, as a ‘more than an affective-ethical state: it involves material engagement in labours to sustain interde -
pendent worlds’ (Puig de la Bellacasa,  2012 , p. 198). Originating  from Indigneous ontologies, this sentiment  is echoed 
in geographical literature on care (e.g., Bawaka Country et  al., 2013 ; Greenhough,  2011 ; Houston et  al., 2018 ; Power 
& Williams,  2020 ; Tynan,  2021 ). However, perhaps what distinguishes microbial relations from other multispecies 
relationships is their essential nature; we arguably need them more than they need us (Beck,  2021 ).
Beck  (2021 , p. 372) advocates for paying more attention to bodies and their multispecies relations via corpo -
real communication such that we can ‘take back our personhood in relation to the nonhuman within us’. Her work 
with participants having FMT showed how other affects, senses and sensations other than vision are enrolled in 
understanding the very personal human-microbial relations at play in digestion. A more open sensory and affective 
approach, rather than only making microbes visible, involves noting what some might feel, smell and taste like. But 
beyond human bodily interactions with microbes, caring for and with broader microbial relations in urban environ -
ments is a way of scaling up to reveal other more-than-human relations; in this sense, microbes or microbiomes could 
be ‘a facilitator … rather than the object’ (Greenhough et  al., 2018 , p. 8).
To conclude, in the final section  I reflect on the ideas discussed earlier in the paper to frame future research 
directions in light of current global challenges.
5 | FUTURE GEOGRAPHIC RESEARCH ON HUMAN-MICROBIAL RELATIONS
Although the simplicity of casting microbes in black and white, binary terms, such as ‘pathogenic’ or ‘beneficial’ is 
appealing, it produces an enormous disservice to human and non-human life through the dismantling and reduction 
of multifaceted and lively relations to homogenisation and individualisation, neutralising power structures, and ignor -
ing multiple forms of vulnerability. As geographers and other scholars are already doing, there is a need to continue 
to reach out across disciplines and specialisations to pursue lines of enquiry that are relational and ethical, following 
‘the knots of relating through which human actors and their more-than-human counterparts mutually construct one 
another’ (Clark & Hird,  2018 , p. 18). The productive work involved in the reconceptualisation of human-microbial 
relations is key here, in light of what Mol  (2002  p. vii) refers to as ‘ontological politics’, where concepts, language and 
framing can determine ‘the way in which problems are framed, bodies are shaped, and lives are pushed and pulled 
into one shape or another’.
The pandemic will no doubt spur on future research on microbes and microbiomes, but based on the material 
discussed in this  paper there are three clear, not necessarily discrete, ways geography and geographers can produc -
tively continue to contribute:
1.  Working with scholars of relational and critical theories.  Acknowledging the work that has already been done, 
there is further scope for geographers to work with and learn from feminist, post-colonial, and other critical 
theorists to analyse whose bodies are or are not normalised or pathologised in microbiome research and what 
this means for decolonisation and the achievement of social and ecological justice. Without such critical takes, 
problematic associations are likely to continue to be made between certain health states  and particular races, 
abilities, and genders, leading to potentially perverse and/or harmful outcomes in the sharing of knowledge about

microbial relations. Beyond this, there is further work and learning to be done in understanding how to live 
ethically with microbiomes through ideas of kinship and biosociality. The relational scholarship of Indigenous, 
Black and Queer geographers, along with those from cognate fields, is already leading these applications (e.g., 
Kanngieser & Todd,  2020 ; Lobo,  2019 ; Tuck et  al., 2022 ; Tynan,  2021 ). There is an ethical responsibility from 
other scholars writing on microbes and microbiomes to listen to and elevate these voices through citational and 
other research practices. Collectively, this work will be invaluable in guiding and critiquing the future directions of, 
and new knowledge generated by, human microbiome and related research and the disciplines and technologies 
supporting and enabling it.
2.  The study of the settings and practices of everyday life and their various sociomaterial complexities.  Geogra -
phers have made substantial contributions to understanding the routines, experiences and impacts of everyday 
life, and there is ample opportunity to give further attention to detailed human-microbial relations embroiled in 
daily routines as it takes place in (and on the surfaces of) homes, workplaces, educational and other institutions, 
and more broadly in urban environments, including in soil, air and as part of complex relations and ecologies with 
plants and other animals. Research to date has concentrated on human gut-microbial, and to a lesser extent, 
respiratory, relations; but as the discussions in this paper illustrate, there are many more ways microbes and 
humans are entangled in an everyday sense, literally, including the novel ecologies in the buildings we inhabit 
and with the foods, chemicals and other products that we use and consume, our contact with each other, and 
contact with other macro  species. Exposure to microbial ecologies is mediated through the quality, safety, and 
functionality of the built and other environments we occupy and share. With a suite of methodologies and meth -
ods available to them, geographers are ideally placed to study and understand how modification of the design 
and use of urban environments post-COVID-19, in light of heightened concerns about cleanliness and a rejuve -
nated fear of microbes, changes everyday practices and vice versa. This could follow on from recent work about 
ventilation practices (Hitchings & Lee,  2008 ; Shove et  al., 2014 ), coping with heat (Oppermann et  al., 2018 ), adap -
tation to weather (de Vet,  2013 ; Wright & Tofa,  2021 ) and the comforts and discomforts of living life outdoors 
(Hitchings,  2021 ).
3.  The spatial, temporal, and affective dimensions of multispecies-microbial relations.  Microbes are (and are being) 
enrolled in multifaceted, globally relevant problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, waste management, 
and technological human health advances such as FMT and cancer treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic will also 
generate a renewed interest in their mobility, circulation and flow in local and global networks, extending the 
work of Clark and Hird  (2018 ) and Ali and Keil  (2007 ). Concerns about future pandemics and the identification 
of potentially harmful viruses and bacteria provides a compelling narrative sustaining binary conceptualisations 
of microbes that are ‘good/bad’, or ‘beneficial/pathogenic’. Geographers have an important role in continuing 
to develop more nuanced understandings of the complex spatial, temporal, scalar, and affective dimensions of 
human-microbial and other multispecies relations to shift narratives away from binaries to focus on relations 
that are specific to space and time, their dynamics and mobility. In the context of urban greening and ‘rewilding’ 
agendas, there are also opportunities to further understand the impacts of colonisation and the inherent urban 
inequalities from a microbiomic perspective, including how impoverished, toxic or otherwise unhealthy microbial 
environments are distributed and maintained in cities, who is most impacted by them, and how they can be 
remediated.
Using a microbial lens, this paper has shown that the intensity of human-environment relations are much greater, 
more detailed, and more omnipresent, than is currently  accepted. As knowledge of microbes and microbiomes 
increases, it will further illuminate and politicise the complexities of microbial and multi-scalar ecologies, and how 
these are vulnerable to, and implicated in, the global challenges affecting all life, nominally the extinction crisis and 
climate change (Díaz et  al., 2019 ; Karki et  al., 2018 ). Pertinent is the fact that only a tiny fraction of microbes is 
currently identified. Meanwhile, the melting of polar icesheets and glaciers caused by climate change is reanimating 
microbes from previous geological epochs who are (re)entering ecosystems that have not encountered them for

millennia, or ever (Clark & Hird,  2018 ). But rather than a broad-brush approach, what might now be most valuable is 
the disaggregation of microbial genera (and species) in various settings and practices such that different relationships 
with viruses, fungi, bacteria, algae and protozoa can be better understood and, arguably, cared for.
Just as Robinson and Jorgensen  (2020 ) argue that landscape researchers can make an important contribution 
towards rekindling old friendships between humans and microbiota, this paper has contended  that geographers 
and other social scientists also have much more to offer resetting human-microbial relations. Ultimately, geographic 
contributions of many kinds are urgently needed to ensure an enduring and damaging antimicrobial stance is not the 
sting in the tail from the COVID-19 pandemic.
