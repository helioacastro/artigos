ABSTRACT
Care is a political and ethical everyday practice with nested pro-
cesses and relationships. In more-than-human design, care is a
practice that allows a deep engagement with time and temporality.
Existing terms such as caring forandabout fall short in accounting
for this engagement by not bringing to the fore the diverse tempo-
ral frames embedded in care relations and the fluidity of agency
between caregiver and receiver roles. This paper provides a typol-
ogy informed by different kinds of care based on engagement with
time and labor, such as caring for,about , and through . Specifically,
we contribute caring through as a concept emphasizing the role
of more-than-human temporality in care practice. Caring through
accounts for plural engagements with time, the interdependence
between caregiver and care receiver, and mediated aspects of care
where care becomes making time for the other.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3686169.3686211These are practices that involve attention and commitment to re-
spond to needs [ 37] and acts that promote the well-being of others
and ourselves based on the responsiveness to the cared-for [ 15]. Re-
cently, care as a broader activity encompassing more-than-human
(MtH) entities such as animals, insects, plants, waters, soil, and
microorganisms are becoming more important. Scholars call for
more-than-human inclusion in the discourse [ 9,14] to acknowledge
all we do for more-than-human worlds, which necessitates care.
Through care, we attune to the Earth and become responsive to-
ward its myriad beings, living or non-living, with whom we cohabit
space and time.
HCI and design have taken a natural interest in care as disci-
plines responding to challenges arising from a ‘lack of care’ for the
environment, such as climate change and environmental injustices.
Care is seen in design research as a sensibility and practice with
which we repair, regenerate, and restore more-than-human worlds
[56]. Noteworthy examples include the design of care practices
towards more-than-human entities such as living (e.g., silkworms,
bacteria) and non-living beings (e.g., objects, tools) [ 21,42,51,60],
the design practice becoming a way to care [ 28], care as a design
ethic [ 23,24,52], and care as a moral stance [ 2,16], with which we
design tools, systems, and artifacts [29, 57].
Care is an ever-encompassing activity surrounding the design
practice, and the ambivalence of care can make it challenging to
decide what counts as care and who needs to be cared for. As tra-
ditional understandings (e.g., health care, tending to the elderly,
and children) evolve into the emerging discourse around more-
than-human care, there is a risk of care becoming a buzzword used
without a nuanced understanding. We believe such an understand-
ing can help researchers carefully andattentively find opportunities
to relate to more-than-human worlds and to build relationships
with more-than-human entities.
To promote such understanding, we provide a typology of care,
addressing time and labor-related aspects. Not all care involves
practical work towards the cared for; it can also refer to someone’s
positioning and emotional involvement. We believe different types
of care (i.e., caring about, for, with, and through) can unravel the
dynamic relationship between caregiver and receiver and reveal the
role of time in an ongoing care relationship. Specifically, we provide
the notion caring through as a generative term to highlight the role
of time in care and the fluctuating care roles that are not fully

captured via existing terms. In the paper, we first discuss related
work in design-oriented HCI research, followed by a theoretical
background on care ethics, elaborate why a typology of care is
needed for design, and identify opportunities and implications for
’caring through.’
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Care as a lens in HCI and design research
In HCI, care has been used as an interaction framework for health
care, IoT, and community engagement [ 7]. Recent scholarship in-
creasingly considers care as a design lens beyond health care or care
of dependents such as the children and elderly [ 53]. Integrating care
into sociotechnical systems through technology is becoming an
important research avenue [ 10] while emphasizing care as a funda-
mental everyday activity. This has highlighted understudied aspects
of care through different terms and notions. For instance, Toombs
and colleagues use everyday care to address the ever-encompassing
nature of care [ 53], while Zhou and colleagues use mutualistic care
to point at the reciprocity in care and that the things we care for
also care for us in return [ 60]. Feminist ethics of care have been
influential in focusing on complex aspects of care in HCI, where re-
searchers unsettle care by paying attention to interdependence and
relationality instead of fixed power relations between caregiver and
receiver [ 24]. Similarly, Helms and Fernaeus [19] reveal tensions
around domestic care by foregrounding the unease, negative feel-
ings, and painful relations associated with care work. They develop
orientations for wickedness in design by emphasizing that these
tensions are not to be resolved but rather to be seen as sources of
contradictory desires that go beyond normative expectations [19].
2.1.1 Care in more-than-human design. As an emerging research
avenue, more-than-human design represents a paradigm shift in
HCI and human-centered design where the assumption of human
superiority is challenged, and the well-being of more-than-human
entities alongside humans is considered paramount. More-than-
human design thus prioritizes the ways of relating to more-than-
human entities in less human-centered ways, such as through acts
of noticing [ 32,46], attunement [ 31,33], and repertoires [ 41]. Care is
seen in more-than-human design as a practice with which we relate
to more-than-human worlds [ 56] to live together "as well as possi-
ble." Research in this realm includes the sustained growth of living
beings such as fungi, bacteria, plants, and more [ 17,21,42,51,60],
caring for non-biological entities such as AI [ 22], and feminist,
tactful, intimate care practices [ 1,11]. Recent work explores the
materiality of everyday care through living with silkworms [ 21]
and Cyanobacteria [ 59]. Sondergaard and Woytuk show how caring
for oneself through menstrual care practices can extend to caring
for other beings such as soil [ 51]. Lastly, at the intersection of care
ethics and posthumanism, Key and colleagues urge practitioners to
contribute to a feminist unsettling of HCI’s methodological commit-
ments based on a posthumanist design agenda, which deals with
relational understandings and temporalities of more-than-human
entities [ 24]. In design research, more-than-human care is multi-
layered, ongoing, and continuous, requiring a deep engagement
with time and more-than-human agency. Who cares for whom,
when, for how long, and who decides what are all relevant aspectsone needs to address in care involving more-than-human worlds
[40]. Specifically, more-than-human care, as inevitably bound up
in more-than-human rhythms and motions, makes temporalities
of more-than-human care a vital research avenue so far under-
studied [ 40]. Therefore, we see an opportunity to bridge the two
strands of research on temporality and care.
2.2 Time and temporality in HCI and design
research
Research in HCI and design has dealt with multiple aspects of tem-
porality. These range from deliberations over temporal forms in
interaction design [ 55], temporal characterization of living media
[3],slow design andslow technology [38], investigating longer-term
human-technology relations (i.e., interaction beyond use) [ 39], to
designing for slowness, solitude, and mental rest. Other works that
approach temporality from an empirical perspective include de-
signing for breakage and repair [ 20,47], with traces and patina
[48], as well as the afterlife as a state of things beyond immediate
interaction [ 58]. More recently, researchers have been critically
approaching time and temporality by looking at the underlying
definitions of time. The most well-known example is the conceptu-
alization of ‘temporal design’ by Pschetz and Bastian, in which time
is seen beyond dichotomies of speed (i.e., fast or slow) or duration
(i.e., long or short) towards social, cultural, and political dimensions
of time. According to tenets of temporal design, time is multiple,
heterogeneous, and arises from the unequal entanglements between
various social formations [44, p.174].
Designing with living beings naturally engages the researcher
with more-than-human temporality, as they involve processes of
growth, decay, degradation, and other more-than-human rhythms.
Current approaches to more-than-human temporality consist of
‘working at the pace of the nonhuman’ [ 5], which is framed as an
opportunity to slow down, particularly through the time it takes to
grow and cultivate nonhuman entities such as SCOBY (symbiotic
culture of bacteria and yeast). Additionally, differences in human
and nonhuman temporalities (temporal dissonances) can open up
valuable design spaces and opportunities for alignment [ 60]. These
differences in temporality invite discussions around more-than-
human temporality, presenting an alternative to our relationship
with time, shaped by global industrialization and the Anthropocene
[21]. As evident, designing with more-than-human temporalities is
gaining wide consideration as a way to attune to ecological worlds
[6, 12].
To bridge this research on care, time, and temporality, we unpack
the term temporalities of more-than-human care [40], which contain
multiple chronologies, past, present, and future, that may be enacted
and lived simultaneously in care relations. For example, a tree that a
human cares for lives long beyond the human, such as the living root
bridges of Meghalaya [ 25], taking shape through the collaborative
work of generations that span across centuries. Anticipating that the
tree will live on long after the human is experienced in the present
by the caregiver. In parallel, we owe the present conditions with
which the tree grows to the care work done in the past by our elders
and all the material (e.g., soil) and social assemblages that have come
before us. Additionally, there is duration anddelay in care; that the
effects of care may reveal themselves much later than when care
Caring through : Engaging with the temporality of care in more-than-human design HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA
is implemented. Delays, mismatches, and alignments are part of
any ongoing care practice. Experienced as latency (e.g., delay in
care), asynchrony (e.g., differences in human and more-than-human
rhythms), and synchrony (e.g., alignment of rhythms) through the
enactment of care, thus compose temporalities of care. Yet, the
engagement with more-than-human temporality can express time
beyond the fast-paced experience of everyday life, characterized
as experiences that are devoid of duration [18]. Care thus has a
temporal richness, which warrants generous thinking about time
and temporality (subjective experiences of time). We believe the
notion caring through encourages such generous thinking, along
with other typologies of care such as caring about, for, and with,
which shed light on different types of care based on engagement
with time and labor.
3 BACKGROUND
3.1 Typologies of care
Care can be broadly defined as "physical and emotional labor"
towards the other (e.g., humans, pets, plants, soil, water, and so
on) [ 8]. It is a practice with temporal and relational implications:
it takes time to care, and through care, we relate to the ones we
care for [ 14,27,37,54]. This rich view on care is indebted to the
work of multiple care ethicists. To give a few examples, Noddings
(2008) claims that care is, first and foremost, a relationship, and an
ethically caring relationship consists of reciprocity, dynamism, and
dependency. Kittay (2019) associates care with labor and attitude
towards the cared-for [ 26]. Despite abundant scholarly efforts to
define care, it remains elusive and hard to grasp [ 49] due to its
omnipresence in everyday life [ 59]. Care can mean performing
bodily labor for the well-being of others, being distant, or having
an emotional attachment toward the other. To develop a nuanced
understanding of care, we provide a typology based on different
types of care, i.e., care as labor, emotional attachment, or one’s
positioning. We scaffold this typology through categories such
as caring about ,for,with, and caring through . To illustrate each
category, we provide multiple definitions that we associate with
each term. These categories should not be taken as absolute or
fixed; we invite designers to also unsettle these categories, as they
unsettle care itself.
•Caring about — It involves anticipating needs, our position-
ing, and moral stance, such as ‘caring about the environment’
or ‘caring about sustainability’. Researchers may care about
their users, area of focus (i.e., sustainability), and methods.
Caring about does not necessarily lend itself to any labor
or time put into care; there can be a tendency to objectify
or alienate what is cared about when care is seen as a rela-
tion. Caring about others does not immediately substantiate
practices that involve making time for them.
•Caring for — It involves our intentionality towards the needs
of the cared-for and charting out a trajectory for care (i.e.,
planning how to meet different needs). Caring for often
indicates the subject-specific recipient of care work without
objectifying or alienating the subject of care. It involves the
practical work and physical labor of making time for the
other.•Caring with — It involves our attention to those with whose
agency we perform care with, in a reciprocal sense, i.e., in-
frastructure, materials, systems, and the labor of other beings
that enable care.
•Caring through — It involves temporally flexible practices
that are based on being responsive towards plural tempo-
ralities of care (i.e., delays, mismatches, and alignments), as
shown by the synchrony between the caregiver and care re-
ceiver, often dissolving the distinction more between giving
and receiving care more strongly than caring with, given
the temporal flexibility of how care also morphs the sense
of time.
Existing terms such as about andforimply different kinds of en-
gagement with time, including noticing, anticipating, and meeting
one’s needs. These bring forth different rhythms into the care rela-
tionship. However, they do not imply how care practices involve
the interdependence among (and blurring of) the roles between
the caregiver and care receiver due to diverse temporalities . Recent
studies respond to an imperative for more-than-human care and
question how relationality and temporality are becoming essential
to consider. One response belongs to Puig de la Bellacasa, stating
that care practices involve the carer with the rhythms of motion
and change that the cared-for goes through [ 45]. To illustrate, she
shows how caring for soil helps the caregiver to align themselves
with the pace with which soil metabolizes nutrients, renews itself,
and so on. This means any care practice directed towards soil needs
to follow the pace of the soil itself. Another response is to the reci-
procity and subjectivity requirements defined by Noddings and
Kittay, respectively. Brelje argues that reciprocity is not a human-
exclusive element; indeed, non-humans are very receptive to care
[9]. This reciprocity is established beyond human-centered means,
such as language and verbal communication. An organism’s growth
rate (i.e., fungi respond to different nutrients with different growth
rates), chemical indicators (the pH level of soil speaks to its level of
quality), and wagging tails (dogs express enthusiasm and affection
to care through wagging their tails) can all be elements of reci-
procity as much as a human’s confirmation of the care received.
This reciprocity confirms a more-than-human agency in care, a qual-
ity that we most frequently attributed to human-to-human care
relationships so far. More-than-human reciprocity moves beyond a
fixed relationship between an independent carer and a dependent
cared-for towards an interdependent and harmonious one, where
subjects in the care relationship are bound up in a pluralistic sense
of time.
Acknowledging the interdependent nature and more-than-
human temporalities of care, we must broaden the current ways
we think and design with care. These acknowledgments are needed
to inform better the technologies, systems, artifacts, and relation-
ships aimed toward more-than-human care. To expand the current
ways we design care, we introduce the notion caring through to
emphasize the role of time emerging in care practices.

attunement, and repertoires, all bring forth ethical and responsible
ways of building relations with more-than-humans. Noticing [ 32]
brings forth different ways of sensing the world around us, while
paying attention to dominant perspectives and subversive ways to
provide alternatives. Attunement [ 33] aims to expand our domi-
nant senses of vision, hearing, and touch and invites us to attune
to other senses that might play a more important role with more-
than-human entities, such as attuning to temperature, pH, or other
chemical and environmental indicators. Lastly, ‘repertoires’, as in-
troduced by Wakkary [ 56], and in work by Oogjes and Wakkary
Oogjes and Wakkary [41], serve as an inclusive term to encompass
everything we do to ensure the participation of nonhuman agency.
Building on these works, we see an opportunity to bring forth the
role of time in more-than-human care practices as an inseparable el-
ement of relating to more-than-humans. Thus, we contribute ‘caring
through’ to encompass diverse and plural engagements with time
in care practices, emerging through interdependent relationships
in care. Caring through means more-than-human care occurs via
rhythms beyond the human-centered rhythms of the clock or the
institutional rhythms (i.e., work, school) that we synchronize our
daily lives with. This allows us to synchronize our human-centered
rhythms with those of more-than-human paces and rhythms, or
work with asynchrony as a direct contributor to care practices.
Existing prepositions in English do not emphasize this possi-
bility, e.g., caring for implies a temporally one-way relationship
between an independent carer and a dependent cared for, which
limits the interdependence and the temporalities that arise from the
reciprocity, given that sometimes caregivers are also care receivers.
Similarly, caring about does not reflect the investment aspect ofmore-than-human care in terms of energy, labor, and time, in the
way that it takes time to care and care manifests itself primarily
through making time for the other .
Caring through encompasses previously defined kinds of care:
caring about, caring for, and caring with. Additionally, it recognizes
the diverse temporalities of care involved in the care relationship,
which is bound by the blurring of the roles between the caregiver
and care receiver. Below are some examples that illustrate caring
through in practical terms:
•Grazing animals such as goats, cows, and sheep eat ‘fire load’:
bush and plants that can be hazardous in creating a fire risk
[50]. Through this grazing behavior, they create cleared paths
in forests, lowering the risk of wildfires. Here, the land, the
forest, and the flora are cared through the agency of grazing
animals. This means paying attention to the landscape’s and
animals’ rhythm (i.e., the pace and timing of grazing).
•In 1995, Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, U.S.A. rein-
troduced wolves back into the park [ 43]. The reason was
that the deer’s overgrazing largely destroyed its streamside
vegetation, resulting from overpopulation without a preda-
tor. By bringing back the wolves, the deer population was
balanced. And by diminishing the deer population, the vege-
tation flourished in six years. Caring for vegetation happens
through the agency and labor of wolves via preying on the
deer.
•Practices that employ natural biological processes to elimi-
nate toxic contaminants, broadly defined as bioremediation
[35], is another example of caring through. In this ecologi-
cal technique, microorganisms, fungi, green plants, or their
Caring through : Engaging with the temporality of care in more-than-human design HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA
enzymes return the natural environment to its original con-
dition, altered by contaminants and effluents. Care happens
through the agency and labor of microorganisms and fungi
in the context of land restoration, conservation, and regen-
eration.
‘Caring through’ makes space for the multiple temporalities of
care, labor, and agency of the intertwined roles of the caregiver and
receiver. Compared to caring fororabout , caring through extends
the care work to initiate a ‘ripple of care’: cascading effects of care ,
where whom we care for may end up caring for others and ourselves
as a result of extending the temporal reach of care acts. Below, we
expand on one of the examples we previously provided to illustrate
further our conception.
Figure 1: Mycelium placed on soil. (a) The moment of place-
ment. (b) After two weeks. (c) After three weeks, with in-
creased vitality via the arrival of worms
4.0.1 Example: Caring through fungi. To illustrate caring through
further, we share an example of caring through fungi: The practice
of remediating soil and freshwater sources through the mycelium,
the root network of fungi. The first author(FA) has been involved
in practicing this method, called mycoremediation [ 34]. Within
mycoremediation, acts of care for fungi (i.e., growing fungi, main-
taining their growth with nutrients and proper conditions) create
ripples of care that extend beyond the keeping alive of fungi and
towards other more-than-human entities, such as the land, soil, and
freshwater.
In her practice, the FA cares for fungi by growing them in optimal
conditions, providing enough rich nutrients for maximum growth,
and keeping them in sterile conditions to prevent contamination,
i.e., the presence of harmful bacteria that can hinder the growth
of fungi. The through part of this care work begins outside the lab
environment, where the FA places composites of living mycelium in
places that may warrant care: areas of toxic waste, poor vegetation,
and so on. The act of placing living mycelium in a place that needs
care thus initiates a ripple of care: one act of care extends to become
an act of care for another.
Wherever placed, the living mycelium increases vitality in its
surroundings and invites other creatures (e.g., worms, termites,
and insects) to the area (see Figure 1). Additionally, through the
enzyme-releasing capacity of mycelium, harmful compounds in
the soil, such as petroleum, pesticide, or industrial dye, are broken
down into simpler molecules that the soil can metabolize. The
process involves working with multiple rhythms of fungi, soil, and
their interaction. The effects of placing the living mycelium at a
chosen site make its outcomes appear in a mediated fashion: it takes
time and blends the rhythms of soil and fungi to work together.
Reflecting on this practice, daily visits to the site can become asource of disappointment, as mycelium operates on a different
timescale and pace than the anticipated minutes, hours, and days
of human labor.
Bringing together the examples and characteristics defined so
far, below we present the main contribution of ‘caring through,’
which we hope to explore and discuss with the HTTF community:
4.0.2 We care through time. : Caring through accounts for syn-
chronous (temporal alignment between subjects), asynchronous
(temporal misalignment between subjects), and latent (delays in
care) aspects of care practices, which encompass plural temporali-
ties that take care beyond notions of immediacy and linearity. An
act of care may make its effect appear long after the moment of
implementation, which speaks to the previously mentioned aspect
of latency. In the Yellowstone example, bringing back the wolves
shows its result after six years. Similarly, we can design multi-
ple ways of caring for ecosystems that will outlive their human
caregivers. Thus, caring through responds to the need to think
generously about time and temporality, meaning that more-than-
human care is continuous and ongoing, moving past our notion of
time. Caring through time means staying with the consequences of
care long after it is implemented: it makes explicit how care prac-
tices encompass plural and layered engagement with time, with
unknown effects. Most importantly, humans are not the only care-
givers in more-than-human worlds. More-than-human entities care
for, with, and through us and others as much as humans’ capacity
to do the same. In the next section, we discuss the implications
caring through may have for HCI and design research.
5 DISCUSSION
We typologized kinds of care and the engagement they bring with
respect to time through categories of caring about, for, with, and
through. Specifically, we highlighted caring through as a notion
that pays attention to temporal divergences (e.g., synchrony, asyn-
chrony, and latency) and longitudinal temporal frames, as more-
than-human care takes time and is an ongoing practice. Caring
through extends the temporal reach of care practices by emphasiz-
ing the role time plays in care. In this section, we discuss opportu-
nities where caring through can mobilize generative thoughts and
practices in HCI and more-than-human design.
5.1 Accessing more-than-human temporalities
with care
The notion of ‘caring through’ can enrich and bridge the emerging
discourses on care and temporality in HCI and more-than-human
design. So far, these discourses have been handled separately, c.f.,
temporal design [ 44], seldom touching upon temporality and care
together [ 5,21,60]. Caring through offers a richer understanding of
the entanglements between care and time, to approach more-than-
human temporality through the unfolding and evolving of caring
relations. This perspective has two key implications: First, in con-
trast to how modern life is experienced and characterized as devoid
of duration [ 18], more-than-human care practices invite us into a
realm of time that emphasizes duration . This may manifest itself
through anticipation, delay, and reflection, allowing for possible
synchrony with other beings’ rhythms and asynchrony through
rhythmic differences. Second, engaging with more-than-human
HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA Oktay et al.
temporality through care involves respecting the pace and rhythm
of other beings in their own right rather than considering them
to being slow [ 4] or something to wait for. This acknowledgment
brings more-than-human agency to share the stage with humans
[56], while enable us humans to quietly leave the stage in favor of
more-than-human agency to shine without our interference.
Wakkary interprets more-than-human care as not just acts of
care but also creating possibilities for care . Informed by Puig de
la Bellacasa’s work on speculative ethics of care [ 14], possibilities
for care expand through speculating on how relations with more-
than-human entities could be , rather than how they already are
[56]. The emphasis on possibility and alternatives is imbued with
expressions of time beyond dominant narratives of progression and
an accelerated sense of futures. With caring through, the temporal
aspect of such speculative alternatives is capitalized. Thus, more-
than-human care is not just about creating forms of care [ 1,11,
17,21,42,51,60], but actively imagining evolving relationships
with more-than-human entities through care. To mobilize such
possible relationships based on imagining alternatives [ 30], we ask
researchers to deliberate on how time and temporality can be made
explicit and become generative elements in more-than-human care
practices.
5.2 Ripples of care
The possibility of caring for one being through another over time
makes explicit how we depend on the entities to whom we provide
care. Caring through means tending to the care practice beyond
instantaneous enactments of care toward its relational trajectory,
to the displacement of established roles between the caregiver and
care receiver. Current design research on more-than-human care
often involves practices focusing on a single organism such as lactic
acid bacteria, slime mold, and silkworm [ 13,21,42]. Yet, care is more
than seeking to keep an organism alive. While this is definitely an
example of care, it does not address how caring for one organism
can extend to caring for each other and yet-to-be-imagined beings.
The notion of caring through invites researchers to think of acts of
care towards one being (i.e., growing fungi, keeping bacteria alive)
as not an outcome to achieve but the beginning of ripples of care :
the cascading effects of care that allow caring for diverse beings
through another in a temporally pluralistic manner. In their work,
Sondergaard and Woytuk discuss possibilities for how menstrual
care for the self can extend into caring for the soil through blood
becoming a nutrient source for soil [ 51]. We see this as an example
of how caring through can be mobilized to think in extended and
relational ways about care. Similarly, caring through extends the
act of care to possibly account for caring for another being in more-
than-human design.
5.3 Intermediate engagement
Our last implication for caring through is Artificial Intelligence
(AI) as a more-than-human entity [ 36]. Research in this realm in-
cludes community-oriented care through online moderation [ 57],
enhancing individual’s self-compassion via caring for a chatbot
[29], unpacking social, ethical, and political implications of AI via
exploring ’how to care for’ creative-AI tools [ 22]. AI as a recipient
of MtH care has been approached from the caring foraspect, which,as discussed before, limits what care can initiate beyond the act of
care. On the other hand, caring through AI extends caring for and
caring about by making the intermediate role of AI more explicit
in design. This opens up opportunities to think of AI as interde-
pendent with potential partners in care practices (i.e., living beings,
ecosystems, communities).
5.4 Positionality statement
In the spirit of reflexivity, we find it important to share our posi-
tionality. All authors have diverse social, cultural, and academic
backgrounds, spanning Middle Eastern, Western European, East
Asian and North American contexts. The first, second, and third
authors are non-native English speakers, while the last author is
a native English speaker. For all authors, English is the primary
language used in their personal and professional lives, shaping their
shared understanding of care.
The notion of care through should be understood in the context
of the English etymology of “care,” which embodies the dichotomy
between object (the cared-for or care receiver) and subject (the
carer or caregiver). The relevance and implication of the presented
framework for other languages and cultures, where this distinction
is more fluid, warrant further attention beyond the scope of this
paper.
We acknowledge that this linguistic framework may narrow
one’s perspective on care, as language shapes how we catego-
rize care through prepositions such as "about," "for," "with," and
"through." We feel these prepositions are essential for clarifying
interactions, particularly between caregivers and receivers, and for
indicating temporal and spatial dimensions in language, though
may encourage a partial perspective on care. However, we want to
emphasize that our categorization of care types is not intended to
create divisions but to enrich our understanding of care, towards
a more comprehensive and nuanced one, through diverse engage-
ments with time and place. Specifically, we use "through" to signify
the process-based and rippling aspects of care, inviting a temporally
pluralistic and open-ended understanding of time.
6 CONCLUSION
There is an imperative to acknowledge more-than-human agency
and temporality in care practices. We care for, with, and through
more-than-human entities as much as they do the same for us. This
brings forth the need to develop generative notions that emphasize
the role of time and the reciprocal elements of care. We contributed
‘caring through’ to encompass the complexity of more-than-human
agency and temporality as connected elements of more-than-human
care. We offered typologies of care with particular attention given
tocaring through as a generative term that connects temporal-
ity and care, two inseparable aspects that weave the rich fabric
of our relationships with more-than-human entities. We always
care through; it is the through part that a thick involvement with
more-than-human entities exists for relationships that make living
together possible in temporally generous ways.
