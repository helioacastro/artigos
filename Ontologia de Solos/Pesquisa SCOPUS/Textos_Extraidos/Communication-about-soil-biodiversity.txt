Science essaysABSTRACT
Given the urgency of the global soil degradation crisis, soil scientists must communicate the importance of soil as 
being part of nature and the critical need for conserving soil biodiversity. Drawing on a thematic analysis of 
editorials related to soil conservation and management, we analyzed common themes, key messages, and frames 
that authors used to advocate for change. Soil biodiversity was referred to in 8 of the 11 editorials, but it was less 
emphasized and discussed in less detail than messages centered around food production, water resources, and 
climate change. Editorials structured arguments around economic development, scientific and technical uncer -
tainty, and morality and ethics. We believe future editorials should apply other persuasive frames including 
social progress, public accountability, and working-towards-compromise when advocating for soil biodiversity 
conservation. Soil ecologists can improve communications about soil biodiversity by (1) identifying an audience 
and selecting relevant key messages, (2) strategically applying a persuasive frame, and (3) amplifying diverse 
voices with a consistent message. We provide a guide for developing essays that encourages soil ecologists to 
shape discourse, advance policy priorities, and enable non-soil ecologists to communicate about soil biodiversity 
conservation.
Soils harbor significant biodiversity with innumerable organisms 
that interact in complex communities from which critical ecosystem 
processes emerge (Orgiazzi et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2015 ). Despite 
this, soils are degrading at an alarming rate globally with persistent 
threats to soil biodiversity (Orgiazzi et al., 2016; Amundson et al., 
2015 ). Soil scientists face challenges like those in climate change 
discourse when communicating about global soil degradation: the 
public lacks a nuanced understanding of the problem; it is difficult to 
translate awareness to action and behavioral change; and the broad 
scope of the problems (and solutions) may lead to feelings of being 
overwhelmed and hopeless (Moser, 2016 ). Addressing these challenges 
requires diverse science communication strategies that identify soils as a 
"keystone ” to solving global environmental challenges (Bouma and 
McBratney, 2013 ), and articulate the “essence ” of soil biodiversity 
(Byrne, 2022 ). To increase public appreciation of soil biodiversity and 
garner support for conservation research and policies, soil biologists and 
ecologists (hereafter soil ecologists for simplicity) should employ diverse 
rhetorical strategies informed by science communication research. 
When soil ecologists align communication strategies within the discipline, the argument for soil biodiversity conservation becomes 
more compelling to non-soil scientists who can then advocate for the 
same goals.
Science editorials are one form of science communication that can 
inform rhetorical strategies by both critiquing how science is dissemi -
nated and offering recommendations (Hulme et al., 2018 ). Editorials are 
texts grounded in persuasive frames and reveal the rhetorical devices 
used by scientists to communicate ideas and advocate for change. These 
are defined as “openly subjective and highly opinionated, taking strong 
stands on issues of interest ” (Sommer and Maycroft, 2008 , p. 588). 
Hence, editorial essays are an opportunity for soil ecologists to appeal to 
their colleagues about the need to study, preserve, and advocate for soil 
biodiversity. Scientists in related disciplines (e.g., Earth science, plant 
science, ecology, geology, conservation biology) can draw from the key 
messages and frames presented in editorials when communicating about 
soils, their biodiversity, and associated topics. Similarly, these commu -
nication strategies may then be picked up by non-scientists (e.g. jour-
nalists, land managers, conservation advocates) who increasingly 
communicate about soil life. In short, consistency in messaging enables

amplification and persuasion (Williams and Eosco, 2021; Soares et al., 
2023 ).
While some soil ecologists have appealed broadly to other scientists 
in academic journals through editorials, we argue that even more can be 
done by learning from the communication strategies used by climate 
scientists, whose prolific and diverse ways of communicating to different 
audiences have ensured that both academics and non-academics engage 
in discussions about the importance of climate change (Leiserowitz 
et al., 2021 ). For example, over a 50-year period, there were 500 edi-
torials in just two academic journals (Science and Nature ) that focused on 
climate change and the engagement of scientists with the public (Hulme 
et al., 2018 ). Likewise, soil ecologists can engage the broader scientific 
community in discussions about the importance of including soil 
biodiversity in public dialogue about conservation. Furthermore, it be-
hooves soil ecologists to use rhetorical devices, such as framing, to ap-
peal to a broader audience. Here, we examine how soil scientists have 
incorporated soil biodiversity into their own editorial essays in academic 
journals.
Using thematic analytical methods (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ) to 
identify rhetorical strategies, we examined: 1) how many soil-related 
editorials were published over 21 years in 17 academic journals; 2) 
common themes and key messages in the editorials and 3) rhetorical 
devices (i.e., framing) authors used to advocate for change (see Sup-
plementary Materials for methods). We conducted our search in both 
disciplinary-specific journals (e.g., Soil Biology and Biochemistry ) and 
journals with a broader science audience (e.g., Nature ). We selected 
editorials that discussed soil management, conservation, and/or resto-
ration through a general lens, rather than describing a specific technique 
or finding. Several insights emerged. First, unlike climate change, a topic 
about which science editorials are plentiful (e.g., Hulme et al., 2018 ), we 
retrieved only 11 editorials over 21 years in the academic journals 
surveyed (Supplementary Materials ). Second, while biodiversity and soil 
life were described in several editorials (8 of 11), this theme was less 
common compared to arguments focusing on food production (11 of 11) 
and security (11 of 11), water resources (9 of 11), and climate change (9 
of 11) (Supplementary Materials ). In other words, soil ecology was more 
often presented in the context of anthropocentric concerns and 
ecosystem services rather than through the lens of biodiversity conser -
vation. Third, editorial authors most commonly framed their arguments 
around economic development, scientific and technical uncertainty, and 
morality and ethics (Nisbet, 2014 ), but other rhetorical devices may be 
useful for communicating about soil biodiversity. Below, we unpack the 
common themes, key messages, and rhetorical devices that recurred in 
the editorials and provide recommendations for future communication 
about soil biodiversity.
1.Common themes and key messages
Prioritizing the expertise of soil scholars and practitioners can lead to 
greater integration of soil knowledge in decision making (Gonzalez Lago 
et al., 2019 ). To do so, soil scientists should identify critical ideas to 
align messaging and provide guidance for those outside the discipline to 
amplify these messages. For example, the key messages put forth by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) during 
the 2015 International Year of Soils (Supplementary Materials ) and for 
annual World Soil Day campaigns provide broad guidance for those 
developing arguments about the importance of soil. These messages 
include production and security of food, fuel, and fiber, water resources, 
climate change, and biodiversity. The messaging around links between 
soil and biodiversity highlights that soils both support biodiversity 
aboveground and serve as habitat for biodiversity belowground. Our 
analysis of editorials revealed that FAO key messages are well aligned 
with the ideas and priorities of soil scientists (Supplementary Materials ). 
Broad key messages can be particularly useful for non-scientists 
communicating about soils and related environmental issues, so soil 
scientists should continue aligning their messages with those of the FAO. However, general soil knowledge may be communicated without direct 
consideration of soil biodiversity. Soil ecologists have expertise and 
ideas that go far beyond general messages about soil conservation. Even 
when soil ecologists acknowledge the important role that biota play in 
soil functions, it is important to communicate these ideas within the 
broader scientific discipline and public. Key messages about soil life are 
needed to raise awareness about its importance among scientists, in 
formal educational settings, and in public discouse.
We posit that general messages about soil conservation should be 
coupled with more specific messages when communicating about a 
component of soils such as soil life. Specific key messages can help soil 
ecologists and disciplinary allies communicate about and advocate for 
soil biodiversity more effectively. The Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas 
identifies seven key messages specific to the conservation of soil life 
including the importance of the soil as habitat, identifying patterns of 
soil biodiversity around the globe, connecting soil biodiversity with 
specific ecosystem services, threats to soil biodiversity, and prioritizing 
policy solutions (Orgiazzi et al., 2016 ). The editorials we reviewed echo 
these messages. For example, Manter et al., 2017 identify soil as habitat 
and call for a global repository to help identify spatial patterns of soil 
biodiversity and functions. Editorials also linked soil biodiversity to 
ecosystem services such as supporting human health (Wall and Six, 
2015 ) and ecological processes such as bioweathering (Banwart, 2011 ). 
Some editorials identified threats to soil biodiversity from human ac-
tivities such as land use change (Anonymous, 2010 ) and proposed policy 
solutions (Wall and Six, 2015 ). Even so, soil biodiversity was not a major 
thematic emphasis in the editorials we reviewed.
The concept of soil health provides an example of the implications of 
a lag in communications about soil life among scientists. Soil health is 
generally useful as a metaphor to guide discussion about soil functions, 
despite challenges of definition, measurement, and interpretation 
(Lehmann et al., 2020; Janzen et al., 2021 ). Even though we understand 
that biological interactions support soil health, efforts to quantify soil 
health still primarily rely on chemical indicators (Lehmann et al., 2020 ). 
Only one of the editorials( Manter et al., 2017 ) made the link between 
soil biota and soil health explicit, while the three other editorials that 
mention soil health provided either general descriptions or defined the 
concept based on soil functions (Grandy et al., 2010; Anonymous 2015b; 
Anonymous, 2017 ). As a result, policy initiatives underpinned by the 
soil health concept may lack meaningful integration with soil biota.
Soil ecologists can use key messages about soil biodiversity to guide 
public discourse and subsequently policy priorities. However, scientific 
messages with many dimensions of complexity, such as those about soil 
biodiversity conservation, may not be readily translated into public 
discourse, practice, and policy (Meinard and Qu˘etier, 2014 ). In fact, a 
review of conservation policies in Europe found limited benefits of those 
policies for soil biodiversity (Zeiss et al., 2022 ). In addition to aligning 
key messages, another way to address the challenges of communicating 
complexity is to use similar, consistent persuasive perspectives 
(“frames ”) so that scholars whose interests intersect with soil ecologists ’ 
can evaluate which ideas to prioritize.
2.Frames used in essays about soil biodiversity
Soil ecologists can use framing to highlight values and morals, create 
a shared sense of reality, and persuade diverse audiences about impor -
tant issues (Druckman, 2001; Goffman, 1974 ). By applying a frame 
when presenting an argument, a communicator can persuade their 
audience about the importance of an issue (Hulme et al., 2018 ). When 
writing about science, people communicate messages through the lens of 
their own perspectives, beliefs, and expertise (Balgopal et al., 2017; 
Kelly and Takao, 2003 ). They draw on data to support their positions 
based on both what is meaningful to them and what they perceive their 
audience will understand (Nielsen, 2011 ). The process of framing leads 
scientists to interpret scientific issues for readers in non-neutral ways, 
even if they intend to remain objective (Weber and Schell Word, 2001 ). Y. Pressler et al.

Acknowledging this dimension of communication and strategically 
selecting an appropriate frame will help soil ecologists better simplify 
and convey their messages to diverse audiences. In other words, message 
consistency helps audiences remember take-home points (Williams and 
Eosco, 2021 ).
Nisbet’s (2014) typology of frames used in science writing illustrates 
the most common ways that science essays are presented including: (1) 
social progress; (ii) economic development; (iii) morality and ethics; (iv) 
scientific and technical uncertainty; (v) awareness of ‘runaway’ science; 
(vi) public accountability; (vi) working-towards-compromise; and (viii) 
conflict and strategy among competing science writers. This typology 
can be applied beyond written arguments and serves as a heuristic to 
strengthen and align communication around soil biodiversity. Our sur-
vey of editorials revealed that soil scientists already apply frames that 
align with Nisbet’s (2014) framework, whether intentionally or not. The 
economic development, scientific and technical uncertainty, and mo-
rality and ethics frames were most commonly applied in the editorials 
we reviewed.
Centering the economic value of soils and their functions may be key 
to attracting the attention and action of policy makers (Dazzi and Lo 
Papa, 2022 ). In our sample of soil-related editorials, the economic 
development frame was prevalent. Authors called for action through 
political (4 of 11 editorials) and financial (5 of 11) investments in soil 
management and conservation (Supplementary Materials ). For example, 
in the essay A Business Case for Soil, Davies (2017) applies the economic 
development frame by arguing for investment in soil remediation from 
business leaders to mitigate risks of environmental crises to supply 
chains. Investing in and incentivizing advanced technology to improve 
soil management is also proposed as a solution to soil degradation by 
Grandy et al. (2010) . Soil biodiversity provides both output values 
(ecosystem services) and insurance values (mitigating and adapting to 
risks) as natural capital (Pascual et al., 2015 ). Greater accessibility to 
soil information that describes the economic value of soil biodiversity 
and its contributions to sustainability goals can lead to stronger policies 
that aid soil stewardship (Bach et al., 2020 ). The policies themselves also 
serve to communicate soil issues to the public (Bouma et al., 2012 ). 
Increasing the translation of soil biodiversity science into economic and 
policy decisions requires that soil science and ecology experts first 
engage in dialogue within the scientific community so that messages can 
be clearly translated to actions. For example, Wall & Six (2015) high-
lighted examples of successful engagement with policy makers to direct 
initiatives aimed at conserving soils and biodiversity. Successful narra -
tives around soil issues must consider not only robust scientific findings, 
but also integrate socio-political dimensions (Bouma, 2015; Gonzalez 
Lago et al., 2019 ), as done by several editorial authors: Wall and Six 
(2015) , Banwart (2011) , and Montanarella (2015) .
Much scientific and technical uncertainty surrounding soil biodi -
versity still exists as soil biodiversity is understudied compared to other 
domains of biodiversity (Guerra et al., 2022; Orgiazzi et al., 2016 ). Ar-
guments to conserve soil biodiversity benefit from framing around un-
certainty (Guerra et al., 2022 ), particularly when evaluating risks of 
biodiversity loss due to anthropogenic influences (Pascual et al., 2015 ) 
and designing conservation strategies (Parker, 2010 ). Editorial authors 
commonly drew on this frame. For example, the essay Investing in Soils 
(Anonymous, 2010 ) ends by identifying an urgent need to know more 
about how soils respond to climate and land use changes. Yaalon (2000)
argues for greater investment in research of pedodiversity and biodi -
versity to fill knowledge gaps that are relevant for understanding 
human-environment interactions. Similarly, another editorial 
(Anonymous, 2015 ) argues that understanding the soil environment is 
the first step to soil conservation. However, this one did not explicitly 
identify soil biodiversity as a component of the soil environment, 
underscoring the need to better integrate soil life into dialogue about 
soil conservation (Guerra et al., 2021 ). In terms of technological un-
certainty, Manter et al., (2017) argue that soil preservation is necessary 
because technology to characterize soil biological communities continues to advance rapidly.
When advocating for preserving soil biodiversity and engaging in soil 
stewardship, arguments that frame soils in the context of morality and 
ethics (Nisbet, 2014 ) are needed. There was some mention of soil 
stewardship in two of the editorials (Anonymous, 2015b, Grandy et al., 
2010 ). However, none of them explicitly mention a moral obligation to 
conserve soils or soil biodiversity. Caring for soils requires a relational 
view of soils and their inhabitants as entities that are intrinsically valued 
(Puig De La Bellacasa, 2015; Krzywoszynska, 2019 ). Yaalon (2000)
described the inherent value of soils as a part of nature and Grandy et al. 
(2010) mention needing to “care for” soils, but none of the editorials 
explicitly framed their argument around the concept of soil care (sensu 
Puig De La Bellacasa, 2015 ). We suggest that soil ecologists consider 
persuasive frames that make a moral argument for preserving soil 
biodiversity for its own sake, rather than conceptualizing soil as a nat-
ural resource from which humanity can extract economic value. One 
way to advance this message is by focusing on cultivating curiosity in a 
variety of audiences for the complex, often unseen ecological in-
teractions between soil organisms (Byrne, 2022 ).
3.Recommendations for communicating about soil biodiversity
We encourage soil ecologists and communicators to (1) clearly 
identify their audience and select key messages accordingly, (2) strate -
gically communicate arguments using a persuasive frame, such as one of 
Nisbet’s (Box 1), and (3) amplify diverse perspectives while communi -
cating consistently about the importance of soil biodiversity.
3.1. Identify audience and select relevant key messages
Communication efforts aimed at specific audiences and contexts may 
necessitate different or multiple key messages. Identifying relevant 
themes can reveal the motivations behind arguments to make them 
stronger. While individual communicators may focus on a single mes-
sage or audience, soil ecologists as a collective group of communicators 
should consider the multiple key messages and persuasive strategies 
discussed above that are best suited for the audience and context 
(Gonzalez Lago et al., 2019 ). Both the quality and quantity of arguments 
included in a communication effort influence its effectiveness. In doing 
so, claims can be more persuasive (Petty and Cacioppo, 1984; Ranga -
nath et al., 2010 ).
Soil ecologists can shape discourse about soil biodiversity by care-
fully considering the audiences with whom they already communicate. 
Both students and the public can help spread awareness of soil biodi -
versity and translate ideas to actions, but they rely on clear, aligned 
messaging from experts. Soil ecologists who teach courses on relevant 
topics can influence how students in their classes communicate about 
soils beyond the classroom by modeling an approach that emphasizes 
curiosity and action (e.g., soil care and stewardship). Formal soil science 
education may benefit from moving away from a sub-disciplinary or-
ganization toward a more integrated approach based on soil functions, 
services, and health (Brevik et al., 2022 ). Discussions of soil biodiversity 
fit well within these integrated approaches because soil organisms 
mediate many soil functions and are an inherent component of soil 
health (Lehmann et al., 2020 ). Yet, a survey of focal topics in under -
graduate soil science courses in the US revealed that biological prop-
erties were not included in the top 10 most deeply taught topics (Jelinski 
et al., 2019 ). This “soil education gap” wherein soil biodiversity is 
underemphasized in soil science courses must be addressed (Byrne, 
2016; Eisenhauer et al., 2022 ), but knowledge of soil does not neces -
sarily translate to soil stewardship (Neaman et al., 2024 ). Soil ecologists 
engaged in education should identify key messages related to soil 
biodiversity that are contextualized and relevant to the student popu -
lation so that greater soil literacy will transcend the “soil stewardship 
paradox” (Neaman et al., 2024 ) and inform the way students regard, 
speak about, and interact with soils and soil life.Y. Pressler et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Pedobiologia  - Journal  of Soil Ecology  107 (2024)  151003  
3 
It is critical to ground communication efforts in local contexts and 
communities because our perception of biodiversity depends on context 
(Cicchino et al., 2023; Bernardo et al., 2021 ). When people experience 
public communications that value biodiversity in their community, they 
are more likely to perceive biodiversity as important (Bernardo et al., 
2021 ). Communications that ground global issues in local soil features, 
processes, and challenges can connect directly with a local audience and 
lead to greater soil stewardship (Fairhead and Scoones, 2005 ). For 
example, in an urban setting, discussions about soil degradation could 
focus on novel anthropogenic soil types, patterns of urban soil biodi -
versity, challenges with trace metal contamination, and opportunities 
for soil restoration (Byrne and Szlavecz, 2023; Paltseva et al., 2022; Kim 
et al., 2014 ). Localizing communications is especially needed for soil 
biodiversity where species are geographically restricted (Byrne, 2022 ) 
and therefore valued differently depending on location, time, and 
stakeholder perspectives. To engage public audiences in discourse about 
local soils, soil ecologists can increase awareness and appreciation 
through soil art and aesthetics (Moscatelli and Marinari, 2024; MacE -
wan et al., 2017; Feller et al., 2015 ), by framing messages around terroir, 
soil health, and soil security (Brevik et al., 2019 ), and by expanding accessibility to local soil knowledge through atlases and databases 
(Bouma et al., 2012; Orgiazzi et al., 2016 ). In all cases, careful consid -
eration of the themes and messages that resonate with an audience will 
increase the impact of communication efforts.
3.2. Strategically apply a persuasive frame
Depending on the audience and intended message, soil ecologists can 
use several persuasive frames to craft narratives about soil biodiversity 
(Box 1). In addition to the frames commonly used in the editorials 
presented aboved, soil ecologists can also apply the social progress, 
working-towards-compromise, and public accountability frames 
(Nisbet, 2014 ). The social progress frame (Nisbet, 2014 ) argues that 
greater understanding about soil biodiversity will improve people ’s 
lives. This frame is appropriate because soil scientists have identified 
links between soil biodiversity, soil functions, and human health (Wall 
et al., 2015; Brevik et al., 2020 ). Communities also need access to in-
formation about the connections between soils and human health to 
make decisions at individual and organizational scales (Brevik et al., 
2020 ).Box 1

Soil degradation is a “wicked problem” that requires coordination 
across many areas of expertise and lived experience. Most of the edito -
rials in our analysis (10 of 11) included more than one call-to-action, 
suggesting agreement among authors that addressing soil degradation 
requires multiple interacting solutions. To this end, soil scientists must 
engage across networks of land users, regulators, and scientists to 
expand attention to and care for soils and their inhabitants 
(Krzywoszynska, 2019 ). Six of the editorials called for greater collabo -
ration among scientists, land managers, and policy makers 
(Supplementary Materials ), but collaboration does not necessarily imply 
compromise. Framing the problem as complex and multifaceted is a 
critical first step to environmental governance where consensus building 
can be challenging when those involved have diverse and sometimes 
divergent interests (van den Ende et al., 2023 ). The 
working-towards-compromise frame (Nisbet, 2014 ) can be used to 
acknowledge that diverse communities of practice will have different 
ideas about soil biodiversity conservation. Similarly, the public 
accountability frame (Nisbet, 2014 ) can be applied to advocate for 
collective action by exploring who is responsible for following through 
on conservation goals related to soils. Such dialogue can lead to 
“responsibilization” (sensu van den Ende et al., 2023 ) of the soil degra -
dation crisis.
3.3. Amplify diverse voices with a consistent message
Our review found that soil biodiversity was not a major emphasis in 
editorials arguing for soil conservation. Consistent messaging about the 
role of soil biodiversity in ecosystems and the need for conservation is 
critical (Williams et al., 2021 ). But consistent key messages alone are not 
enough. Soil ecologists must also communicate those messages persua -
sively. We found that several persuasive frames are underutilized in 
editorials. Communicators select different persuasive frames based on 
their lived experience and cultural context (Balgopal et al., 2017 ). To 
make soil conservation an issue about which everyone cares, soil sci-
entists should support and amplify diverse perspectives (Carter et al., 
2021 ). Soil science communications must better represent communities, 
practitioners, and land users that have historically been left out of these 
conversations. Critical perspectives have been missing in communica -
tion efforts, even though global soil and environmental crises dis-
proportionally impact marginalized and vulnerable communities 
(Berhe, 2020 ). Therefore, soil ecologists must both provide consistent 
messages about soil biodiversity conservation and support diverse voi-
ces in framing those messages in ways that resonate with different au-
diences. Only then, can soil conservation be everyone’s issue and not 
that just of soil scientists.
Further, the pool of communicators who talk and write about soil 
biodiversity should be expanded. Soil science is one of the least diverse 
subdisciplines in environmental science when evaluated across several 
axes of identity including ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and 
disability, among others (e.g., Carter et al., 2021 ; Vaughan et al., 2019 ). 
Members of marginalized communities have also been overlooked or 
excluded from science communication and a focus on inclusion and 
equity in the discipline is needed (Dawson, 2014; Canfield et al., 2020 ). 
Individual actions scientists can take to address gaps include acknowl -
edging the exclusion of diverse voices in soil science communication, 
amplifying the work of diverse scholars and communicators, and 
learning the local history of the soils about which one communicates. 
Institutions can contribute to this goal by financially supporting soil 
science communication efforts and recognizing it as part of evaluation 
and promotion pathways.
4.Conclusion
Soil ecologists have both a responsibility and opportunity to shape 
discourse and policy priorities around soil biodiversity conservation. In 
our review of soil-related editorials, we found that while biodiversity was often mentioned, it was not the most common key message 
compared to those focused on food and fiber production, climate 
change, and water resources. We also found that authors framed essays 
around economic development, scientific and technological uncertainty, 
and morality and ethics, but opportunities to apply other persuasive 
strategies still remain. Informed by this review, we provided recom -
mendations for soil ecologists communicating about soil biodiversity 
including considering the audience and clarifying key messages, draw -
ing from science communication research to select a persuasive frame, 
and amplifying diverse voices and perspectives with consistent 
messaging. When soil ecologists apply these recommendations to refine 
communication strategies within the discipline, non-soil ecologists will 
become more equipped to communicate about soil biodiversity. Helping 
the public and non-soil scientists see soil biodiversity conservation as 
“their” issue will ensure that people want to increase their knowledge 
and actions around it (Loyau and Schmeller, 2017 ). We call on soil 
ecologists to help others speak for soil life.
