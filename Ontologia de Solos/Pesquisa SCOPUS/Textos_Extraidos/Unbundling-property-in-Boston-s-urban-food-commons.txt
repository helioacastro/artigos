ABSTRACT
Households and community organizations are involved in the
creation, use, care, and management of urban spaces, including
through food practices such as planting, foraging, harvesting,
weeding and pruning at the ambiguous edges of public and
private property. Drawing on case studies in Boston,
Massachusetts, we examine how commons are articulated through
these practices, particularly in relation to multiple dimensions of
property rights. Speci ﬁcally, we ask how food practices can open
urban spaces to negotiations around access, responsibility, care,
and ownership, especially when (property) ownership is not an
end-goal, but a circumstance shaping other practices. Using inter-
views and participant observation of individuals and organizations
involved in urban food provisioning, we explore how households
and community organizations are interrupting ﬁxed notions of
property ownership, by practicing urban commons. These prac-
tices and negotiations demonstrate ongoing shifts in the mean-
ings of urban space with ﬂexible understandings of property and
ownership.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
City scenes :
After bicycling his kids to school, Rick stops by a community garden in Cambridge,
where he is not a member, in order to harvest some of the blueberries that grow at its
edge. Noticing a patch of black and blue stains on the sidewalk, he stops in front of
someone else ’s house and picks a handful of mulberries from a branch that over-
hangs the sidewalk. The mulberry tree is planted on private property, but its ripe
berries drop steadily onto public property.
On his way home from work, Russ cuts down bunches of the highly invasive plant
Japanese Knotweed, from a park to bake into a pie that he will share with his wife.
Jenny exits the subway on her way home from work and checks on the veggies she
has planted in a public planter in Jamaica Plain.

Walking home, Sam enters a neighbor ’s yard to check on an apple tree that he and
the League of Urban Canners ( 2014 ) have received permission to harvest.
In the middle of the night Jay leaves his home with a shovel and three small apricot
trees, he meets a friend on a quiet street near Kendall Square, and together they dig
holes to plant their trees on public property (interviews and ﬁeld notes).
While researching urban homesteading, a sustainable lifestyle movement (Coyne &
Knutzen, 2010 ; Kaplan & Blume, 2011 ), in greater Boston, Massachusetts, the ﬁrst
author heard about, witnessed, and participated in many food provisioning practices
such as the ones illustrated above. What strikes us about these practices is their
assertion of use rights to urban nature and their potential for creating shared resources
that over ﬂow the boundaries of private property and ownership. In this paper, we ask
how such food provisioning practices can open up urban spaces to new negotiations
around access, responsibility, care, and ownership between diverse stakeholders. In
answering this question we seek to attend to the role of power and di ﬀerence, particu-
larly around race, exclusion, and privilege, in shaping these practices, placing notions of
commons and commoning at the center of broader struggles over community, prop-
erty, and belonging in the city.
We begin from the premise that unbundlin g property into its constituent parts
can reveal the social practices that make and remake urban space and resources as
property (Gibson-Graham, Cameron, & Healy, 2013 ;P i e r c e , 2010 ). Examining the
negotiations that arise around property use, access, responsibility, care, and owner-
ship complicates the seemingly straigh tforward status of urban space as merely
public or private, revealing multiple s ites and opportunities for commoning
(Blomley, 2016 ;L a n g , 2014 ). This paper argues that care and responsibility are
fundamental to the practice, creation, and maintenance of commons. We elaborate
this argument in three parts. First, we out line key assumptions about the mutually
reinforcing relationships between care, labor, and ownership that are embedded in
property theory, before reviewing more recent scholarship on the urban
commons. Second, we introduce our case studies of urban food initiatives in
Boston. Third, we draw on ethnographic research to explore property and food
practices in greater Boston, examining how a ccess, care, responsibility, ownership,
and the bene ﬁt so fc o m m o n sa r en e g o t i a t e db yt h ep e o p l ew h ou s et h e m .
Understanding commons as relational property practices
“Property can be understood as a relationship of belonging that is held up by the
surrounding space –a relationship that is not ﬁxed but temporally and spatially contin-
gent ”(Keenan, 2010 , p. 423).
“Real property in Western liberal societies is conventionally held in territorial units of space,
aﬀecting the manner in which rights are allocated and contained. Laypersons seem to treat
property and the space as synonymous, investing considerable energy in the maintenance of
the boundary, driven by a desire to stay 'between the lines' (Perin 1988 ). Thus, I can grow
tomatoes on 'my' land, but not my neighbor ’s, unless invited" (Blomley, 2016 ,p .2 2 5 )1486 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
Rights, practices, and responsibilities
We examine property as part of our analysis of food provisioning in Boston because
property expresses a legal relationship to land and its uses. As legal and commons
scholars have noted, property is much more than a spatial container, physical object,
or private right. It is a set of social practices and performances that are open to
negotiation and require constant upkeep and maintenance for their reproduction
(Blomley, 2016 ; Keenan, 2010 ; Velicu & García-López, 2018 ). Property is most
recognizable as a “bundle of rights, ”including use, access, usufruct, improvement,
sale, the right to exclude others, and the right not to be excluded; but it is also
something made and remade through everyday practices (Blomley, 2008 ;P i e r c e ,
2010 ). Such practices include the negotiation of the rights described above, as well
as practices of appropriation, occupation, inhabitance, care, responsibility, and
stewardship.
In the context of urban food provisioning, property practices and rights can some-
times be in direct opposition to one another, as is especially evident in land use con ﬂicts
over community gardens (Staeheli, Mitchell, & Gibson, 2002 ). When community
gardeners engage in property practices, like care, by mixing their labor with the land,
enhancing its utility and eating its fruits, they are also making a property claim, around
community access, control, and use. However, unless they have long-term leases or own
their land,1the use-based claim of urban gardeners does not usually guarantee them the
same rights as the property owner (e.g. the city or a developer) who may decide to evict
the gardeners and sell the land (Schmelzkopf, 1995 ; Smith & Kurtz, 2003 ; Staeheli et al.,
2002 ), exercising the property rights of exclusion and sale. There is a tension between
property rights and practices that cannot be fully resolved by the question of ownership,
and this merits further exploration of the concrete ways in which everyday property
practices cement into “rights, ”and for whom.
In the United States, understandings of property ownership are bound up with
Lockean notions of laboring to produce the “fruits ”of the land (Archer, 2005 ). For
Locke, private property is the result of private labors being mixed with land; this
deﬁnition prioritizes the “use, ”and “improvement ”dimensions of the multi-faceted
bundle of rights inhering in property. As Archer writes, “one could appropriate a given
parcel of land through the application of one ’s personal labor, thus turning that parcel
into private territory, the personal property of that individual, distinct and detached
from all other interests, including public or collective interests ”(2005 , p. 24). Such
Lockean logics are present in the US constitution ’s emphasis on “life and liberty ”as well
as the Homestead Act of 1862, which legalized the dispossession of native lands by
white settlers whose labor was believed to make these “underutilized ”resources more
“productive. ”A similar logic allows for the public seizure of “blighted ”urban property
from negligent owners, via eminent domain. Labor is central to Locke ’s notion of
property, but the bene ﬁts of this labor are not the sole property of the individual –
they include the common good as well (Krueckeberg, 2004 ). While often used to justify
the individual right to private property, Lockean notions of property might be usefully
repurposed to examine the collective practices (and labors) that create commons, or
shared resources (Blomley, 2008 ; Hardin, 1968 ; Ostrom, 1990 ). Conceptualizing prop-
erty as a relational practice positions the right to use, access, exclude, improve or sell, asURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1487
social negotiations and community-based practices, rather than the private rights of
autonomous individuals.
Employing this conceptualization of property as a relational practice, we ask what
practices, and by whom, generate what sorts of property regimes? By asking how people
negotiate di ﬀerent types of property relationships in urban food provisioning, we can
examine notions of shared property, and its care. Critical legal scholars and urban
geographers engage such questions through the concept of commons, which they
employ to explore the production of particular property regimes and the blurring of
public and private in community appropriations of urban land (Blomley, 2008 ; Foster,
2011 ; Huron, 2015 ; Thompson, 2015 ).
Property care, commons, and community
The relational practices that make and remake property, and signal the boundaries of
belonging and exclusion, often take the form of care. Care is a fundamentally relational
activity, and at various moments we might be asked to care for, care with, and be cared
for. The labors of property care often carry positive associations –such as stewardship
or responsibility –and may be tied up with an ethic of care towards human and non-
human others (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). A variety of institutional and social relation-
ships serve to regulate acceptable and unacceptable forms of property care, land use,
and resource governance. Care is one of the most intimate and everyday ways in which
“the logics of private property and the logics of commoning become interwoven ”(Lang,
2014 , p. 857).
Commons are community created, owned, used, governed, and cared for resources,
assets, or spaces that are stewarded by the communities that depend on them (Gibson-
Graham et al., 2013 ; McCarthy, 2005 ; Ostrom, 1990 ). Commons theory has a long
history, with origins in studies of common pool resources (CPR), such as ﬁsheries,
grazing ﬁelds, and water. The material qualities and relatively ﬁxed quantities of CPRs
mean that each user is a ﬀected by the actions of other users. If one rancher puts too
many animals on a grazing pasture there will be less food for everyone else, Hardin
(1968 ) calls this the tragedy of the commons. Ostrom ( 1990 ) argues that di ﬀerent
institutional regimes can counteract the commons “tragedy ”, and subsequent work by
a range of scholars emphasizes the variety of practices and structures that can facilitate
access to shared spaces and resources, without necessarily tragic e ﬀects (Foster, 2011 ;
Colding et al., 2013 ; Huron, 2015 ; Nightingale, 2014 ; Williams, 2018a ). At the same
time, commons scholarship has shown the limitations of this institutional approach for
examining commons as political projects and social practices, which risks reducing
commons to property and resources, and commoners to rational economic subjects
(Bollier & Helfrich, 2015 ; Velicu and García-López, 2018 ).
Increasingly property scholars are unbounding the commons in order to examine
them as socio-spatial processes rather than as a ﬁxed amount of resource in a de ﬁned
territory (Blomley, 2008 ; Bollier, 2016 ; Bresnihan, 2015 ; Crabtree, 2013 ; Gibson-
Graham et al., 2013 ). As Bollier writes, commons “is less a noun than a verb because
it is primarily about the social practices of commoning –acts of mutual support,
conﬂict, negotiation, communication and experimentation that are needed to create
systems to manage shared resources ”(2016 , p. 2). This commoning is evident in the1488 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
governance of common pool resources such as those examined by Ostrom ( 1990 ),
where the materiality qualities and ﬁnite quantities of a resource are seen as incentives
for commoning. However, a growing body of research takes the perspective of com-
moning to understand not just how shared resources are governed, but how they are
created in the ﬁrst place. In these instances, particularly in urban areas, commoning is
driven by an ethic of care and responsibility towards a diverse and potentially unknown
pool of resource users (Bresnihan & Byrne, 2015 ; Huron, 2015 ; Lang, 2014 ).
In urban studies, commons theory has been applied to examine the politics of
community gardens (Eizenberg, 2012 ), cooperatively owned housing (Huron, 2014 ,
2015 ), community land trusts (Aernouts & Ryckewaert, 2018 ; Bunce, 2016 ; Midheme
& Moulaert, 2013 ; Thompson, 2015 ), cooperatively owned businesses (Cornwell, 2012 ;
DeFilippis, 2004 ), squatter settlements (Neuwirth, 2005 ), food sharing (Morrow, 2019 ),
and even private yards and the margins of sidewalks (Blomley, 2005 ; Crawford, 1995 ;
Lang, 2014 ). According to Blomley ( 2008 ), urban commons, like all forms of property
(Blomley, 2005 ), are not found: they are made (see also Williams, 2018a ). Urban spaces
become commons when they are appropriated, cared for, managed, and shared by city
dwellers who feel not only a right to inhabit these spaces but a collective responsibility
towards them. Private spaces can become commons when their owners share the use,
access, bene ﬁts, and care of their property with a community of harvesters, food
preservers, eaters, farmers, and gardeners (see also Lang, 2014 ). They are giving up
their right to exclude others, in order to share the access and labor of sustainability and
food provisioning with a broader community. In sharing these responsibilities they
create opportunities for a broader public to make claims on their property. Practicing
urban commons thus involves negotiating access to, responsibility and care for, and
ownership of public and private urban land and its fruits.
Cities are rich in shared resources that are to varying degrees collectively produced,
used, and governed; these include material infrastructure like roads, parks, sewers, and
transportation as well as civic life, neighborhoods, art, and culture (Castells, 1977 ;
Foster, 2011 ). Public spaces like parks, streets, and sidewalks are publicly owned, but
they are not (usually) maintained, governed, regulated, or cared for by the public that
uses them, except through government agencies (Colding et al., 2013 ; Koch & Latham,
2012 ). But public spaces as well as private ones can be appropriated as commons, when
for example a group of protesters builds a tent city in a park or a group of mothers
closes o ﬀa street to make a neighborhood park (Radywyl & Biggs, 2013 ), or when
neighbors and block clubs garden vacant lots in order to improve public safety (Martin,
2002 ). These appropriations happen even in the face of privatization and intense
policing of public spaces in the United States (Holston, 2009 ; Low, 2006 ). And they
are not equally possible for all bodies, in all spaces. Yet, everyday practices of inhabi-
tance and care, temporary appropriation, and artistic intervention may also facilitate the
creation of new political spaces that allow for a wider variety of actors, concerns, claims,
and organizing styles (Crawford, 1995 ; Holston, 2009 ; Iveson, 2013 ; Martin, 2002 ;
McLean, 2017 ).
Care practices that seek to broaden land use and access in cities –for example,
planting fruit trees on public lands, harvesting berries from trees on private property, or
negotiating the use of private land for planting and harvesting –all reveal ways that
urban commoning can contest ﬁxed notions of property and territory. While theseURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1489
practices of harvesting, gleaning, and planting happen through various aspects of the
property “bundle of rights ”(use, usufruct, exclusion/inclusion), they also suggest that
urban spaces have a ﬂuidity of meanings that the categories public and private insu ﬃ-
ciently capture. This ambiguity can be an opportunity for non-owners to make use and
access claims to urban spaces. As suggested by legal scholars such as Sheila Foster
(2011 ) and Nicholas Blomley ( 2005 ,2008 ), urban spaces are sites for the construction of
many types of meanings, from commoditized territory-as-property to public-tended or
public-neglected, ripe for collective care and commoning (Foster, 2011 ). In such fram-
ings, ownership is less the salient concept than use, care, and responsibility.
Practices of care are especially evident in the sustainability practices of urban home-
steaders, which include food provisioning and environmental stewardship in cities.
Such activities are often embedded in notions of (privatized) responsibility and care
for health, home, and family, articulated through the quotidian practices of food work
and social reproduction (Parker & Morrow, 2017 ). But they can also be enrolled in
a broader ethic of care for community well-being and non-human nature (Morrow &
Dombroski, 2015 ). Examining practices of urban food provisioning in the context of
urban commons, as we do in this paper, can deepen our understanding of socio-spatial
practices that make (and contest) the meanings and boundaries of both public and
private property, and create spaces of shared use and care in urban areas. Thus, creating
new social relations and property regimes that might counter the privatizing (and
policing) impulse of property care, and redirect care work towards the commons.
Urban homesteading is a sustainable lifestyle movement that places household
provisioning at the center of social and environmental change (Coyne & Knutzen,
2010 ; Kaplan & Blume, 2011 ; Parker & Morrow, 2017 ). Homesteaders self-provision
foods at home, but also grow, harvest, forage, and glean from urban spaces that include
community gardens and everyday spaces like sidewalks, property edges, conservation
land, vacant lots, community land trusts, and shared yards. While rescaling environ-
mental responsibility to the home, practices of food provisioning and environmental
care also provide new opportunities for reimagining, and thus creating and practicing,
urban public and private spaces as commons. Examining these practices at the edge of
public and private property may o ﬀer new ways of understanding the politics of
property and community in the making of commons.
Producing commons in greater Boston: case studies
Drawing on ethnographic research with households, community organizations, and
businesses involved in urban homesteading and agriculture in greater Boston,
Massachusetts, the remainder of this paper addresses the following questions: how are
urban food commons articulated through negotiating access, responsibility, care, and
ownership, by whom, and in what kinds of spaces? We seek to understand how urban
spaces, with diverse forms of ownership, are practiced as commons –even if only
temporarily. We argue that property care and property rights are mutually reinforcing,
where practicing responsible environmental stewardship enables particular individuals
and communities to claim the right to use and care for urban spaces as commons.
These rights and practices inhere in the politics of who negotiates and obtains access,
and to what sort of urban space. Negotiations around use and access are shaped by1490 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
relations between and among users and owners, including dynamics around race, class,
and ethnicity, which can create a di ﬀerentiated and unequal right to the city.
Between 2011 and 2013, the ﬁrst author conducted 40 interviews about self-
provisioning practices such as urban gardening, chicken and beekeeping, food preser-
vation, and foraging with urban homesteaders, as well as initiatives and businesses
involved in urban agriculture in greater Boston, a national hub for higher education.2
Interviewees tended to be highly educated, the majority were white, and they lived in
Cambridge and Somerville (majority white), Roxbury and Dorchester (majority black),
and Jamaica Plain (majority white). The majority of urban agriculture projects pro ﬁled
here are led by white residents with access to social and economic privilege. These
include City Growers, an urban farming social enterprise that grows food on city-
owned vacant lots; the League of Urban Canners ( 2014 ), a food provisioning collective
that harvests and preserves food from mostly privately owned fruit trees (receives no
funding); The Urban Homesteaders League, a skill sharing network and events listing
that promotes household sustainability through self-provisioning (founded by a woman
of color); The Boston Tree Party, a non-pro ﬁt that encourages the planting of heirloom
apple trees in public and privately owned community spaces as civic fruit (led by the
founder of UHL); Earth Works, a non-pro ﬁt that plants fruit trees in public spaces to
promote environmental education and stewardship (they closed in 2010)3; Egleston
Community Orchard ( 2014 ), a neighborhood-run open access food forest on a city-
owned vacant lot; My City Gardens, a social enterprise that connects landless gardeners
with sunny, privately owned yards; and Yardbirds, a business that farms in private
urban and suburban backyards (they relocated to Western MA in 2013) (see Table 1 ).
The diversity of organizations in this study, all of which seek some combination of
access to urban land for food growing or harvesting and/or collective strategies for
urban homesteading, point to the varieties of care, stewardship, and responsibility being
practiced by di ﬀerent groups of people, on both public and private land in metropolitan
Boston.
In the course of the research, the ﬁrst author conducted participant observation at
a number of food provisioning sites, including private, public, and community gardens;
public parks and sidewalks; urban farms; private and community kitchens. Interactions
with participants allowed the research to document existing practices of commoning as
well as contribute to the emergence and visibility of new commons.
To analyze the various practices and negotiations that make property –and commons –we
employ Gibson-Graham, Cameron, and Healy ’s“Commons Identikit ”(2013)( s e e Table 1 ),
which is organized around the di ﬀerent dimensions of property use, access, ownership, care,
beneﬁt, and responsibility. Building on Ostrom ’s(1990) typology for analyzing di ﬀerent
common property regimes, Gibson-Graham, Cameron, and Healy ’st o o l “unbundles ”the
diverse practices that make up property. These practices can help to de ﬁne or challenge
particular property rights and open up multiple entry points for cultivating more collective
approaches to land as property. This tool for unbundling property aligns with our concep-
tualization of property a sar e l a t i o n a lp r a c t i c e .
In our analysis, ownership rights of access, use, usufruct, and exclusion are recog-
nized as important, but other practices play an equally important role in making
property and negotiating meaning and access. For example, practices of stewardship
and care by owners and non-owners are also important elements of urban land use.URBAN GEOGRAPHY 1491

Table 1 provides a summary of all the di ﬀerent dimensions of property we observed
among urban homesteaders and urban agriculture organizations in Boston, following
the framework laid out by Gibson-Graham, Cameron, and Healy. Bolded activities are
discussed in the empirical sections of this paper. In the sections that follow, we describe
urban food commons in the making, examining how property practices coalesce into
rights in negotiations over property access, responsibility and care, and ownership.
Practicing commons, practicing care
In greater Boston, common practices include harvesting, sharing, cooking, eating, and
caring for the fruits of public and private property on sidewalks, and in parks, vacant
lots, schoolyards, backyards and front yards. Working on a range of property tenure
types, food provisioning is one of the ways that urban homesteaders make property
claims on urban space. They may enclose public space as community space, steward
urban environments, harvest fruits through usufruct, and practice “nomadic ”forms of
use, access, and sharing through foraging. As is clear from Table 1 , food provisioning is
practiced on a range of property types. Whether resources are publicly or privately
owned, commoning involved negotiating terms of access, use, and responsibility, via
speciﬁc forms of request or practices to enact use rights.
Negotiating access and use
One of the foundational rights of private property ownership is the right to exclude
others. However, less visible, but equally important, is the corollary right to include
others. These rights are practiced in negotiations around property access between
landowners and urban foragers, harvesters, farmers, and gardeners. In the context of
urban commons, these negotiations take place within a collective of people and plants
that extends beyond the individual.
For the League of Urban Canners (LURC, 2014 ), an urban food provisioning
collective that harvests and preserves about 4000 pounds of backyard fruit in
Cambridge and Somerville each summer, negotiating access to privately owned fruit
trees and grape arbors means ﬁnding out where they are located, who owns them (if
anyone), and asking for permission. LURC locates backyard fruit through public events,
posting ﬂiers on telephone poles, word of mouth, and walking and biking around town.
LURC asks for permission by knocking on doors and asking owners if they harvest their
fruit, and o ﬀers to harvest surplus fruit and give owners 10% of the preserved product
(usually jam) in return. LURC maintains their right to access these trees by maintaining
good relationships with the property owners. Good relationships mean caring for the
tree, cleaning up debris or rotting fruit, clear communication, inviting property owners
to community dinners, and making sure that they receive their share of the preserved
harvest. Inclusion, responsibility, care, and sharing are property practices created
through these relationships. The relationships are initiated by LURC volunteers, who
then enroll property owners in cooperative practices of usufruct and stewardship.
Several social enterprises4use formal permissions and leases to access land for urban
agriculture and gardening. The social enterprise City Growers, accesses vacant lots for
urban farming by paying a fee to lease lots from their owners, which include neighbors,1494 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
the city, non-pro ﬁts, and community land trusts. Yardbirds is a small business that
grows food in urban and suburban backyards to sell at farmers markets. As beginner
farmers, the Yardbirds did not have the ﬁnancial capital to buy or lease land. To access
land they partnered with homeowners to farm their yards; in exchange homeowners
received a CSA share of the harvest. My City Gardens is a social enterprise that
facilitates yard sharing by connecting landless gardeners with sunny yards. It is up to
each pair of property owners and gardeners to negotiate the terms of access. In each of
these cases, private property rights to exclude/include form the basis of initial access
negotiations: Owners are contacted and receive a bene ﬁt from sharing access to and use
of their property. At the same time, they o ﬀer rights of inclusion to a larger number of
(not necessarily known) people. These relationships simultaneously expand property
practices and social engagement, around access and stewardship.
Not everyone negotiates access or asks for permission to harvest fruit or use land (as
also noted in Thompson, 2015 ). Where the boundaries between public and private are
ambiguous, access may be de ﬁned by proximity and use –and resources may be
appropriated or taken without permission, as when Rick harvests berries from branches
overhanging a sidewalk (as noted in the introduction). Rick (who is white), feels safe
enough to encroach upon private property by taking its overhanging fruit. So do
a group of elderly Chinese women, who have been guerilla gardening the neglected
edges of a fenceless community garden in Cambridge. They are not members of this
garden, which has a long waiting list, but their encroachment on these marginal lands is
tolerated (interview with community garden manager). However, if they were to help
themselves to blueberries grown in the garden, the way Rick does, that might be
another story.
The privilege to trespass, take, and encroach is not equally distributed in US society.
Black and brown people are heavily policed and surveilled in cities and neighborhoods,
in ways that are dangerous and continue to deny large swathes of society the right to the
city and its fruits. These racialized property “care ”practices have made white privilege
a condition of property use and access. In US cities, dynamics of race and class privilege
shape how urban commons are created, negotiated, and by whom. And informal and
illicit property practices might be especially vulnerable to bias and discrimination, with
little transparency or criteria for inclusion. These dynamics are not always considered
in the complex interpersonal work that is involved in accessing, rede ﬁning, and policing
the commons, leading critical scholars to ask what an antiracist commons might look
like? (Maskovsky, 2017 , p. 49).
Stewardship: responsibility and care
Maintaining commons and governing how they are used, accessed, and cared for brings
questions of stewardship to the fore. In formally negotiated commons, the stewardship
duties and obligations of resource users are de ﬁned and clearly allocated among
a community. In property theory, responsibility and care are often assumed to be an
outcome of private property ownership (Archer, 2005 ; Keenan, 2010 ). In actuality,
responsibility cannot be assumed to follow proximity or legal title; instead, it is some-
thing to be negotiated. Increasingly such negotiations are enabled by a neoliberal urban
governance environment that favors grassroots and civil forms of environmentalURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1495
stewardship and responsibility to ﬁll gaps in municipal services (Rosol, 2012 ). In this
study, we ﬁnd several initiatives with distinct approaches to stewarding urban fruit trees
in open access and privately owned commons.
When Earthworks started in the early 1970s, its mission was to enhance urban food
security and promote environmental stewardship by planting fruit trees in public spaces
like schools, parks, and community centers. These values are also re ﬂected in contemporary
eﬀorts to green cities and engage citizens through urban tree planting (Fisher, Svendsen, &
Connolly, 2015 ). As one former employee notes, “The organization started out with this
kind of wide-eyed vision of just, ‘Let’sj u s t –plant fruit trees everywhere! And it ’ll be
amazing! And people will eat them ’”(Interview with author). The fruit trees were planted as
gifts in socially and economically marginalized and food insecure neighborhoods that were
lacking in trees. What Earthworks had not considered was that the community members in
these neighborhoods, often renters, did not have the desire, permanence, time, or ability to
care for or harvest from these trees. The organization thus shifted from “trying to ﬁnd
people who want to take care of plants. . . to just taking care of plants ”(interview with
author). The care-gap that Earthworks faced highlights the di ﬀerence between commons as
an o u n( a ﬁxed pool of resources like fruit) and commons as a verb (the practice of
collectively creating a shared resource and caring for it).
Planting fruit trees in under-resourced neighborhoods in order to make residents
care for the environment will not necessarily generate stewardship or community well-
being. As Heynen, Perkins, and Roy ( 2006 ) and Braverman ( 2008 ) chronicle, the civic
and environmental “beneﬁts”of urban trees are sometimes resented by low-income
communities who see them as nuisances, safety concerns, or drivers of gentri ﬁcation. In
the case of Earthworks ’trees, with no one to care for them, the fruit trees grew wild and
unpicked fruit fell to the ground where it attracted pests (interview with author). The
assumption behind the tree planting was that commons would generate commoning
when in the fact the reverse is true.
In wealthier neighborhoods, the responsibility for commoning fruit trees also
requires negotiation. In suburban Boston, Margaret convinced her neighbors to plant
fruit trees and berry bushes as part of a neighborhood fruit orchard. She did so by
reframing plants as neighborhood amenities that would enhance community and
environmental well-being. There are now 34 fruit trees and bushes growing on her
neighbor ’s front lawns in locations that are accessible from the sidewalk. Because the
plants are on private property, homeowners are responsible for them. But the respon-
sibility for organizing the community, managing con ﬂicts, and governing how the
individual plants are accessed and cared for continues to fall on Margaret, who says,
“I really want the whole community to take ownership. . . I want to pass it on to
someone else. I don ’t need to own it, you know ”(interview with author). The di ﬃculty
that Margaret faces in “passing it on ”reﬂects more than her neighbors unwillingness to
take responsibility –it also suggests discomfort with the ambiguity of (informal)
collective ownership.
Ifprivate care is what makes private property, perhaps community care is what
makes a commons. In cases where property rights are absent or ambiguous, property
care can be a means of making a property claim (Blomley, 2008 ; Staeheli et al., 2002 ). In
Margaret ’s neighborhood, the fruits are shared among neighborhood children but
responsibility and care are not. This may pose challenges to the long-term sustainability1496 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
of this resource and allow property owners to withdraw their fruits and exclude
unwanted harvesters and strangers. The result could be an exclusionary neighborhood
commons, or simply conventional private property.
In other parts of Boston, vacant lots are being appropriated and reclaimed through
community care. Community groups like the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative
have played a critical role in introducing new forms of community land ownership and
governance, which enable urban agriculture and a ﬀordable housing. And neighbors and
non-pro ﬁts like Alternatives for Community and Environment continue to organize to
stop dumping, clean up and police vacant lots, and claim a say over their use. Although
most of the vacant lots in Boston are owned by the city, they are not always cared for by
the city. The Egleston Community Orchard (ECO, 2014 )i s “a neighborhood-led e ﬀort
for sustainable urban agriculture and green space, promoting environmental justice and
community ownership of land in Egleston Square ”(ECO website). By caring for ECO,
neighbors and volunteers participate in property practices, such as cleaning up trash,
planting fruit trees, participating in work days, negotiating with neighbors for water,
and using the lot for education ( ﬁeld notes). At ECO, practices of property care extend
to both urban nature and the neighborhood. Foster ( 2011 ) notes that these types of
collective action over public land are enabled particularly in cases of “regulatory
slippage ”, when public stewards fail to provide services or care.
Although they are privately owned, backyards can also be sites of community care.
The League of Urban Canners (LURC, 2014 ) cares for the private trees it harvests
throughout the year in order to enhance trust (of property owners, assuring continued
access) as well as fruit production. After their ﬁrst year, they noticed that many of the
trees they harvested were neglected and not producing very much fruit. In response,
they recruited a permaculturalist who held several workshops on tree pruning. Now
LURC provides organic pest management and o ﬀers tree pruning each winter. Through
these practices LURC helps to maintain and improve the commons it bene ﬁts from,
while casting themselves as responsible stewards. In doing so, they actively produce
a commons whose bene ﬁts are widely shared despite the seemingly straightforward and
private status of the properties where the trees are living. LURC stewards tend to be
young and white, while property owners represent a mix of older immigrants from the
Mediterranean and the Caribbean and upper middle class white gentri ﬁers.
Who owns? Who bene ﬁts?
Although “commons ”implies an ambiguous and open public, the stewardship of land
can also establish a community that cares in ways that explicitly exclude, even on public
property. Karen and Isaac live in a town outside of Boston, where they keep chickens
and bees, and garden their yard intensively. At the edge of their urban homestead, there
are some high bushes and trees separating their garden from conservation land,
a roadway, and a river. On several afternoons they noticed lone men sitting in parked
cars behind their house drinking alcohol, which usually ended with the men urinating
through the publicly owned bushes and into their private garden. The urban wilds these
conservation lands were meant to protect were too unkempt for Karen and Isaac, in
addition to blocking valuable sunlight from entering the garden. As property owners
and neighbors they became concerned about the danger these potentially drunk driversURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1497
posed to their community –especially neighborhood children who use this road to
reach the playground. So Karen and Isaac began thinning out the bushes and pruning
the trees, in order to let more sunlight in, hopefully keep urine out, and expand their
garden plots. Thinning out the urban wilds also created a line of sight between the
roadway and the house, which they hoped would make roadside drinkers feel watched
(ﬁeld notes).
Should we interpret Karen and Isaac ’s garden expansion and tree pruning as
stewardship or encroachment? As neighbors they felt a civic responsibility for public
safety, to keep the public lands around their property clean and safe. As gardeners
they wanted more sunlight and land for growing food. And as private property
owners, they wanted to protect the public lands around their home from litter and
inappropriate uses. As Lang ( 2014 ) shows in her research on the commoning
practices in private yards, it is precisely through these mundane forms of property
care that the logics of private property and the commons are interwoven. Yet, as
Lang also argues, the inclusiveness of these commons depends also on our scale of
analysis. At the neighborhood scale, these forms of property care might encourage
commons. For example, under Karen and Isaac ’s care the pruned trees have grown
healthier, the soil has been fertilized, and the number of empty beer and liquor
bottles has decreased. Land that was previously open access is now surveilled and
privately managed by this household.
But at the urban scale, creating a neighborhood space for plants, chickens, and
children to grow in has meant the enclosure of public lands and the subtle exclusion
of other users with equal right to this stretch of urban nature. These everyday forms of
policing may seem relatively benign, but also ﬁt the pattern of everyday and often
racialized policing of urban space by ordinary white people who want to keep the
community pool, co ﬀee shop, or secluded public parkland for themselves. On the
surface, making a space uncomfortable for drinking and urinating may be good for
the public. But it also means that private citizens are deciding what sort of public
actions are appropriate and what are not. The tending of public space by private
abutters such as Karen and Isaac might send an exclusionary message to other potential
users of the park, people who are not interesting in public drinking, but who are not
sure their presence will be tolerated by nearby owners, and –out of fear of their own
safety –don ’t want to ﬁnd out. Meanwhile, although the land bears material traces of
Karen and Isaac ’s care –pruned trees, raised beds, and a beehive –the state land
managers have not commented.
The ability of community members to practice property care (as private citizens and
community organizations), is due in part to inadequate care these spaces receive from
their legal owners,5both public and private. In the case of public land, these voluntary
forms of urban and environmental care help close a gap in state and city services, but
they are not a replacement for such services. Furthermore, they may open the possibi-
lity for private groups and individuals to claim a say over public resources in ways that
explicitly exclude. As previous research on the role of public –private partnerships in
managing parks has shown, private care of public space can indeed make those spaces
very exclusionary (Németh & Schmidt, 2011 ). At the same time, however, these gaps in
care –both public and private –open the possibilities for a community to share, care
for, and govern these spaces as commons.1498 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
City Growers faced the issue of sharing land through its e ﬀorts to farm vacant land.
Although the city owns most of the 50 acres of vacant lots in Boston, it is households
and community organizations who care for them and feel ownership over them. Vacant
lots are thus subject to multiple and competing forms of formal and informal owner-
ship. When the urban farming enterprise City Growers decided to start farming on
vacant lots, they were aware of these overlapping property claims and chose to privilege
the care practices of community members, by negotiating access and use with neighbors
(abutters, community organizations, and non-pro ﬁts) before asking the legal owner the
City of Boston for permission to lease the lot. As Margaret (who is also organized the
neighborhood orchard) explains:
Because the land was vacant for so long in these neighborhoods, people who live in those
neighborhoods feel a sense of ownership. The idea of the commons is coming back. . . The
mayor may think this piece of land is a city lot but it ’s the neighborhood [which] has been
caring for it, preventing crime from happening on it, all of those things. What ’s happening
is, that the neighborhood, people in the neighborhood want a farm there (interview with
author).
The Egleston Community Orchard is engaged in the kinds of neighborhood property
care that Margaret describes above. However, ECO members also recognize the vulner-
ability of informal ownership, and in partnership with other neighborhood forest-
garden organizations in their area, have incorporated as the Boston Food Forest
Coalition, a non-pro ﬁt community land trust that facilitates community land steward-
ship for edible public parks. Community land trusts are necessary for protecting these
spaces from the unintended consequences of property care and environmental steward-
ship, especially gentri ﬁcation (ECO website, interviews, Boston Food Forest Coalition
website). Yet land trusts themselves also must manage issues around membership and
community decision-making about land in their care (DeFilippis et al., 2019 ; Williams,
2018b ).
Urban fruit trees are also subject to multiple forms of ownership and tenuous
protections. While LURC engages in much of the labor and responsibility of property
ownership through practices of tree care, it does not own the trees it harvests or the
land they grow on. This point was made quite clear when several homeowners and
a university decided to chop down fruit trees being harvested by LURC. Despite being
stewards of these trees for several years, LURC had no property claim to them and
could not prevent their removal. This was disappointing to LURC members who cared
about these trees and who wished that the university had considered community and
environmental needs in its landscaping and maintenance decisions. In response, one
member suggested that LURC looks for semi-public spaces where fruit trees could be
planted and harvested but owned by no one ( ﬁeld notes).
The challenges of private ownership extend beyond care and long-term protection,
highlighting the di ﬀerential status of owners and users. The negotiations around the use of
trees and the distribution of their fruits produce some tensions in LURC. Currently,
preserved fruit is distributed with 10% going to the property owner, 20% going to the
harvesters, and 70% going to the preservers (since this is the most time-consuming and
expensive activity). The labor and socio-spatial relations that develop around food provi-
sioning also in ﬂuence how people feel about fruit ownership and equity. For LURC theURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1499
labor of harvesting and pruning trees is a collective e ﬀort, and the resulting fruits are
recognized as the collective property of LURC. Harvesting is regarded as a fun family
activity, a low-carbon alternative to driving out to an orchard to pick your own apples in
the fall ( ﬁeld notes). But when these fruits are taken home to private kitchens and
processed into jam, they are being transformed into collective, yet separate commodities
or property. In contrast to the collective and public leisure of harvesting, the labor of
preserving jam can feel like work, especially when it is done at home alone in a hot kitchen.
On several occasions, preservers6have been less than willing to part with the
products of their domestic labor. After mixing their personal labor with the fruit, in
their home kitchens, and paying for canning supplies, sugar and spices, gas and
electricity, some of the canners (all women) felt the jam was rightfully theirs for the
keeping. Several other women have objected to the 10% distribution to property owners
in more politicized language, calling it “feudalism ”and “share cropping. ”In their view,
the property owner has invested no labor in the process, so why should they bene ﬁtb y
virtue of owning property? Their justi ﬁcation drew on Lockean notions of property
ownership to remove fruit from the common after improving it with private labor. In
their accounting, they had labored (and cared) much more than the property owner and
the collective of harvesters who would enjoy their jam. In making a property claim on
the fruit, these women were perhaps drawing attention to the potential for exploitation
in informal property arrangements and claiming their own (bourgeois) economic
identities outside the bounds of feudalism. Or perhaps they were enacting a feminist
politics by bringing attention to the ways in which both the feudal property lord and the
collective of harvesters drew bene ﬁt from the care work and domestic labor of women.
However, this con ﬂict may also reveal broader challenges of justly sharing something as
material and intimate as food (Morrow, 2019 ).
The disputes and tensions over jam illustrate and highlight that, despite the spirit
and discourse of commoning in LURC and other organizations, ownership matters
a great deal in determining how commons are accessed, governed, used, cared for, and
how common goods are distributed. In order to preserve commons as community
assets, communities may wish to become the legal owners of the commons they steward
and depend on (Midheme & Moulaert, 2013 ; Thompson, 2015 ). Doing so preserves the
commons for its members, but also codi ﬁes exclusions beyond the membership. It also
codiﬁes stewardship, an essential element for the sustainability of the commons. Indeed,
jam production can be seen as an element of stewardship of the literal fruits of the land,
and thus, of the value of the land. But, the desire for a collective land title should not be
confused with neoliberal forms of land titling that work to formalize and individualize
informal forms of collective ownership (Pierce, 2010 ), producing even more exclusions.
Community Land Trusts o ﬀer one example of collective ownership which retains group
access and contracts stewardship of the land.
Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we explored how a variety of urban food provisioning practices are
opening up private and public spaces to negotiations around access and use, responsi-
bility and care, bene ﬁts and ownership. Urban property theorists have problematized
the idea that the commons exist independent of the collective practices that bring them1500 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
into being. Yet, collective practices of care, conviviality, and sociality are rarely articu-
lated or recognized as property practices.
Approaching urban commons from the perspective of practice reveals a variegated
landscape of ambiguous and “unbundled ”property rights; an unbundling that, we
argue, is necessary for commons practices to occur. This paper has examined how
urban food initiatives in greater Boston navigate and reimagine the property/commons
landscape by negotiating access to, responsibility and care for, and ownership of urban
land for food provisioning. These practices reveal an uneven geography of property
rights, in which embodiment, belonging, and privilege shape to our ability to recon ﬁ-
gure property regimes, and perform commons as the foraging ﬂaneur, the responsible
steward, the yard police, the anti-gentri ﬁcation gardener, and the food sharer. These
roles and practices are unevenly accessible and express social dynamics of inclusion/
exclusion.
Property access is spatially and temporally contingent, and negotiated at the bound-
aries of public and private through practices of knowledge, proximity, and community.
In practice, access is limited to key individuals and groups and their conceptualizations
and negotiations of public and private. Despite noticing mulberries overhanging the
sidewalk, not all urban dwellers will feel comfortable to pick and eat them. For those
who eat these mulberries by the mouthful, the public commons is whatever can be
grabbed, picked, and touched from the sidewalk. Feeling comfortable to harvest and
garden across property lines (Blomley, 2005 ) or knock on a stranger ’s door to ask for
food can be the result of social privilege, including race,7derived from belonging to
a particular political, cultural, or taste community.
Indeed, when knowledge, food, and land are deliberately shared and managed as
commons it is within the boundaries of community, rather than an explicit opening to
(just) anyone (Thompson, 2015 ). Commons are only as accessible and inclusive as the
communities that govern them. The communities we describe here are mostly white,
and sharing often occurs across shared commitments related to local food, sustain-
ability, alternative economies, and sometimes the commons. The persistent whiteness of
alternative food networks as well as solidarity economy initiatives is well documented
(Borowiak, Healy, & Pavlovskaya, 2018 ; Slocum, 2007 ). These dynamics, combined with
highly unequal distribution of property ownership and more subtle forms of policing
and bias, pose signi ﬁcant barriers for inclusivity in urban commons.
The ambiguous commons we have discussed here highlight the need for greater atten-
tion to care in the property “bundle of rights. ”F o ru r b a nh o m e s t e a d e r s ,c a r ei saf e e l i n g ,
a kind of labor, and a power relation. As a form of ecological citizenship, care manifests
itself as a feeling of responsibility towards the urban environment and all those who make it
t h e i rh o m e( L i g h t , 2003 ). Care is work, which is necessary for reproducing the commons
and the communities that use them. In greater Boston, some people and organizations are
caring for the commons by cleaning, weeding, pruning, gardening, and policing urban
nature. And owners, land managers, neighbors, and community organizations take respon-
sibility for regulating how property care is practiced, where, and by whom.
Through practicing stewardship, urban homesteaders create urban environments
that are healthy, beautiful, and comfortable for some, but not all, urban inhabitants.
This incomplete reworking of property makes evident the ongoing and un ﬁnished work
of enabling and enacting informal urban commons. Urban food provisioning presentsURBAN GEOGRAPHY 1501
a novel case for exploring how everyday practices can create new commons, and for
understanding the role of community and environmental care in performing a wide
range of property practices. Commons o ﬀer a view on the relationality of property
rights and practices, and the capacity for communities to produce new property regimes
and ways of relating to urban nature.
In this paper, we have identi ﬁed urban food practices that shape commons in
negotiations around use and access, responsibility and care, and bene ﬁts and ownership
in urban space. Ownership of urban land, trees, and their fruit is formal and informal,
felt, imagined, and performed. Ownership is felt by community organizations and
households who perform the role of good property stewards through care, responsi-
bility, and use, even in the absence of formal property rights. Ownership is also
material; when individuals labor to transform urban nature into gardens and jam
they feel (private and collective) ownership over these spaces and things. Finally,
ownership is still formal. Property performances are interrupted when land is sold,
community trees are felled, and care is leveraged to make formal property claims.
Indeed, processes of commoning iterate and rely upon private property rights in order
to produce an alternative; thus commons and individual ownership can even be
mutually reinforcing. As Lang ( 2014 ) observes of informally shared and stewarded
yards in Minneapolis, the logics of commoning and the logics of private property are
often interwoven. Urban food provisioning exposes the constituent legal bundle of
rights in its parts (bundles), loosening them to make explicit spaces for collective,
community use and access.
Notes
1.Community gardeners have indeed been successful in securing long-term access to the
land they steward through community land trusts and long-term leases from city, one
example is the Greenthumb program in New York City.
2.Individuals and organizations who are well known to the broader public for their work
(e.g. through their local media pro ﬁle) are recognized. All other individuals are referred to
with pseudonyms.
3.Data about this organization are drawn from an interviewee with a former employee and
printed materials.
4.A social enterprise is a business that is oriented around social objectives rather than pro ﬁt.
5.For example, in the city of Cambridge where LURC harvests fruit and also advocates
for the planting of more public fruit trees there is only one arborist. The city arborist
does not see the need for more public fruit trees, which in his view require too much
care.
6.In LURC preservers are people who take some of the harvest home and agree to preserve it
insome fashion (canning, dehydrating, fermenting, etc.). Food preservation is done by
women and men, and many men have learned how to preserve food through participating
in LURC. Many women in LURC have prior experience preserving food. In the “jam
ﬁghts ”all of the preservers have been women.
7.For African Americans in the US knocking on a stranger ’sdoor to ask for anything can be
extremely dangerous.1502 O. MORROW AND D. G. MARTIN
