Australia ABSTRACT  
Agriculture policies in Australia have long encouraged productivist agriculture that aims to maximise yields 
through intensive production. Many have argued Australian farmers are trapped on the productivist treadmill as 
a result and there is evidence of an Australian farming culture where productivism is internalised as the standard 
of good farming. In this paper, I share the stories and experiences of commercial farmers in two regions of rural 
Australia who view good farming as production that moves them away from extractive productivism and towards 
a way of producing food that lets them and their non-human counterparts survive well.   
1.Introduction 
There has been no shortage of examination of the various political 
economic -ism and -ion forces (my own included) that have driven 
Australian farmers to productivist agriculture to survive. Productivist 
agriculture, or productivism, is ‘super-charged, homogenous and mon-
ofunctional [agriculture] … shaped by the practices of high input and 
yielding, highly technical, narrowly profit-orientated agri-business ’ 
(Mackay and Perkins 2019 , 9). Neoliberalism, globalisation, trade lib-
eralisation, and more recently financialisation, have squeezed Australia 
farmers to chase ‘efficiencies ’, intensify and specialise farming practices, 
become indebted, adopt ‘innovative ’ models of production, and get big 
or get out (e.g. Haggerty et al., 2009 ; Lawrence et al. 2013 ; Larder et al. 
2018 ). Many have argued Australian farmers are ‘trapped ’ on the pro-
ductivist treadmill due to these various historical and on-going political 
economic and financial structures. However, at the level of the producer, 
the kinds of pure productivist tendencies observed at the macro level 
have been harder to pin down and there are numerous examples of 
Australian producers who have resisted the pressure towards producti -
vism. Such farmers incorporate a diverse set of values, ethics, beliefs and 
practices in their farming practice that disrupt the productivist 
abstraction. Many have underscored the inherent diversity of values and 
practices of urban food production in public and private spaces where 
growers have carved out islands of ecological liveliness that support 
various forms of economic exchange, enhance social cohesion and 
connection, and ensure continuity of culture (e.g. Kingsley and Town -
send 2007 ; Cameron et al. 2014 ; Larder et al. 2014 ; Nursey-Bray et al., 2015 ; van Holstein 2017 ; Kingsley et al. 2020 ). Explorations of rural 
producers who incorporate these diverse values have found farmers who 
are chasing watershed restoration (Andrews 2008 ; Graham and Bartel 
2017 ), escalating efforts to repair soils (Massey 2017 ), specialising in 
regenerating native pastures (Purvis 1986 ; Gosnell et al. 2019 ), and 
adapting settler-colonial practices to suite Indigenous hybrid economies 
of farming (Gill 2005 ). Ancient and ever present care of country prac-
ticed by First nations peoples has long included diverse and evolving 
agricultural activities (Gammage 2011 ; Pascoe 2014). First nations 
agriculture is inherently socially embedded and blends economic ac-
tivities with cultural practices reflective of the hybrid nature of Indig -
enous land management more broadly (Altman 2001 ; Buchanan 2014). 
In the same vein, settler-colonial rural settings are never homogenous: 
even in so-called “super productivist ” landscapes, the fact that people 
live and labour in these spaces means production is not easily disen -
tangled from ‘other ’ beliefs about what the rural is for and associated 
practices (Mackay and Perkins 2019 ). Geographers, such as Holmes and 
Argent have also demonstrated the multifunctionality of rural spaces 
(Holmes 2002 , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 ; Argent 2011 ). Farmers ’ engagement 
in the National Landcare Program, an agri-environmental scheme, is 
further evidence of the already-existing diversity of values and moti-
vations within commercial agriculture in Australia, reflecting as it does 
that production and environmental care can co-exist on farms. Finally, 
in the last decade regenerative agriculture that seeks to repair soil health 
has emerged as a definitive ‘type ’ of farming although iterations have 
been practiced in Australia for decades (e.g. see Purvis 1986 ). Together 
these practices suggest that good farming in Australia is more than a

150market-orientated activity aimed at ever higher yields to maximise 
commercial surplus. Building on these examples and drawing on in-
terviews with commercial farmers in two regions of rural Australia, this 
paper argues for a culture of farming that considers ‘good’ to be sur-
viving well. This work thus contributes to an understanding of good 
farming in Australia that directly challenges existing notions of good 
farmer as productivist agriculture. 
2.Perspectives on good farming 
Good farming is a socio-cultural construct that captures a particular 
set of beliefs and assumptions about what it means to do ‘good’ farming 
and be a ‘good’ farmer. Good farming necessarily includes a set of 
concomitant practices (for example management styles, work ethic, 
incorporation of non-traditional ideas) through which a farmer’s 
‘goodness’ is judged. In early work on the good farmer Burton (2004) 
argued that in order to understand the persistence of particular farming 
cultures over time, scholarship needed to move beyond economic and 
structural explanations of agricultural transitions and change to take 
account of the ways in which certain agricultural beliefs and practices 
confers social reward and cultural status on farmers. Farming practices 
are, Burton argued (2004, p. 198) ‘not only functional, but also over-
whelmingly expressive’ and help farmers to locate themselves within the 
group of ‘farmer’. The need to belong acts as a powerful check on human 
behaviour because failure to display ‘appropriate’ social behaviours or 
reflect accepted social symbols is met with disapproval by others in the 
community. For some farmers, being ‘good’ is at the heart of their social 
standing and they can feel shame and experience social stigma when 
their farming practices (however defined) are not aligned with the rest 
of the community (Phillips 1998; Graham and Rogers 2017). Burton and 
colleagues have used the good farmer concept to explore the role that 
socio-cultural frameworks play in agricultural transitions arguing that 
such frameworks are critical for explaining the persistence of produc -
tivism (Burton 2004; Burton et al. 2008; Burton and Paragahawewa 
2011). 
At the macro-level of rural governance in Australia, intensive, profit- 
oriented, productivist agriculture has long been encouraged as ‘good’ 
farming. Governments have supported productivist agriculture since 
colonisation when the farm sector was positioned as a cornerstone of 
economic and social development (Argent 2002). While governments’ 
support for agriculture has ebbed and flowed over time, agricultural 
policy support for ever increasing production has remained largely 
consistent, supported by scientific research, technological advances and 
more recently big data. The take-up of the productivism ideal as good 
farming is evident at the level of the farmer. Research into the good 
farmer in Australia is limited but has found that good farming is syn-
onymous with the instrumental and financial goals of productivist 
farming; good farmers are those who work hard, achieve high yields, 
make good profits, keep their farms neat and tidy, and invest in capital 
expansion (Phillips 1998). This ideal holds for both family and corporate 
farmers (c.f. Sippel et al. 2017). 
Yet farmers are not a collective, undifferentiated victim of produc -
tivist logics and policies. There are myriad producers, some noted above, 
for whom farming is about much more than production for profit max-
imisation. To date descriptions of the good farmer as productivist have 
largely failed to account for such farming cultures. For example, while 
the productivist good farmer ideal in Australia has been used to explain 
the lack of farmer engagement in on-farm conservation practice and 
voluntary agri-environmental schemes (e.g. Wilson 2004), it doesn’t 
satisfactorily account for all those farmers who have engaged in such 
schemes and who are very likely to experience the same desire for social 
acceptance as their productivist good farmer counterparts. This suggest 
that while farming cultures may be geographically extensive, indicators 
of good farming can differ from place to place (a pointed noted by both 
Phillips (1998) and Sutherland and Darhnhofer (2012)). Accounting for 
these divergent constructions of the good farmer is the key contribution of this paper. 
My interest in commercial farmers who think farming as more than 
productivism grew out of my experiences living in regional Australia 
during on-going drought between 2016 and 2019. Over the course of the 
drought, as the landscape became drier and dustier and whole swathes 
of hillsides held dead and dying trees, a noticeable malaise settled over 
the regional community in which I live. Dis-ease manifested in my body 
and I felt sensitised to climatic change in a way I couldn’t recall previ -
ously. This is not unusual according to Erev (2019, 838) who says that: ‘ 
… material process of planetary change reverberates in our bodies, 
affecting subterranean habits of attention and evoking bodily responses 
at and below the register of consciousness’. Having previously studied 
various forms and manifestations of productivist agriculture in rural 
Australia and alternatives in urban settings, I felt motivated to seek out a 
culture of food production in rural Australia other than productivism in 
large part to find some hope within a despairing time. In this sense I 
recognise the performativity of research in affecting the way we feel and 
think about the world around us (Law and Urry 2004; Gibson-Graham 
2008). Like Carolan (2016, 143) and other agri-food scholars who write 
on hoped for food futures (for example le Heron et al., 2016; Stock et al. 
2015; Sharpe 2020), I see something inherently hopeful in directing 
attention to the kinds of quotidian practices that, while small, might 
collectively give rise to different food futures. 
3.Methodology 
This research began with informal conversations with friends and 
colleagues who suggested there were lots of examples of farmers inter-
ested in agricultural practices that involved more than production. I 
followed up with internet searches using terms such as ‘regenerative 
agriculture Australia’ and ‘soil health Australia’ and read online reports 
about farmers engaging in such practices. I discovered two regions 
where there seemed to be a concentration of actors engaged in different 
agricultural practices – the Northern Tablelands in NSW (where I 
happen to live) and the Wet Tropics in north Queensland – and 
approached gatekeepers in each: Landcare and the organiser of a soil 
health workshop for farmers in the Northern Tablelands and an inde-
pendent not-for-profit environmental management group in the Wet 
Tropics. Gatekeepers in turn gave me the names of individual farmers in 
their region who they thought might be a suitable fit for the project. I 
invited 22 farmers by email to participate in the study. Over a period of 
five months in 2019 I spent time on 17 farms where I conducted semi- 
structured interviews and participated in farm walks/drives. Farms 
ranged in size from 15ha through to 1400ha and all were commercial 
family farm businesses (Table 1). 
4.Results 
4.1. Rethinking what counts: aiming lower, gratitude and a sense of 
‘enough’ 
One of the key factors argued to hold farmers in (productivist) place 
has been the focus on instrumental and financial goals of farming as key 
imperatives for defining the good farmer (Burton 2004; Sutherland and 
Darnhofer 2012). Historically yield was the key instrumental goal by 
which good farming was measured because it ‘measures only the hus-
bandry ability of the farmer and therefore represents a better indicator 
of the ‘good’ farmer than any economic measure’ such as return on in-
vestment or profit (Burton, 2004 p. 203). Unlike profit, which is a 
function of both on and off-farm factors – global price and demand for 
example – yield was argued to be a reliable indicator of good farming 
because it, along with its attendant symbols such as crop and animal 
health, reflected pure farmer action. In the preceding years as a finan -
cially viable farming business has become harder and harder to main -
tain, the symbols associated with yield have declined in value and, to 
some extent, been replaced by on-going commercial viability and N. Larder

151profitability (Sutherland and Darnhofer 2012) although yield remains 
an important measure of good farming in some contexts (Burton et al., 
2021). 
For farmers in this study, particularly cattle farmers living through 
drought, the instrumental measure of yield was expressly rejected as a 
measure of good farming. Financial success was important but only in-
sofar as it allowed farmers to get by and carry on farming. Alongside 
viability and profitability, good farming was also farming that supported 
a range of other values that reflect a notion of ‘surviving well’ (Gib-
son-Graham et al. 2016). For these farmers, the goal of farming stretched 
out across time and place to include more than production and 
encompass more than human well-being. What counted as good farming 
varied between farmers but included: healthy soil, the presence of 
worms, chemical-free solutions to weeds, having knowledge of ‘weeds’ 
as indicators of soil health rather than limiters of production or signs of 
an untidy farm, a ‘humming’ farm, production systems that leave the 
earth in better ecological health, freedom to experiment beyond current 
‘best practice’, farming that supports community, restoration of rain-
forests, lots of ‘timber’ or living trees, ‘untidy’ farms that leave fallen 
trees in place to rot and nourish soil life, livestock free farms during 
drought, and extensive ground cover during drought. These indicators of 
good farming challenge previous findings about what counts when it 
comes to the goals of farming which suggest that, even among 
non-conventional farmers such as organic producers, good farming re-
mains consistently tied to financial viability (cf. Sutherland and 
Darnhofer 2012). 
Cattle farmers living through drought in particular rejected yield as a 
measure of successful farming and instead aimed for lower production so 
those other critical life and production-sustaining ecological systems on 
the land – especially soil health and ground cover - wouldn’t be 
diminished beyond limits to carry on. For cattle farmers this meant 
destocking early in the drought. The process of de-stocking is one many 
livestock farmers in Australia would be familiar with. It is said to be 
risky for the farmer to destock because when rain comes, cattle prices 
will rise and profitability will decline with the higher cost of restocking. 
Some have argued the decision to keep or sell stock during a drought is based on individual circumstances made in the knowledge of how much 
‘feed’ or grass is left on the ground, tolerance for loss of ground cover, 
and willingness and ability to buy in feed in the form of hay to get by 
until rain falls again and grass grows (Bell 2018). Casting this decision as 
an individual one negates the symbolic importance among livestock 
farmers of having cows on the land. After all, in a productivist culture 
‘farmers want to farm’ (Burton 2004, p.196). For farmers in this study 
however, it was the absence of cows in the landscape rather than their 
presence that signalled good farming because it reflected a decision to 
prioritise ecological health over yield. 
The normalisation of feeding livestock through drought is closely 
tied to the good farmer ideal of maintaining yield: even in a situation 
where lack of rain leads to lack of grass and land can’t naturally support 
livestock, the land is expected to still support livestock. As Federal MP 
Barnaby Joyce reminded the Australian public in a video he uploaded to 
Twitter on Christmas Eve in 2019 deep into the drought: ‘well when it’s 
drought, you feed cattle’ (Joyce 2019). In the most recent east coast 
drought, this resulted in the trucking of hay across the country to allow 
farmers to hold on to animals at often significant financial expense, 
emotional pressure and ecological damage due to loss of ground cover 
and subsequent soil erosion.1 For farmers who have shifted their focus 
away from yield as a symbol of good farming, they were unequivocal 
that de-stocking reflected good farm management because it allowed 
them to stay within the ecological limits of the system. Paul’s explana -
tion (he is a sheep farmer in the New England) is an exemplar for this 
kind of thinking and I quote him at length here: 
There’s a lot of farmers out there that are running within their land 
capacity means and they’re matching their stocking rates to stocking 
capacity … your production might be going through the roof and 
you’ve got all the bragging rights, you’ve got the best genetics, 
you’re getting the top prices with all the sales … on the surface, 
externally that business looks like it’s doing really well. ABARES [the 
science and economies research division of the Australian Depart -
ment of Agriculture, Water and the Environment] looks at it and says 
‘they’re making big money’. Then there’s another property you drive 
past and it’s all over grown and the fences are falling down but the 
farmer’s happy and healthy. The ecosystem is thriving and they are 
making enough to pay rates. What’s right, what’s wrong?..There’s 
obviously a much lower stocking rate than most farmers would ever 
consider at the moment, but it is possible. And for those farmers that 
do match stocking rates to nature, even in drought they’ve still got 
ground cover, they’ve still got a healthy ecosystem around them and 
they’ll come out the other end without having gone into as much 
debt and doing as much damage to the ecosystem as a lot of other 
farmers are. 
The idea of reducing production to ‘just enough’ in order to stay 
within ecological limits was underpinned in many cases by a subtle but 
detectable expression of gratitude for what ‘just enough’ meant among 
some farmers I talked to. 
Contemporary Western philosophy takes a narrow view of gratitude 
arguing that it must always have a specific moral reason of merit or debt, 
that is, feelings of gratitude must have a deserving target (Fitzgerald 
1998). As McConnell (2013), a leading philosopher on gratitude, defines 
it: gratitude is ‘ … to designate an obligation or duty that an agent might 
have to another under certain conditions’. Instead of this narrow Table 1

1 The extensive east coast drought between 2016 and 2020 saw trucks driving 
livestock feed across the breadth of Australia. This practice was primarily 
constructed as charitable and necessary for struggling farmers who were victims 
of the long and difficult drought. The practice of buying in feed is rarely 
questioned in popular discourse with farmers assumed to have ‘no choice’. For 
farmers in this study there was always a choice to make between feeding and 
destocking and provides further evidence of the difference between a produc -
tivist culture of good farming and that of surviving well. N. Larder

152position on gratitude, Fitzgerald (1998, 137) argued a more expansive 
view of gratitude observed in non-Western thinking, particularly 
Buddhism: 
A moral agent ought to be concerned with all relevant moral reasons, 
not just whether gratitude is deserved, merited, or owed. If gratitude 
is not owed but can nonetheless cause great benefit or prevent great 
harm or repair communal ties, then the agent has a good moral 
reason to be grateful. The question of whether gratitude is owed is 
simply not the whole story. 
For Fitzgerald (1998, 146) then, gratitude is better defined as ‘(1) 
appreciation, (2) goodwill and (3) a disposition to act in a way that flows 
from this appreciate and goodwill’. I outline this distinction in the 
definition of gratitude because it is relevant for understanding the po-
sition among commercial farmers who were ‘aiming lower’ or expressed 
a sense of ‘enough’ and acted accordingly. This position stands clearly is 
opposition to productivist logics and contemporary notions of the good 
farmer and, is perhaps surprising given the dominant thinking that 
Australian are trapped between the positions of getting big or getting 
out. 
I observed gratitude (appreciation, goodwill and the disposition to 
act these feelings) in a number of ways as I conducted this research. For 
example, different farmers expressed: feelings of appreciation that they 
have enough, that is, a distinct lack of fear about scarcity even amidst 
drought; feelings of wanting to share what they had – knowledge, ex-
periences, time – with others; feelings of respect for the differences be-
tween farming approaches and a desire to embrace not defend against 
difference; and feelings of goodwill towards neighbours who were 
struggling through drought. This gratitude was not necessarily directed 
at anyone but it was there and it was beneficial for those who felt it 
because it allowed them to feel that, while what they had was not perfect 
and their production was not ‘through the roof’, it was enough to allow 
them to survive well. 
Moreover, even in times of drought which research suggests can be 
deeply impactful on farmers’ mental health (Edwards et al. 2015), 
farmers in this study expressed that there were things to feel grateful for. 
For example, deep in a four-year long drought Adam, a fourth genera -
tion farmer in the New England with 28 cows on his farm (he has run 
500 during good times), talked with an obvious sense of appreciation 
about his life when describing simple acts of farming practice to me: 
… I’m making my own fertilizer. Most of the ingredients we can find 
on the place … We’re just trying to be more self-sufficient and use 
what we’ve already got, rather than going out and having to spend 
thousands of dollars of inputs that will have a short term gain but not 
necessarily a long term gain. I’m just experimenting at the moment 
with a few different things. And during the drought, it’s given me 
something to be positive about … Just building and creating my own 
stuff instead of going out every day and feeding [livestock] which we 
know a lot of people are doing … Different things, building our own 
sprayer rig, putting compost together … It’s what gets me out of bed 
in the morning while there’s not much happening as far as grazing 
goes …. 
There was a sense of joy and contentment too in Adam’s voice as he 
talked about working on the farm with his wife: 
It’s funny, we had our wedding anniversary yesterday and we’re 
down in the paddock shovelling manure up. I said to her, ‘did you 
think nine years ago that this what you’d be doing?’ [Laughing]. She 
said ‘yea I thought we would be heading in this direction’. 
Farmers I talked with in the course of this research rebuff the idea 
that good farming was productivist farming and tied to instrumental 
goals of yield. They eschew a focus on yield and high profits and have 
reoriented the idea of the good farmer as one that survives well, often 
with ‘just enough’, within the ecological limits of the land. This shift is important because it upends the goal of the normative good farmer 
found in research to date away from extracting the maximum out of the 
land. Good farmers are also those who look to balance what the land can 
give under any certain circumstance and what the farmer or business 
needs to survive. 
4.2. Getting beyond human exceptionalism or coming to caring with 
While a commonly noted feature of productivist good farming is the 
clearing of native or other vegetation to enhance productive spaces (e.g. 
Bjørkhaug and Richards 2008), good farming as surviving well goes 
beyond human exceptionalism to recognise the role of myriad species in 
the act of production. Standing quietly with cattle farmer Katherine in 
front of a stand of around 50 mature Xanthorrhoea grass trees, there was 
a sense of awe about this feature of the landscape in which Katherine 
lived and raised cattle. Xanthorrhoea are slow growing trees that can 
live to 600 years old and are said to have been a staple plant for First 
Nations’ peoples providing food, drink, fibres and building materials 
(Atlas of Living Australia undated). As we wandered around these trees a 
different way of being seemed to settle over Katherine. She no longer 
seemed the competent land manager who could rattle off rates of grass 
growth per rainfall event and resultant sustainable stocking rates. 
Instead, like me, she seemed mesmerised by the trees: their sheer 
number, size and obvious longevity. I didn’t ask Katherine why she 
hadn’t cleared these trees to increase available pasture for her cows; 
such a question I suspect may have insulted her and disrespected the 
trees before us. But equally Katherine didn’t talk about needing to 
protect these trees. To offer protection or express a position of stew-
ardship over these trees would be to diminish the trees as living entities 
that had been here long before she arrived and would likely carry on 
here long after she departed. Katherine could have cleared these trees at 
any time to increase land for pasture of course. That she didn’t I offer, 
wasn’t out of a sense of stewardship reflecting her control over these 
trees, but because she was affected by them in a way that made the idea 
of clearing them unthinkable to her. Katherine, like other farmers 
engaged in this study, was, I venture, thinking beyond stewardship as 
control of the landscape and instead reflecting a sense of interdepen -
dence between humans and a range of non-human entities within the 
landscape, including the Xanthorrhoea. In relation to human-nature 
interdependence, Anna Tsing (2012, 144) suggests that: 
… human exceptionalism blinds us. Science has inherited stores 
about human mastery from the great monotheistic religions. These 
stories fuel assumptions about human autonomy, and they direct 
questions to the human control of nature, on the one hand, or human 
impact on nature on the other, rather than to species 
interdependence. 
The way that farmers frame their relationship with nature as one of 
mastery or interdependence matters, according to Roelvink (2018), 
because it shapes how farmers respond to their landscape and care about 
it. In her research with Australia farmers, Roelvink (2018) found that 
farmers who care about land as stewards care for the land by attempting 
to control other species and landscapes, while those who care with other 
species as collaborators learn from other species and seek to respond to 
the needs and liveliness of more-than-humans. This is not to say that 
stewardship-as-control over chaotic nature emerges independent of 
non-human nature; in fact as Gill (2014, 274) argued, ‘stewardship is 
better understood as an achievement that has … collective and indi-
vidual dimension. It is also not solely a human achievement – particular 
events such as rainfall or erosion events, animals and environmental 
processes are intertwined with variable social contexts and moralities.’ 
Even when recognised as an emergent achievement embedded in his-
tories of human and non-human agency, Australian farmers continue to

153ability of non-human beings and things to care with has been long un-
derstood within Australia’s First Peoples’ ontologies where Country can 
‘be talked to, it can be known, it can itself communicate, feel and take 
action (Bawaka Country et al., 2016). This is reciprocal care where care 
is ‘manifest in actions rather than consciously articulated’ (West et al., 
2018, 32). The more-than-human relational turn in recent years has 
helped Western thinkers to come to a deeper understanding of 
human-nature relations reflective of these ancient ontologies. Work on 
soils in particular has expanded thinking about the active role of soil and 
soil life in production systems and as caring with humans (Puig de la 
Bellacasa 2015; Krzywoszynska 2019). 
It would be an overreach to suggest farmers engaged in this study 
had adopted such ontologies, there is not enough evidence to suggest 
this. This is not to say that farmers are unaware of our dependence and 
interdependence with nature. Arguably most producers have long un-
derstood the act of production to be embedded in the environment and 
this in itself is reflective of an understanding of interdependence of some 
kind (e.g. see Tovey 1997). But I want to venture that farmers in this 
study recognised not only the ecological limits of the land but also that 
in the act and practice of caring for nature in the day-to-day of pro-
duction, nature can and does have an active role in contributing to the 
act of food production. This can be read as an extractivist view of nature 
as natural capital, that is, if we care for nature, it will provide better 
yield. But this does not minimise the value that such a belief brings to a 
renewed culture of farming that occurs in the wake of an understanding 
that nature is largely uncontrollable and in many ways complex beyond 
our understanding. In other words, there is evidence that farmers be-
liefs’ and farming practices’ fall on a spectrum of collaborations in 
caring with landscapes, soil, atmospheres, and the biota. Katherine 
Gibson (2020) suggests this is farmers ‘being-in-common’ with ecolog -
ical systems. Some farmers acknowledged weakly their interdependence 
with non-human natures but understood how deeply dependent we are 
on natural systems, such as the climate. For example, Julie, a native fruit 
producer in the Wet Tropics talked about the act of production as a 
mechanism to restore climate systems: 
‘ … really for me, the whole reason I did this [start growing native 
rainforest fruits] in the first place, was to restore rainforest and then I 
was like, well how do I get other people to put in rainforest? Well 
they clearly have to be making money before they’ll plant a rain-
forest … [But] that’s the reason my husband bought that block of 
land 30 years ago and why we started doing this 20 years ago … to 
combat climate change’. 
For others, particularly those who had become attuned to soil as 
lively, a sense of relational interdependence was more apparent. This 
was not necessarily in an obvious statement that reflected human 
exceptionalism but in gestures involving farming practices that explic -
itly engage in thinking about the contribution of complex ecological 
systems and process to the act of food production. There are numerous 
small stories I could tell here where I saw this in practice but I limit 
myself to two for brevity. 
Greg is a third generation tropical fruit farmer in the Wet Tropics and 
farms land his grandfather purchased in the 1920s. Over the years the 
land has produced a wide variety of commodities including tobacco, 
rice, paw paw and passionfruit. Greg currently commercially produces 
avocado and limes, selling into Sydney and Melbourne markets. As we 
sat surrounded by a thick haze of smoke from a near-by bushfire, Greg 
explained to me how his thinking has changed in recent years regarding 
the treatment of root rot in avocado, the most common avocado disease 
worldwide, caused by the Phythophthora cinnamomi pathogen (Weinert 
and Dickinson 2014). Best practice management for treating root rot is 
through injection of the chemical potassium phosphonate (Weinert and 
Dickinson 2014). The disease is spread through water and thus difficult 
to manage in the Wet Tropics, a region with high annual rainfall, so 
prevention is key to managing the problem. In recent years Greg has begun to experiment with holistic methods for preventing root rot in his 
avocadoes including heavy mulching to protect trees’ roots and applying 
microorganisms antagonistic to the P. cinnamomi to the soil. Greg 
laughed as he told me about the later practice: 
‘Yeah, you can go and buy a variety [of microorganisms], but the latest 
thing here is you’re better of going and collecting your indigenous mi-
croorganisms from something that’s more suited to this climate … Basi-
cally, you go and put a food source out in the bush somewhere, where you 
think might be the best spot and let them come in there and grow 
[laughing]. Then you come back after a month or something … and you 
capture them, and then try and breed them up and spread them under -
neath your trees (Greg, avocado farmer, Wet Tropics). 
There can be an argument that a productivist drive underlies Greg’s 
willingness to experiment with micro-biodiversity. We see a similar 
logic in much discussion in Australia around integrated pest manage -
ment for example, which values diversity but only for what it can do for 
productivity (e.g. Deutscher et al. 2005). But such a reading reflects a 
paranoid rather than generative stance to Greg’s intention here (see 
Sedgwick 1997 on paranoid reading). While farmers acknowledge the 
value of diversity for production systems, there is another element in 
how they talk about diversity that reflects something unknown and 
complex about the operation of the biological systems underpinning 
food production. As another farmer Adam articulated: 
I think that’s a part of what we’ve lost over the years with the in-
dustrial system – the chemicals and everything else have taken the 
insects and the spiders and the birds and all that stuff out of the 
systems. We need to try and bring them all back because they all help 
each other. I’m trying to think what they are called, the biota or 
something? It’s all that living system. It all interacts with each other 
and if any of that is out of balance, you start having problems with 
disease or in your crops of pasture die back or whatever … I know the 
universities have done lots of studies on what’s caused die back but I 
don’t think they’ve pinned it down. I think it’s all those things 
breaking down. Whether it’s too much fertilizer … So I think it’s all 
related. That’s another thing we’ve seen with the science side of 
things. It’s become very reductionist and they’re not looking at the 
whole which is frustrating … they’re looking at one thing in isolation 
and I think we need to look at it in a much bigger picture …. The 
more I do with this stuff the more I think we don’t know. There’s so 
much stuff that we don’t know. It’s almost overwhelming at times. 
It’s so big. How do you even start to manage it? 
Within the productivist model of good farming, there is often very 
little space for ecological care, care of others, or space to think about the 
active role nature plays in production. This is argued to be due to po-
litical economic imperatives that lock producers in to intensive systems 
of production or that farmers are unable to work themselves out from 
under the social pressure of being a ‘good’ farmer. But for farmers 
interviewed for this project, there was space not only for caring for 
nature but also evidence of an ontological shift – weak thought it was in 
some cases – that recognised the role of complex ecological systems as 
key actors engaged in food production alongside farmers. 
4.3. Collectively learning to ‘know’ more-than-production as farming 
In seeking to break out from a culture of contemporary good farming 
as productivism, producers in this study were required to rethink a 
whole range of self-referential and socio-cultural beliefs about what 
constitutes good farming. This has involved rethinking what counts as 
good farming and shifting ontological positions to decentre humans as 
the only beings engaged in the act of production. This rethinking has 
also involved coming to ‘know’ new practices that are outside existing 
cultural norms and incorporate such practices into an understanding of 
what farming is. For farmers in this project, just as the productivist good N. Larder

154farmer emerged in a community of practice as a ‘shared standard be-
tween all farmers in a locale’ (Burton et al., 2021, 132), so too the 
rethinking towards good farming as surviving well is a collective pursuit 
involving generating and sharing new lay knowledges. The ability of 
farmers to find a shared standard of good farming beyond productivism 
has been critical to the emergence of this form of good farming. 
There is a burgeoning undercurrent of alternative thinking and 
training opportunities for farmers in Australia who want to engage in 
more integrated farming practices (e.g. Ferguson and NRLHRG 2016) 
and these communities of practices have been important sites at which 
farmers come to know new ways of farming. Many of the livestock 
farmers I spoke with were informed to more or lesser degrees by training 
programs based on the work of Allan Savory, a Zimbabwean wildlife 
biologist, whose teachings are rolled out through two main training 
programs in Australia, Grazing for Profit run by RCS and Holistic Man-
agement, available through TAFE and private, certified holistic man-
agement educators. The Savory approach to livestock farming, which 
underpins regenerative (livestock-integrated) agriculture practices in 
Australia, holds rotational or cell grazing of livestock a critical feature 
(Gosnell et al. 2020; Sherren and Kent 2019). Rotational grazing, in 
contrast to set stocking, involves moving animals regularly between 
small ‘cells’ with the idea that land is ‘rested’ between grazing allowing 
it time to recover. Rotational or cell grazing is not a new phenomenon 
among Australia livestock farmers (see Richards and Lawrence 2009), 
but when combined with a triple-bottom line approach and a focus on 
soil and broader ecosystem health, represents a new approach to man-
aging agricultural landscapes (Gosnell et al. 2020) and a movement for 
regenerative agriculture is emerging globally (Duncan et al. 2021). 
Beyond regenerative livestock farming training, farmers talked about 
the importance of community-based workshops and events for sup-
porting new farming ‘know-how’. In the New England I sat in on a ‘soil 
biology field day’ run by a local farmer where farmers learned about 
vermiculture, building soil biology and how to use a microscope to study 
their soil. Farmers in the Wet Tropics talked about the value of a network 
associated with a community soil care group for exposing them to 
different ways of thinking and practicing farming. Greg, a tropical fruit 
farmer in the Wet Tropics told me: 
‘[We] … went down to Tully there the other day for a meeting. 
Meeting all these people who have gone a lot further than us, so 
we’re learning a lot off them. We’re learning what they’re willing to 
share … It’s valuable to see what’s going on. I mean, you’re stuck 
here in your little corner of the world and you don’t get out much, it’s 
really good to go out and see them. I happened to be sitting next to … 
a fruit farmer from down the coast. He’s right into trellising and some 
of these alternative methods. That was really good for me, just to be 
able to talk to him for an hour or two, pick his brains’ 
Farmer-to-farmer interactions like the one Greg describes above 
were important because they expanded the network in which farmers 
could engage in ‘roadside farming’ outside their immediate locale. 
Along with the legitimacy afforded it through scientific and institutional 
support, productivist good farming is partially ‘known’ and stabilised 
through a practice of ‘roadside farming’. Roadside farming involves 
farming making outward looking judgements of their peers but also 
involves a reflexive move to manage farming practice in light of these 
external judgements. It is a crucial mechanism for establishing social 
status among farmers and influencing management decisions on farm 
(Burton 2004). For farmers in this project, roadside farming was a 
common practice and it was a rare farmer that didn’t take me to a 
boundary fence to look over into a neighbouring farm and discuss the 
difference between here and there. Even for a non-farmer, the differ -
ences were often stark. The obvious differences across the fence – levels 
of ground cover, presence/absence of animals, tree cover – drove 
farmers in this study further away from productivist practices because 
what they saw over the fence – loss of ground cover, bare earth, animals being fed hay, few trees – reinforced their beliefs that their practices 
were moving them in the right direction. 
At the extra-local level, technology and the internet complicate how 
the good farmer is assembled and learns to know because farmers are no 
longer restricted to learning about what a good farmer is by comparing 
their practices to other farmers in their immediate locale (Burton et al., 
2021). Instead the community of practice has expanded to include the 
global community. For farmers in this study, the global community was 
often accessed through YouTube videos of other farmers sharing their 
practices – like Edward who told me ‘One of my sons put YouTube on the 
phone and I started listing to a few things and those YoutTubes could lead you 
to other people’s YoutTubes’. Traditional media were also important. For 
example, Adam, a cattle farmer talked about accessing information 
through international publications and how this was shifting his farming 
practice: 
Adam: ‘I’ve been reading the Stockman Grass Farmer magazine 
which comes out of the States and … It’s pretty much the only paper I 
read these days. It’s American based but every now and then there’s 
a bit of Australian stuff in there. It just opens you up to this whole 
new world … We’re just in the process of trying to change the style of 
cattle we’re using. So we’re going for a smaller frame cattle which 
will finish quicker and easier than the current status quo size of cattle 
in Australia. So this has come from … a guy by the name of Kit 
Farrow in the States who started basically growing smaller cattle for 
the grass fed industry … We’ve just bought some bulls through his 
genetics.’ 
For Adam, having access to international publications was important 
because local publications, such as the best known Australian agricul -
tural and rural farming paper, The Land, perpetuated old or traditional 
models of farming that didn’t fit with his conceptualisation of good 
farming, as he said when I asked him if he read The Land: ‘The Land? No 
not at all!..For the most part it’s the industrial model which I am definitely 
moving away from’. 
One of the key mechanisms that has allowed these farmers to shift 
their practices has been the diverse and extra-local social network in 
which they can locate themselves. These extra-local networks have been 
crucial in allowing farmers to come to know their practices as ‘farming’. 
These groups support farmers’ emergent unconventional practices and 
help farmers to make sense of values, objects and events that appear 
‘odd’ or inappropriate to neighbours and the local community. Such 
practices – destocking entirely to maintain groundcover, cultivating 
indigenous microorganisms, spraying biologicals on fields, refusing to 
feed animals with anything but grass – flow from a revaluing of what 
counts as farming. But these practice gain legitimacy, not by displacing 
productivism’s thick legitimacy in scientific and institutional policies 
and structures, but through collective learning that positions these 
particular practices of production as legitimate. Nevertheless, the local 
productivist gaze continues to do its work of making particular practices 
‘odd’ or illegitimate forms of farming. This is clear when Katherine – 
who is a relatively small cattle producer – says of herself ‘I’m certainly not 
what you would call a cattle producer’, by which she means she is not a 
productivist livestock farmer because the doesn’t prioritise yield. But for 
the most part, when these farmers look over the fence, the signs of the 
good, non-productivist farmer are no longer epistemically distant – they 
are there for them to see. 
5.Concluding thoughts 
There is no doubt political economic imperatives have driven 
Australian farmers to productivism. There is also no doubt productivist 
farming practices have wrought and continue to inflict damage to soils, 
waterways, and the atmosphere. It seems worthwhile then to tell actu-
ally existing stories about counter agri-cultures that manage to defy the 
productivist imperative and support multispecies flourishing. The N. Larder

155farmers I met and talked with in the course of this project were not the 
urban dwellers so often featured in stories of alternative agriculture in 
Australia, nor the stalwarts of Australian alterative agriculture, organic 
farmers, nor neo-peasant hobby farmers looking for a productive tree 
change. These were commercial farmers, many second, third and fourth 
generation, in regional Australia, who cut their farming teeth through 
the 70s, 80s or 90s when agriculture policy impelled so many to pro-
ductivism. Against the overwhelmingly dominant good farmer cultural 
norms that are argued to continue to hold productivism in place, these 
farmers are journeying towards a belief in and practice of good farming 
that recognising the value of different ways of farming. These farmers 
are increasingly attentive to the complexity of ecological systems, 
including soils, and recognise there is much we (the soil scientists, 
agronomists, farmers, and consumers) have to learn about what it means 
to practice good agriculture in this country. This culture of good farming 
does not mean production is displaced when environmental concerns 
enter the picture, but rather, such a culture recognises – to varying de-
grees to be sure – ‘the environment is internal to farming itself’ (Tovey 
1997, 24). This challenges the break between production and conser -
vation evident often in frontier cultures like Australia where agriculture 
has tended towards monofunctional landscapes, and land has been 
‘spared’ for conservation through its separation from systems of pro-
duction. Taking care for nature into production systems is less reflective 
of specialised productivism and more akin to multifunctional agriculture 
and agroecology models of farming found in mainland Europe and 
among small holder producers internationally (see for example 
Bjørkhaug and Richards (2008); Altieri (2009)). Such terms have his-
torically had little purchase in Australian vernacular where policy 
makers have largely rejected supporting integrated agriculture, arguing 
such supports are hidden subsidies that distorts markets and free trade 
agreements (e.g Wynen 2002). Adopting a more integrated view of what 
farming is has not required a radical shift in ontological position; these 
farmers are not, like the biodynamic farmers Pigott (2020) observed, 
sudden ‘believers’ in more-than-human agency and they largely reject 
spiritual views on producer-nature relations. But there is evidence of 
some power shift between farmer-nature. This is evident in farmers 
holding reverence for ecology’s complexity and more-than-knowable 
quality. This power shift looks like an unsettling of the controlling 
‘stewards of the land’ identity that has long been part of the ‘good 
farmer’ complex and an empowering of diverse nature - soil, bacteria, 
mycorrhizal fungi, worms, cows – who work alongside the farmer in 
complex ways to make nature edible. The unsettling of human excep -
tionalism around farm labouring identified here may reflect to some 
degree Indigenous ontologies of care as reciprocated by non-humans. 
More research is needed to determine how and to what extent notions 
of stewardship as anchored in control of nature are being untethered. 
Collectively though, through local networks and distant others accessed 
through technology, good farming as surviving well with not more than 
one needs and with respect to ecological limits is gaining its own thick 
legitimacy in rural Australia.
