Emotion ABSTRACT  
Increasing threats from pests and diseases fundamentally question what forest management is and must do in the 
21st century. The sociological concept of ‘care ’ offers new understandings of forest management as intimate and 
emotional relationships between people and trees. In this paper, we examine the empirical realities of conser -
vation forest management at a UK publicly owned site to reveal the social, economic, and institutional contexts of 
care and caring relations and their role in management decisions. 
This in-depth qualitative case study uses walking interviews with staff from all levels of the organisation and 
participatory data testing to show how care underpins the work of forest management, that forests are made and 
sustained through caring practices, and that management decisions are influenced by caring relations. Through 
the care framework we highlight the complexities of real-life decision-making and offer implications for forestry 
policy and practice. Applying the well-established components of care in a new setting, wherein the caring re-
lations involve nonhumans, we extend care theory and demonstrate the potential of the single case study for 
deeply contextual forest and conservation research.   
1.Vignette 
Greenshire Forest is managed for conservation and recreation. John 
has worked here for twenty years, managing the veteran trees and 
working tirelessly to promote their value. John is a member of a pro-
fessional organisation, corresponding with colleagues at other forests to 
develop his intimate knowledge of these trees. In his leisure time, John 
records woodland fungi with a local group, something he has done for 
many years. Like other forest managers he knows, John is very con-
cerned by the decline in forest ecosystems and is looking at increasing 
income while preserving the forest for future human and nonhuman 
benefit. 
2.Introduction 
The urgency for new ways of understanding forest management 
stems from a range of threats, including the spread of pests and patho -
gens beyond their natural ranges (Brasier, 2008 ). Lawrence (2017 : 51) 
has characterised this as “a coming time of extreme uncertainty and instability ” and, in the UK, increased interest in tree health, particularly 
oak and ash, has led to changes in government policy and advice on 
forest management. However, policies and advice tend to be instru -
mental and rational, with the relational nature of forest management 
and the emotional influences unacknowledged at the core of decision- -
making (Buijs and Lawrence, 2013 ). Left unacknowledged, the risk is 
that decisions are made that do not align with people ’s relational un-
derstanding of and emotional investment in forest management. Such a 
misalignment undermines people ’s ability to care for and about forests. 
With the rise in actual and potential threats from pests and diseases 
among other demands, difficult decisions need to be made around how 
to care for trees. The current challenges fundamentally question what 
constitutes forest management and how to make space for the emotional 
resources required. Multiple definitions of forests have emerged since 
the 1960s, broadening understandings of forest management from tim-
ber production alone to include ecological conservation, climate miti-
gation, and stewardship of ecosystems (Chazdon et al., 2016 ). In this 
paper we view forests as “complex systems composed of heterogeneous 
assemblages of individual agents (e.g. trees, animals, humans) ” (Messier

227et al., 2015) and use the term ‘nonhuman’ to embrace all the species 
which, together with humans, make up the forest ecosystem (Herman, 
2015). 
Central to the processes of stewardship, underpinning sustainable 
forest management (UNFAO, 2018), are practices of strategy, planning, 
and intervention. Forest management teams, wherever they work, 
whatever the objectives, care for and about trees. In this paper, we 
define care as the paid and unpaid provision of support involving action 
and feelings (Thomas, 1993), and explore the empirical realities of 
management of a conservation forest (as experienced by people like 
John in our vignette) by using Thomas’s care framework, to reveal the 
actual and potential significance of care and caring relations between 
people and trees. 
In sustainability science, care is increasingly identified as a moti-
vating force in differentiating notions of stewardship from conventional 
approaches to management and governance (West et al., 2020). New 
frameworks are proposed to connect multiple meanings of stewardship 
centred around care, knowledge, and agency (Enqvist et al., 2018) and 
to complement existing instrumental approaches to support justification 
for action, boost motivation, and broaden the spectrum of conservation 
practices (Jax et al., 2018). West et al. (2020) acknowledge care as “an 
embodied, collective and reciprocal practice involving humans and 
nonhumans”. 
The idea of forest management as care or as being made-up of care- 
taking tasks is rarely openly acknowledged or discussed in the sector: 
“Forestry, as a project of high rationalism, is particularly susceptible to 
the separation of emotion and management” (Buijs and Lawrence, 
2013:109). Recent social science studies reveal an emphasis on attitudes 
as the main determinant of forest management behaviour, creating ty-
pologies of forest owner types, values, and objectives to understand and 
predict responses to policy instruments (Eriksson, 2012; Sauter, 2018; 
Blanco, 2015, among others). However, Ficko et al.’s (2019) review of 
private forest owner typologies questions their usefulness, stating: “In 
order to be realistic and useful in practice, typologies should be linked 
directly with forest owners’ overt behaviour”. They also find that ty-
pologies represent a snapshot in time when policy contexts are dynamic. 
What is missing from these studies is an acknowledgement of relational 
and emotional influences. The realities of forest management 
decision-making are dynamic, context specific, and exceed economic 
models and psychological frameworks. As de la Bellacasa (2011:198) 
suggests, care is “concomitant to life”, present even when ignored or 
denied (Lawson, 2007). The care framework helps to uncover relational 
and emotional influences in decision-making within their wider eco-
nomic, social and institutional settings, while recognising the dynamic 
nature of care over time. Its aim is not to predict behaviour, but rather to 
gain a deeper contextual understanding of care, allowing us to create 
space for the emotional resources required in managing forests. 
In this paper we draw on an in-depth qualitative case study of forest 
management for conservation at a single UK site, a large conservation 
forest with hundreds of thousands of trees that we call Greenshire Forest. 
We investigated encounters between the management team and the 
forest, and how the team cares for trees. We discuss the social science 
literature on care and recent work on forest management, before moving 
to our methodological approach and introducing our case study. We 
then explore forest management at our conservation case study site 
using the care framework developed by Thomas (1993). We end with a 
discussion of the key insights emerging from forest management as care, 
the potentialities of this more care-full approach to forest management, 
and some avenues for future research. We encourage people to explore 
their own caring relations with trees and nonhumans as they engage 
with this paper. 
3.Care and forest management 
In the social science literature, care is regularly discussed in terms of 
caring for and about someone through caring work and feelings (Thomas, 1993). Studies have explored care as paid labour, as relations 
between family members, and as unpaid domestic activity (Milligan, 
2000). Yet, the natural environment and those who care for it have also 
been affected by cuts to public spending (MacKechnie et al., 2011) and 
the notion of care is increasingly being applied to inter-species re-
lationships. In this section, we introduce social science ideas about care 
and then discuss how existing literature on forest management might 
make space for care. 
3.1. What is care? 
Care was first examined and conceptualised in the 1980s in the 
feminist literature (Graham, 1991; Thomas, 1993; Ungerson 1990; Finch 
and Groves, 1983; Tronto 1994), with scholars seeking to challenge both 
the prevailing gender ideologies and the types of research being un-
dertaken, wherein questions of economic productivity were favoured 
over people’s lived experience. At this time, care, even as waged work, 
was likely to be overlooked being generally outside the market. A key 
factor here was the gendered nature of care work, undertaken in do-
mestic spaces, often with marginalised groups, such as the young or sick 
(Bowlby 2012; Daly and Lewis, 1998; Finch and Groves, 1983). Through 
a focus on care, feminist scholars explored important questions related 
to gender inequality and relations between capitalism and gendered 
power roles. Furthermore, these studies moved away from ‘rational’ 
models towards qualitative methodologies that examined the realities of 
people’s lives. 
To consolidate some of the ways in which care had been discussed, 
Thomas (1993:665) identified seven dimensions common to all concepts 
of care (see Table 1), thereby offering a more cohesive definition. These 
seven dimensions are the: social identity of the care-giver; social identity 
of the care-recipient; inter-personal relationships between care-giver 
and care-recipient; nature of care; social domain within which the car-
ing relationship is located; economic character of the care relationship, 
and the institutional setting in which care is delivered. Importantly, 
Thomas’ framework recognises the social, economic, and institutional 
settings of care. 
Since then, social scientists have considered: care of someone or 
Table 1 
The seven dimensions common to all concepts of care (based on Thomas, 1993).  
Dimensions Description 
Care-giver and care-recipient 
1. Social identity of the care-giver Social characteristics defining care-givers: (1) 
gender; (2) familial or occupational roles. 
2. Social identity of the care- 
recipient Social characteristics defining those in receipt 
of care: (1) group membership, e.g. age; (2) 
dependency status, e.g. policy-defined 
dependency, such as the elderly. 
The nature of caring relations 
3.Inter-personal relationships 
between care-giver and care- 
recipient The nature of the relationship defined in 
terms of bonds signifying degrees of personal 
familiarity and obligation: ranging from 
family/friendship to between strangers (e.g. 
statutory). 
4. Nature of care The primary social content of caring, either: 
(1) feeling state (emotion, affection) – ‘caring 
about someone’; or (2) activity state (work, 
labour) – ‘caring for someone’. Can be both 
feeling and activity. 
Caring context 
5. Social domain within which the 
caring relationship is located The social division of labour in capitalist 
society between the public (formal care - 
paid/voluntary) and domestic (informal 
care). 
6. Economic character of the care 
relationship The waged and unwaged status of caring 
work, governed by normative obligation or 
monetary transactions. 
7. Institutional setting in which care 
is delivered Physical location of caring activities e.g. 
home or institutional/organisational setting.  T. O’Flynn et al.

228something by taking an interest in its wellbeing; care for by doing things; 
and care about someone or something that is rooted in deep emotion 
(Bowlby 2012 ). By considering care as “the provision of practical or 
emotional support ” (Milligan and Wiles, 2010 ), empirical studies have 
emerged in settings as diverse as friendship groups (Bowlby 2012 ) and 
bioscience laboratories (Kerr and Garforth, 2016 ). Types of care-givers 
include the public sector, the market, the family, and the not-for-profit 
sector (Razavi, 2007 ), while the time required for care work is limited 
by the capacity and capabilities of the care-recipient (Mad orin, 2013; 
cited in Wichterich, 2015 :87). 
After Thomas, scholars have continued to develop a more expansive 
notion of care, including but not limited to studies around: ‘bounded ’ 
and ‘unbounded ’ care (Atkinson et al., 2011 ), wherein degrees of 
proximity are linked to emotional attachment between care-giver and 
care-recipient; ‘caringscapes ’ by Popke (2006) that draws attention to 
the spatial and temporal aspects of care, and its makeup of associations 
(Greenhough, 2011 ); ‘care ethics ’ (Tronto, 1994 ; Cloke, 2002 ), a focus 
on understanding “who has access to care and who does care work ” 
(Lawson, 2007 ); and the moralities of care, acknowledging that care is 
not always positive (Tronto, 1994 ), for example when creating de-
pendency (Conradson, 2003 ). Critiques of care scholarship have tended 
to focus on the absence of analysis of racial and class dimensions and 
unacknowledged, but assumed, roles for women as care-givers and 
children as care-recipients (Razavi, 2007 ). 
Care is an important means of understanding how people relate to 
the world around them, and the relationship between people and trees is 
no exception (as our vignette indicates): 
“Care work is understood to be tasks, interactions, labour processes 
and occupations involving care of others, physically, psycholog -
ically, and emotionally. Care work can be proactive or reactive, 
formal or informal, and when done by people, it may be paid or 
unpaid ” (Coulter, 2016 :199 –200). 
Care between humans and nonhumans is an embodied experience, 
emerging as touch and response-ability (Haraway, 2008 ; de la Bellacasa, 
2015 ; Schuurman and Franklin, 2018 ) and can include nonhumans as 
care-givers and humans as care-recipients. Since the early 1990s, some 
scholars have sought to challenge and dismantle forms of dualistic 
thinking that enforce binary distinctions between the 
feminine-masculine, nature-society, subjective-objective, and 
irrational-rational. Giving way to care of, for, and about other species 
(Whatmore, 2006 ), an influential study in this area has been Haraway ’s 
work When Species Meet (2008) which describes her relationship of care 
and companionship with her dog. For Haraway, responding physically 
and emotionally to her dog is fundamental to caring relations, devel -
oping a sense of ‘response-ability ’, namely commitment and obligation. 
In the case of plants, their cultural significance, agency, and the ways in 
which they are managed (Jones and Cloke, 2002 ; Head and Atchison, 
2009 ), such as invasive plant management (Atchison and Head 2013 ), 
has attracted attention. What space is there for understandings of care 
and caring relations in existing social science work in and around forest 
management? 
3.2. Potential contributions of care to the forest management literature 
We identify three opportunities to make space for discussions of care 
and caring relations in forest management. First, recent thinking from 
human geography and allied disciplines allows us to say more about the 
relations between people and trees. Brace and Geoghegan (2011 , p. 296) 
call for greater sensitivity to questions of scale, both spatial and tem-
poral, to make connections between familiar landscapes, the lifecycles of 
geology, plants, and animals, and human action. Other studies include 
responding to nonhuman ways of being for forest biodiversity (Peltola 
and Tuomisaari, 2015 ), forest farms as entanglements of humans and 
nonhumans (Herman, 2016 ), embodied and affective encounters with trees (Pearce et al., 2015 ), and the roles and motivations of those 
working with trees (Peltola and Tuomisaari, 2016 ). Such theoretically 
informed approaches create spaces to think differently about forests as 
entanglements of people, trees, and other species. A second opportunity 
is in emerging work on emotions in forest management, whereby private 
owners of inherited forests often make decisions on emotional, rather 
than economic, grounds to honour past generations and protect their 
own legacy (Lahdesm aki and Matilainen (2014). Such emotions are 
reinforced within the owners ’ social networks, further influencing 
management practices (Vainio et al., 2018 ). Forest management con-
flicts are shown to involve emotional dimensions that are regularly 
unacknowledged, resulting in issues around problem definition and 
decision-making (Kennedy and Vining, 2007 ) and compounded by 
workplace cultures that emphasise ‘rational ’ processes and suppress 
emotional responses (Vining and Tyler, 1999 ). Focussing largely on local 
communities, Buijs and Lawrence (2013) identify the productive po-
tential of people ’s emotional attachments to trees for joint action, 
although many forest managers may be ill-equipped to mobilise them. 
Further work exploring the emotional dimensions of forest management 
calls for more detailed empirical studies of forest management as lived 
experience. 
The third opportunity stems from recent work on tree health issues, 
based largely on qualitative methods, that has sought to explore and 
understand forest managers ’ knowledge (Marzano et al., 2015 , 2016 ), 
how this is used to frame tree health issues (Marzano et al., 2017 ), and 
what forest managers are doing in response (Lawrence, 2017 ), as well as 
to highlight the agency and resilience of trees in forest management 
(Dandy et al., 2018 ; Dyke et al., 2018 ). Such work exposes the complex 
relations between people and trees and the transformation of long-
standing management practices in light of increased threats to trees. 
Caring relations have the potential to reveal critical information about 
the challenges associated with forest decisions, particularly when there 
are competing interests based upon the legacies, actions, and hopes of 
past, present, and future generations. 
In what follows we use Thomas ’s care dimensions to explore the 
relational and emotional facets of forest management and human- 
nonhuman relations in a conservation forest. In the next section we 
introduce our case study and outline our methodology. 
4.Methodology and case study 
There are relatively few situated accounts of forest management. 
Earlier qualitative studies have tended to focus on specific forest man-
agement roles or forest types, with data collected across several sites, 
affording only a narrow perspective on the professional and personal 
influences at play. In our research, we adopted a single case study that 
allowed for a fuller examination of the social, economic, and institu -
tional contexts that might affect decision-making. In the methodological 
literature, there has been considerable discussion of case study ap-
proaches. Yin (2014 , p. 21) argues that single case studies may lead to 
important insights that may be “generalisable to theoretical propositions 
and not to populations or universes ”. Our decision to focus on one 
conservation forest means we have been able to explore the 
well-established components of care in a new setting and involving 
nonhuman species, while providing empirical data on everyday 
decision-making; we do not claim transferability of our analysis to other 
locations. 
4.1. Greenshire Forest 
Greenshire Forest covers several hundred hectares, comprising 
mainly broad-leaved deciduous woodland, with many ancient pollards, 
along with open grassland and water bodies. Parts of the forest are le-
gally protected for conservation purposes. Historically, the forest was 
used for hunting, timber, and livestock grazing and in the nineteenth 
century there was a sustained campaign to save the forest. Now T. O’Flynn et al.

229managed by a public authority, senior management is based at its urban 
headquarters several miles away. The authority ’s forest management 
objectives are environmental and social and the forest-based team de-
velops the management plans and deals with operational issues. Current 
pressures such as climate change, air pollution, encroaching develop -
ment, increasing visitor numbers, tree health risks, and financial con-
straints present a complex set of challenges for the management team. 
4.2. Data collection 
An important element of our single case study approach was deep 
researcher engagement with the forest ’s management processes over 
twelve months. This involved attendance at meetings, at the authority ’s 
headquarters and in the forest, of forest managers with internal and 
external stakeholders, and documentary review. Stakeholders included 
regulatory and funding bodies, local groups, and professional organi -
sations. Diverse documents were reviewed, including management re-
ports; regional, local, and site-specific policies, plans and applications; 
academic studies; historical accounts; media; volunteers ’ newsletters 
and websites. This engagement provided important background infor-
mation that fed into the interview design and analysis. 
Data collection for this paper comprised of semi-structured in-
terviews (Bryman 2012 , p, 471) allowing for free-flowing responses. 
Most of the interview was spent outdoors, walking in and interacting 
with the forest, following a route chosen by the participant. The inter-
view questions covered organisational and practical matters and, on a 
more personal level, questions about professional and personal moti-
vations; what the forest meant to them; how they felt about the forest ’s 
future; their favourite place in the forest, and anything else they wanted 
to share. 
Following a pilot interview at another site, interviews were carried 
out in 2017 –18. The care literature acknowledges that care-givers are 
usually women, yet in forest management the reverse is the norm. We 
had 14 participants, including four women, ten individual interviews 
and one group of four. Interviews lasted up to 2 hours, with the same 
interviewer. We purposively selected participants from all levels and 
locations of the organisation, from elected politicians at the urban 
headquarters to arborists in the forest. Local volunteers and community 
representatives were also interviewed. Not all the participants worked 
directly with trees, those who did had job titles such as ‘conservation 
arborist ’ or ‘ecologist ’. Those who were office-based, were engaged in 
what we call forest matters, such as strategic planning, land manage -
ment, and the organisation of work (see Fig. 1). In common with other 
forestry studies (Lawrence, 2017 , among others), we have not identified 
the forest or individual roles to ensure participant anonymity. 
4.3. Data analysis 
The interviews were recorded, transcribed professionally, and then 
shared with the participants for their comments, a form of participant 
validation for credibility (Barbour, 2001 ). Each transcript was coded, 
manually and using NVivo software, using an open coding scheme based 
on the interview guide. Further codes and sub-codes were added as new topics emerged from the data (Bryman 2012 , p. 568). 
The coding was carried out by one person and issues of reliability 
were addressed by refining the codes following the pilot interview and 
intra-coder reliability tests (Joshi et al., 2011 ). The codes were then 
analysed thematically by grouping the codes into themes around which 
the empirical findings were structured. To further mitigate coding bias, 
“investigator triangulation ” (Denzin, 1970; cited in Archibald, 2015 ) 
with three other project social scientists was carried out. The group then 
considered the theoretical implications alongside processes of manage -
ment emerging from field notes and documents. 
Through the analysis two stronger than anticipated themes emerged. 
Firstly, that responding to pests and diseases was inseparable from wider 
forest management, and, secondly, that participants were deeply 
attached to Greenshire Forest and concerned for its future, adopting a 
range of professional and personal strategies in response. This paper 
presents the analysis of the emotional attachment aspect of the data 
within the broader forest management context using Thomas ’ seven 
dimensions of care. 
4.4. Data testing with participants 
The small number of participants led us to question how represen -
tative these findings might be of other forest managers. Silverman 
(2000) defines validity as the “extent to which an account accurately 
represents the social phenomena to which it refers ” and we decided to 
test our analysis by holding a “Data Party ” (Franz, 2018 ), a novel 
participatory workshop, in September 2018. Participants comprised 
seven of those interviewed at Greenshire Forest, eight managers/owners 
from other public and private forests of different sizes and management 
objectives, and four specialist forestry advisers. Participants were asked 
how the dimensions of care related to their own experience, specific 
aspects of the findings, and whether anything was missing. Participants 
strongly identified with care as a useful way to think about forest 
management as it surfaced managers ’ emotional attachments. There 
were no substantive differences between participants from conservation 
and commercial or public and private forests, suggesting forest man-
agers, wherever they work and whatever the objectives, care for and 
about trees. 
5.Forest management as care 
In this section, we present the results of our analysis of the interview 
data following Thomas ’s (1993) seven dimensions of care. When 
selecting quotes, we chose those that were illustrative of the care di-
mensions and, where relevant, represented different views. 
5.1. Defining the care-giver and care-recipient 
5.1.1. The social identity of the care-giver 
The balance of decision-making powers between the authority and 
the forest-based team suggested that the definition of a care-giver in this 
case study included not only individual humans but also institutions, in 
line with the analysis of Razavi (2007) . The owner of the forest, the

O’Flynn et al.

230public authority, depicted its role as protector of the environment and 
facilitator of public culture and wellbeing. The forest-based team made 
recommendations for local policies and certain operational actions, e.g. 
removal of Rhododendron, in official reports, for the authority’s 
approval. 
The key social characteristic defining individual care-givers in 
Greenshire Forest arose from their occupational and leisure-based roles. 
Participants’ descriptions of occupational roles included arborists, 
ecologists, and land managers. Leisure-based care involved deep 
engagement with nature leading to expertise which was drawn upon in 
the professional role. Leisure roles included bird watcher, licensed bat 
handler, bushcraft instructor, and hedge-layer, sometimes in parallel 
with occupational roles. In some cases, leisure-based caring inspired 
career paths: 
“the original motivation to become a tree surgeon was a love of trees 
and a love of outdoors and a love of expressing myself physically 
through bodily movements, climbing three-dimensionally through a 
living object is something really quite special, which not a lot of 
people get to experience” (IP11). 
More than one participant mentioned that their leisure interests led 
them to apply for jobs in the Forest, suggesting a blurring of roles and 
potential amplification of vocational commitment. 
“I did a five year study on bats in [named part of the forest] … I was 
looking at how our management work affected the … foraging 
behaviour of local bat species” (IP10). 
5.1.2. The social identity of the care-recipient 
In Greenshire Forest the main care-recipient were the nonhumans. 
However not all care-recipients were cared for equally. Due to economic 
constraints, care-givers were unable to care for the whole forest as they 
would like: 
“It’s quite tough … on a lot of those areas where they’re not being 
managed today and remaining dark, things are falling over … we’ve 
got lots of ancient trees, we’re going to lose them” (IP9). 
Forced to choose who or what was afforded care, care-recipients 
were framed based on rational as well as personal preferences across 
the different institutional levels. Criteria included conservation impor -
tance, socio-cultural identity, and health and safety as well as socially 
constructed hierarchies. This resulted in framings of nonhumans into 
binary groupings, including healthy and unhealthy specimens, native 
and non-native species, young and old, and rare and common species. In 
the forest some young trees were removed to give space for ancient trees 
and relating to pests, one participant used the native and non-native 
binary to comment on the removal of rhododendron to stop the spread 
of Phytophthora ramorum: 
“reducing the potential damage to the forest as a whole by removing 
something that … isn’t native anyway, and has got something on it 
that could spread, then it’s a bit of no-brainer really” (IP1). 
Forest managers recognised the different spatialities of care- 
recipients for example by framing individual trees as habitats and 
using this to influence their decision-making. 
“… protection of an oak tree is really protecting that oak forest 
habitat and all the other species that are then associated with that 
habitat” (IP3). 
Beyond accepted rational criteria, forest management decisions were 
influenced by the personal preferences of those working at all levels of 
the institution. Higher management afforded a level of discretion at the 
ground level and proposals for specific tree management, which were 
partly based on personal preferences, were put forward and supported 
by higher management. Participants expressed preferences for certain bird species “I would love to hope that some of the bird species like 
nightingales, that we could actually get them back and by our habitat 
management” (IP9), and tree species: “I do love oaks as an individual 
species … it’s the iconic English oak” (IP1). Others indicated their 
appreciation for trees with historical significance: “You can’t help being 
influenced by the trees and some of the trees have individual names and 
histories” (IP8). 
5.2. The nature of caring relations between people and trees 
5.2.1. The interpersonal relationship between the care-giver and care- 
recipient 
The interpersonal nature of the relationship between care-giver and 
care-recipient is defined in terms of “ties or bonds signifying degrees of 
personal familiarity and obligation” (Thomas, 1993:652). In the Forest 
participants drew on their occupational and leisure activities, describing 
bonds at both the individual and institutional level. 
Personal and institutional familiarity were framed by participants in 
two ways: (1) the distance between the care-giver and the forest; and (2) 
the length of time spent in a caring role. In terms of distance, some 
participants lived locally to the forest, while others worked at the 
authority’s urban headquarters. Participants discussed the implications 
of distance for the care of the forest: “most of the members of the [au-
thority] don’t live anywhere near here and don’t have any knowledge of 
the Forest” (IP2). The perception that proximity positively affected 
decision-making was challenged by the understanding shown by 
headquarters-based participants. As for time spent in a caring role and 
the resulting deeply held knowledge about the Forest, a high degree of 
personal familiarity with Greenshire Forest was built over decades, in 
some cases from childhood: “As a child I was walking in it, playing in it 
… from the age of 11, 12, I was natural historicising” (IP2) 
“[Greenshire] Forest was one of the main reasons for getting on to 
the [authority], just because I was born [nearby], grown up there my 
entire life” (IP1) 
Extended occupational caring in one forest was particularly valued, 
with one professional with 10 years’ experience described as a “newbie” 
(IP6) by his peers. Participants expressed concern at the loss of in-depth 
site knowledge as long term care-givers moved jobs or retired. The types 
of knowledge that indicated familiarity were technical, ecological, and/ 
or scientific, gained through work and leisure activities or formal edu-
cation. For the authority also, its decades-long role in preserving the 
forest produced historical knowledge which highlighted changes to the 
forest ecosystem: “when you’re looking at biological records for, even 
like just 30, 50 years old, you just want to cry … it’s all gone” (IP10). 
The bonds of obligation were discussed in terms of both personal and 
institutional commitment to the forest. Beyond occupational roles, 
participants described how they spent their leisure time in caring ac-
tivities, such as giving public talks and being involved in local groups. 
For one, a sense of responsibility reinforced their loyalty to the Forest: 
“The ancient trees are amazing; you gradually get into the ‘I can’t leave 
these to somebody else’” (IP9). Others showed commitment by 
extending their place-based relationship with the Forest forward to the 
next generation and others: “my kids love that particular tree … if I have 
friends who don’t know the Forest well, that’s the sort of place I’ll take 
them to” (IP8). Personal commitment also extended to the past with 
some describing how they returned to sites where they had worked 
previously to view progress: “to see what you did 20, 30 years ago and 
how it’s looking now. It reassures you that you’re doing broadly the 
right sort of things” (IP3). 
The authority’s bonds of obligation arose from two sources, firstly 
legal requirements relating to health and safety, pests and diseases, and 
the site’s designations for nature conservation. Meeting the requirement 
to maintain the site in a favourable condition involved a broad caring 
approach: “all those individual components, particularly the veteran T. O’Flynn et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Journal of Rural Studies 86 (2021) 226–235
231trees, have to remain healthy” (IP8). Secondly, caring commitments 
beyond minimum legal requirements were evident, such as the provision 
of “social goods and public service” (IP8), with the authority’s historical 
role in preserving the forest mentioned: “you do feel you have the hand 
of history on your shoulder in this job” (IP8). Despite the distance of the 
authority’s headquarters from the Forest, its longstanding connection to 
the forest underpinned its statutory and voluntary obligations to protect 
the forest and secure its future: “we’ll be handing it on in as good a 
condition or better than it has been in for the last 50 years” (IP3). 
The analysis suggests that distance to the care-recipient did not affect 
institutional familiarity significantly, perhaps due to the regular formal 
and informal discussions between the headquarters and forest teams, 
and that bonds of obligation manifested in the authority’s strategies and 
policies, as well as individual personal commitment. 
The participants also talked about the benefits the forest provided to 
humans, such as biodiversity, water, and cultural services. This fits with 
recent attempts to include a reciprocal dimension in reframing 
ecosystem services as Nature’s contributions to people (NCPs) (Diaz 
et al., 2018). 
5.2.2. The nature of care 
Caring is described by Thomas (1993) as either feeling and activity 
together or activity alone, while sociological studies suggest caring 
about something can motivate caring actions (Katila, 2002). In this 
section, we consider the nature of care in forest management as both 
feeling and activity. 
5.2.2.1. Caring feelings. The participants, wherever they were based, 
described positive and negative emotions associated with their caring 
relations, including affection and even love: “I live and breathe the 
forest” (IP2); “we all have a passion for nature and so that’s always going 
to reflect on our interest in what we do” (IP6). These intense feelings 
supported participants’ bonds of obligation: “we would certainly not 
want to lose our forest and I think that whatever it took to preserve it … 
we would accept that and work to maintain it” (IP14). 
Participants also described positive feelings for trees they had 
worked on, parts with childhood or family connections, areas with 
specific natural characteristics, features of historical significance, and 
places of quiet and beauty. Negative emotions also featured as partici -
pants described feelings of grief over ecosystem losses: “A skylark was 
singing there last year … Suddenly, the sense of place … it’s had its heart 
ripped out.” (IP9). When asked to imagine the future of the forest, 
participants were uneasy about the long-term implications of their forest 
management decisions: “But who knows really? Are we just dabbling? In 
100 years’ time they’re going ‘What the hell were they doing that for?’” 
(IP10). 
Participants also expressed frustration at damage caused by human 
and nonhuman visitors to the Forest and wanted to limit public access as 
a result: 
“God, look at the litter exposed by our cutting. That’s a real bugbear, 
god, if we could just change people’s attitude … it’s probably quite a 
large number of people that don’t care” (IP9). 
“Dogs, I oppose dogs … People are letting their dogs bite into trees 
and it’s, the other issues around dogs as well. Faeces, urination, and 
stuff” (IP4). 
Participants’ feelings about the forest were suffused with personal 
meanings and, while public opinion about the forest was a management 
consideration, the occupational and personal attachments of those 
involved in forest management may unknowingly have influenced the 
authority’s decision-making (as suggested by Vining and Tyler, 1999). 
Yet, caring feelings motivated caring activities. 
5.2.2.2. Caring activities. The participants made clear that forest man-
agement involved much more than looking after trees, with planned and reactive work relating to administration, car parks, contractors, live-
stock, and education activities mentioned. Administrative tasks involved 
staff supervision, internal and external communication, strategy writing, 
applying for grants, regulatory compliance, and policy-making. The 
balance of administrative and practical tasks varied between roles and 
increasingly used technology: “I don’t have much contact with nature 
now really, I have a lot of contact with budget sheets, disciplinary, HR 
issues, strategic planning” (IP 8). If time available for hands-on caring 
was reduced for some participants, then the extended timescales of trees 
meant that care activities also extended temporally: “A 100-year tree 
strategy … Everything is looking way beyond our lifespans, it’s long 
long-term vision” (IP3). Yet, not all care decisions resulted in action; 
‘doing nothing’, for example allowing natural regeneration of trees or 
leaving deadwood in place, was sometimes thought to be the best 
approach. 
Those who were regularly in contact with trees described a range of 
practical caring tasks such as pollarding and spraying pesticides. These 
tree work practices revealed the embodied nature of care in forest 
management: 
“[one] thing that’s really interesting is creating new pollards … you 
look at a relatively young tree, maybe only a 40, 50 year-old tree, and 
you take the top out of it and see if you can get it to sprout and 
produce the new stems” (IP3) 
“When you start climbing one of these big, old trees, on the way up 
you begin to understand how it moves and how it feels underneath 
you and how it responds to your weight. It’s very tactile” (IP11). 
Participants were also involved in occupational and leisure-based 
research-type activities in the forest, such as monitoring, counting, 
identifying, and recording to inform management policies. Notwith -
standing this, not all care activities were regarded as beneficial: “they 
have produced a number of management plans of the forest - all of which 
I’ve spoken out quite strongly against but being a minority didn’t make a 
lot of progress” (IP2). 
The authority’s caring approach was set out in its management plans 
yet care-givers were also known to disagree on the best form of care 
based on their professional perspectives. One participant highlighted the 
difference between silviculture and arboriculture: “[in silviculture] you 
are encouraging oak trees through a thinning programme and … you’re 
growing a nice straight stem of timber; we don’t have any of that [here]” 
(IP3). 
5.3. The caring context in forests 
5.3.1. The social domain within which the caring relationship is located 
We found that the social domain within which forest management 
was located was discussed by participants in terms of management ob-
jectives, decision-making processes, and knowledge networks. At this 
site, the management team aimed to conserve the forest while main -
taining access for public recreation. This resulted in differences of 
opinion over which objective had priority; one participant said: “… 
ecology-wise and natural history … put a big wall round it” (IP10), while 
another concluded: “We don’t want to put a big fence around it and say 
‘You can’t come in’, it’s very much open access” (IP3). These objectives 
were perceived by some as mutually exclusive, with participants 
describing the impact of increasing visitor numbers in terms of ecolog -
ical damage, such as soil compaction or fungi picking. Others main -
tained that without public access the forest’s future would be uncertain: 
“If you’re going to reduce the number of people that go to the wood … 
there’s not much point in having the wood. I would go that far” (IP5). 
As a public organisation, formal decision-making processes existed at 
every level. Local interest groups lobbied the authority, and their 
knowledge was sometimes called upon, yet some participants from 
community organisations felt that they were not consulted enough. 
Public attachment to the forest meant that staff felt that communications T. O’Flynn et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Journal of Rural Studies 86 (2021) 226–235
232about caring operations risked negative responses: “… trees do need to 
be removed sometimes … it’s that whole thing about making people 
understand and sometimes you can’t, they just simply won’t accept it”. 
(IP7). 
Care-givers required knowledge and skills to perform their caring 
activities. Occupational knowledge was shared though training, events 
and social structures such as professional organisations and biosecurity 
groups. Sources of leisure-based knowledge involved family, local 
groups, site visits, and observation. The role of nonhuman networks was 
also acknowledged as supporting the forest’s natural regeneration: 
“We do have a lot of regeneration … [planted] trees just don’t 
establish as well as a tree that’s done it itself … It’s got all its 
mycorrhizal connectivity” (IP10). 
The social structures of decision-making in the authority included 
the public, while other local people proactively engaged through vol-
unteering. Human social structures acted as knowledge exchanges for 
care-givers, while nonhuman networks supported the establishment of 
new trees. 
5.3.2. The economic character of the care relationship 
The main economic distinction identified in the literature is between 
the waged and unwaged nature of caring. While the uncompensated care 
work of nonhumans was conceptualised as NCPs, waged and unwaged 
human work was a feature in the Forest. Some staff purportedly took a 
pay cut to work in the forest: 
“we have incredibly talented arborists, many of which could earn a 
great deal more in the private sector dragging Leylandii out of peo-
ple’s back gardens” (IP8). 
In effect, these arborists worked partially unwaged because they 
were keen to work with ancient trees, while earlier we saw that forest 
staff worked in their leisure time out of their sense of obligation to the 
forest. Volunteers, on the other hand, were unpaid and through their 
caring activities fulfilled personal obligations to the forest: “we are 
happy to volunteer without reward, because we see it as a contribution 
to the environment” (IP14). Unwaged volunteers were of economic 
benefit to the institution, severe financial restraints in the public sector 
means that cost-cutting and income generation had become increasingly 
important: “we’ve identified that this is an expensive thing to do and to 
do it well we need more income” (IP8). 
The authority adapted to these financial pressures by adjusting the 
management objectives, imposing income goals and expenditure limits, 
with implications for their caring obligations: “You can’t just do the 
management for the benefit of wildlife, that’s one of the motivations, but 
I think there has to be an economic aspect to it as well” (IP3). Economic 
pressures meant reprioritisation of scarce resources to meet demands, 
such as removing unsafe trees and costs relating to pests and diseases, 
particularly notifiable pests where monitoring and treatment was a legal 
requirement. One described the ecological and economic factors 
involved in selecting a pesticide: 
“One’s more specific but you can only do it at certain times of the 
year … [or] you have to use this general one which just wipes out 
every Lepidoptera … And it’s a massive amount of money as well” 
(IP10). 
In this forest some paid staff also carried out unpaid caring work, 
while unpaid volunteers supplemented limited paid human resources. 
Maintaining caring activities in the face of financial pressures meant 
forest managers were turning towards managing nonhumans to yield 
NCPs and income for humans in order to pay for tree care. 
5.3.3. The institutional setting in which care is delivered 
The care literature defines the institutional care setting as the 
physical location of caring activities and, in Greenshire Forest, there were several. First, the forest was the primary care setting, with care for 
nonhumans taking place according to management priorities and 
resource availability. Parts of the site were the setting for legally 
required care activities relating to nature conservation. 
Second, administration as a caring activity occurred at different 
levels of the institution. At the operational level, it took place around the 
forest in offices, meeting rooms, vehicles, and other spaces used by care- 
givers. Strategic planning and decision-making took place at the in-
stitution’s urban headquarters, in offices and formal committee rooms, 
involving legal procedures and long-established protocols. The histori -
cal narrative was important to management coherence between the 
caring locations: 
“it’s being true to our history … we don’t need a creation myth, 
we’ve got a very well documented story about why we’re created but 
we’ve in many cases lost contact with it. So it’s important to keep 
telling that story to modern audiences” (IP8). 
Earlier, participants suggested that distance from the forest dimin -
ished an individual’s commitment to its care, yet here we see that care 
extended spatially beyond the open air of the forest to other spaces, such 
as institutional buildings. In a large organisation, administration 
relating to strategy, finance, and policy were essential to the execution 
of operational caring activities in the forest. Although one participant 
suggested that “the real work is done” (IP2) when committee members 
held their regular visits to the forest, in this case, the main locus of power 
was away from the forest. 
6.Discussion 
Returning to John in our opening vignette, forest management, as 
practice and attendant decision-making, can be framed as care work. 
This is particularly evident in Greenshire Forest where forest manage -
ment contends with ill health of any species or ecosystem and is moti-
vated by a broad set of objectives including conservation and recreation. 
We consider forest management as caring relationships between humans 
and nonhumans that influence and inform decision making and prac-
tices. The gaps identified in the literature call for greater qualitative 
attention to be paid to how forest management is practised, to achieve a 
more reflective and reflexive practice. At a time of increasing threats to 
trees, this paper shows the relevance of a theory of care to forest man-
agement as it relates to motivations for action, mutualistic relations 
between humans and nonhumans, and the complex relationships in 
which decision-making is situated. Framings of forest management re-
lationships as stewardship have started to include care as a dimension of 
that relationship along with knowledge, and agency/practice/enact -
ment (Engvist et al., 2018; West et al., 2018). Following from our 
in-depth case study in Greenshire Forest, in Table 2, we reprise Thomas’ 
seven dimensions of care as they might apply to human-nonhuman re-
lationships. We identify how knowledge, agency, and enactment stem 
from care, offering four areas of insight relating to the opportunities 
identified earlier. 
6.1. Care underpins the work of forest management 
Care – as both feeling and activity – underpins and motivates forest 
management. Care is embodied and expressed as an emotional invest -
ment that draws on positive attachments to individual trees and other 
elements of the forest, as well as feelings of grief and unease over its 
future. Regardless of their role in the forest, our participants described 
emotional embeddedness in the forest, for some starting in childhood 
and for others spanning their career and multiple different jobs. While 
this might be more particular to forests with primarily conservation and 
recreation management objectives, these objectives are becoming 
increasingly prominent across forest types. 
Participants in our research rarely described a distinction between T. O’Flynn et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Journal of Rural Studies 86 (2021) 226–235
233occupational and personal interests (a point also made by Peltola and 
Tuomisaari 2016), rather they oscillated between these roles, main -
taining their enthusiasm for and emotional investment in the forest. As 
an activity, care involves a range of tasks. Some of these tasks are 
practical and hands-on with trees, others draw on expert knowledge, 
others involve detailed administration, policy, planning, funding ap-
plications. In forest management, paperwork is care. For many, emo-
tions motivated action that was not just tree-related; for others, such 
activities were part of the job. Emotion and activity are mutually rein-
forcing, leading to increased knowledge and expertise. This is not to say 
that care gives rise to undisputed decision-making, outcomes may be 
uncertain or may compromise some objectives while meeting others. 
These sometimes-conflicting positions are compounded by the forest 
itself, an ever-changing and contested space that serves multiple ob-
jectives concurrently: conservation site, public recreation space, income 
generation. Familiarity and personal commitment might be mobilised to 
challenge decision-making, with views strongly and passionately held, 
while statutory obligations mean that care-taking involves compliance, 
sometimes mediated by personal preferences or local priorities. For 
some, their personal activities gave them agency to act on care in a way 
that might be constrained within their professional roles. 
Therefore, understanding the social domain of forest management, 
for example management objectives and decision-making processes, is 
as important as understanding the on-the-ground practices of forest management. 
6.2. Multi-dimensional care 
Care is multi-dimensional across space, time and, as described above, 
social domains. Tree health management brings the spatial implications 
of decision-making into focus, with national policies being applied at a 
local level having implications that go beyond the issue in question. In 
Greenshire Forest, when discussing how statutory obligations required 
trees infested with notifiable pests to be treated with insecticides, this 
had direct negative implications for other insect species and drew re-
sources away from actions which would benefit trees with higher con-
servation priority. Yet, care-work maintains the forest even as 
management objectives shift, pests and diseases increase, or career paths 
divert. 
This dimension of time has resonance when thinking with trees, 
where the interconnected and interdependent lifespans - from centuries 
to days - of multiple species, are overlaid with the short-term timescales 
of human management and decision-making. The implications of man-
agement decisions in the past play out in the present and the very 
landscape that the managers of Greenshire Forest sought to conserve is 
an artefact of social and cultural human-nonhuman history. The legacy 
of their caring activities was an important consideration for our par-
ticipants and while conservation management objectives at Greenshire 
Forest allowed managers to take a longer-term perspective than timber 
production managers, tree timescales give forest managers, no matter 
the objectives, a responsibility that will likely last beyond their time in 
the role and even their lifetimes. 
6.3. Care as relational 
Forest management decisions involve complex caring relations be-
tween humans and nonhumans. Care is given and received in more than 
one direction: between humans and between nonhumans and humans. 
While the personal and professional emotional bonds that our partici -
pants felt for the nonhumans in their care were satisfied through caring 
activities, their care for the forest has wider societal benefit in terms of 
nature’s contributions to people. For some the conservation objectives of 
the forest were about protecting the intrinsic value of the forest as a 
whole or a particular group of species, which inevitably led to a hier-
archy of priority species, undoubtedly influenced by personal prefer -
ences, with those of greatest perceived conservation value getting most 
care. In Greenshire Forest, often unacknowledged personal subjectivities 
influenced decision-making yet ‘evidence-based’ policy often discounts 
social and cultural values. 
Prioritising nonhumans led inevitably to conflict with recreation and 
access objectives, as human well-being is bound up in caring for nature 
as a space for leisure and recreation (Jax et al., 2018), even when the 
benefits to wider society may negatively impact parts of that nature. 
Funding for conservation management is dependent on expressions of 
care for nature, as manifested through policies, and the trade-off be-
tween human and nonhuman wellbeing is not always explicit. 
6.4. Enacting care 
While the challenge of thinking with nonhumans, and particularly 
plants, remains, care for them, for their own benefit and the benefit of 
humans, is apparent through the emotional bonds that our participants 
describe. Like Jax et al. (2018), we found that the ability of our par-
ticipants to enact that care within the functionalist and rationalist sys-
tem that they operate in was problematic. Our analysis shows that 
emotions are highly influential in decision-making. Acknowledging this 
and making space for them would allow humans to give greater repre -
sentation to the interests of nonhumans as they see them. Our partici -
pants had found ways to subvert official narratives of forest ill health by 
developing treatments and research based on their own observations, Table 2 
The seven dimensions of care applied to human-nonhuman relationships (based 
on Thomas, 1993).  
Care-giver and care-recipient 
1. Social identity of the care-giver Humans care for nonhumans in both 
professional and personal roles, underpinned 
by caring feelings. 
2. Social identity of the care- 
recipient Nonhumans receive care according to 
hierarchies socially constructed by care- 
givers’ preferences and policy objectives. 
The nature of caring relations 
3. Inter-personal relationships 
between care-giver and care- 
recipient Human care-givers’ personal commitment 
derives from familiarity with and proximity 
to nonhumans in occupational and personal 
roles over extended periods. 
Institutional caring is influenced by legal 
obligations and social norms. 
Nonhumans offer contributions to all 
humans, whether care-givers or not. These 
contributions could also be described as care. 
4. Nature of care Caring feelings for nonhumans include 
affection, love, sadness, and fear for the 
future. 
Caring activities occur in direct contact with 
nonhumans, as well as being mediated 
through decision-making. 
The outcomes of care are not positive for all 
organisms. 
The outcomes of care may not be immediate, 
temporally or spatially, but may emerge in 
the future or at a distance. 
Caring context 
5. Social domain of the caring 
relationship Caring for nonhumans is enacted through 
formal (professional and amateur) and 
informal (personal) social structures. 
6. Economic character of the care 
relationship Care work by humans is paid and unpaid, 
often motivated by a strong attachment to 
nature. Humans manage natural assets to 
yield nature’s contributions to people, with 
the expectation that nonhumans will make 
reciprocal contributions to people. 
7. Institutional setting in which care 
is delivered The location of caring activities extends

234but resources were limited as these actions were semi-official. Entan -
glement holds the key to management in uncertain times. While our 
work was conducted in a forest with primarily conservation and recre -
ation management objectives, ill health is just as dominant an issue in 
production forests. Allowing emotion, and consequently care, into forest 
management would allow space for more creative responses to ill health. 
7.Conclusion: challenges and potentialities of caring for trees 
In this paper, we have examined the empirical realities of conser -
vation forest management at a UK publicly owned site to reveal the 
social, economic, and institutional contexts of care and caring relations 
and their role in management decisions. This in-depth qualitative case 
study has shown (1) that care underpins the work of forest management, 
(2) that care is multidimensional across time and space, (3) that forest 
management decisions are influenced by caring relations and emotions 
and (4) that forests are made and sustained through caring practices. In 
this context trees have emerged as both care-recipient and care-giver, 
motivating human actors to care for and about them. While we do not 
claim transferability of our analysis to other forests, these insights have 
resonated strongly with forest managers from other UK locations 
attending our Data Party. Therefore, we consider this paper as a first step 
towards encouraging those involved in forest management research, 
policy, and practice, to make space for care to support decisions that 
align with people ’s relational understanding of and emotional invest -
ment in forest management. 
We have also extended care theory by applying the well-established 
components of care in a new setting which involves caring relations 
between humans and nonhumans and demonstrated the potential of the 
single case study for deeply contextual forest and conservation research. 
In the context of increasing threats to tree health and where economic 
pressures mean not all care-recipients can be cared for equally, further 
questions arise: what is ‘good ’ care and what are the moralities involved 
when vulnerability and dependency are often central to the care of 
nonhumans? To further refine our understanding of care in forest 
management, we suggest future research applies the care framework in 
other settings, for example in commercial timber production and urban 
areas, in the UK and internationally. Social scientists interested in care, 
and researchers working in and around forests, could usefully learn from 
a more care-full attention to the on-the-ground relations between people 
and trees. If forest management in the 21st century recognises care and 
caring relations it could better support people like John in our vignette 
to continue to care for and about forests.
