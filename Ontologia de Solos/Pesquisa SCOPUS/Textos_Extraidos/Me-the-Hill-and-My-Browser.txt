ABSTRACT
Despite the growing concerns related to environmental disrup-
tions, such as forest fires and floods, our interaction with nature
has become increasingly distant. The belief is that this is due to
human attunement to quick changes over short periods, while nat-
ural changes seem slow-paced over the long term. We argue that
rather than the problem lying with the pace of time, humans should
further attune to the various temporalities within nature. To un-
pack this topic, we follow a two-fold process: Research through
Design and Autobiographical Design. The resulting prototype takes
environmental sensor data and visualises the changes happening
over a short time. We complement this IT-supported process with
think-aloud walks, a practice that is embodied and devoid of tech-
nology, for a plural perspective on time. We offer insights into how
noticing the various temporalities in nature was enabled, finally ar-
guing for designs that support progressive adjustments that sustain
human-nonhuman mutualism.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there have been growing concerns with environ-
mental disruptions that affect humans, such as forest fires, floods,
and heatwaves, whilst our interaction with nature is becoming
increasingly distant. It has been argued that this disharmony is
influenced by how humans and nonhumans operate on different
timescales [ 55]. Humans, supported by digital technologies, are

https://doi.org/10.1145/3546155.3546651increasingly attuned to quick and immediate events over short pe-
riods, while nature is seen as long-term, with changes occurring
at a slow pace. This argued perspective has, for example, informed
artistic design explorations [ 47,52], resulting in various works that
convey the idea of compacting the long-term changes that occur in
nature into a human time scale. In this study, we instead investigate
the proposition that the lack of human attunement to the vari-
ous temporalities within nature generates the distancing between
humans and nonhumans. Constrained by existing human conven-
tions of time, e.g. clock time, ecological transformations escape
our comprehension [ 9]. Thus, the idea of time seems unaffected
by more-than-human experiences. This perspective refers to the
position of tempus nullius seen as " nobody’s time ", "an unclaimed
territory that is similarly devoid of inhabitants " [36]. If that is the
case, we need to acknowledge the role of nonhuman temporali-
ties and design for interaction with nonhumans along many time
dimensions.
As nature operates outside the recognized human conventions
of time, this creates the illusion of nature being without agency
[8]. Puig de la Bellacasa [ 70] exposes how the treatment of soil is
entangled with the time of capitalism, seeking maximum value and
productivity, which contradicts the time of the soil that requires
pauses for regeneration. The misalignment between clock-time and
other time dimensions is particularly noticeable in two research
areas, i.e. enabling interaction with the environment that allows for
sustainable living and designing research on user-friendly nonhu-
man computer interaction, such as the field of Animal-Computer
Interaction (ACI). First, clock time disconnects us from the transfor-
mations occurring within natural environments. As nature becomes
more unpredictable due to the climate crisis, humans need to re-
connect to nature. Reductive frameworks of time, such as clocks
and calendars, are limited in their ability to portray long-term phe-
nomena and thus, distances humans from engaging with these
transformations. Second, the field of ACI takes the nonhuman as
the user in focus to develop information technologies that satisfy
their needs. While identifying those needs is an important issue to
solve, the role of time in interacting with a nonhuman is similarly
impacting. Aspling [ 5] p.86 argues for prolonging the interaction
supported by design since nonhumans operate over a longer term
timescale than humans. That perspective is specifically evident
when developing interaction design for plants [ 6,66], where pro-
longing the interaction can span over decades and centuries.
Thus, in specific, we ask how can we, through design, present
the discrete environmental changes occurring over time within hu-
man time dimensions in a way that adds to human’s relation to
nonhumans? We argue for the need to investigate how a design
system can call attention to short-term natural changes, such as

those repeatedly occurring in social life, that would encourage a
switch from human attention to culture to a better attunement to
nonhumans and a better relationship with nature. While ideas of
time in HCI continue developing [ 27,40,60,75,83], the absence
of perspectives that explore human-nonhuman time is noticeable.
Within these spaces, while notions and representations of time
have been rethought [ 16,69], these have been primarily human-
centred, with Lee et al.’s interactive object LUNE used to investigate
how moon phases can represent time [ 38] among the exception.
With the argument of current time-keeping technologies giving
us a false sense of control [ 9] by generating an illusion kept away
from environmental impact, we need to consider both our human
time and nature time concurrently. Such a holistic approach aligns
with the heterogeneous perspective of Posthumanism, in which
we decenter the human from the assemblage. In research, time is
further conceived as an experience and a social relation. It is an
experience since change is situated, embodied and differs from one
person to another, creating that discrepancy between the flow of
time shown on clocks and the one we feel and experience in our
bodies. Social time is a feature of how practices and tasks are syn-
chronised, sequenced, and paced in order to support collaboration.
In this broader perspective, we suggest investigating how to attune
human time with nonhuman time, specifically time and nature as a
co-experience as well as a human-nonhuman relational time.
For achieving this, we use the methods of Research through
Design (RtD) [ 94], and Autobiographical Design [ 57]. We created a
physical and digital prototype that depicts in a browser the subtle
environmental changes resulting over time in the research site -
an observational spot where the First Author, further referred to
as FA, has been engaging with through walks since March 2020.
We based these changes on four sensor data: light, temperature,
humidity, and soil moisture. Each set of environmental data deter-
mines an aspect of how we think of time and is visualised on a web
page through a graphic filter. For example, a light change affects
the brightness level of the web page. We complemented the daily
use of the system with think-aloud walks in the surroundings of
where the prototype was installed. FA underwent both these prac-
tices. Following this process, we learned that an important aspect
of living with nonhumans is uncovering their various temporal
aspects. Living within two cultures of time, human and nonhuman,
required adjustments and more active engagement from FA. Having
the reporting of short-term events in nature presented as graphic
distortions on the browser made FA imagine the physical research
site in her mind’s eye, especially when these events occurred in a
tempo that fitted with her own culture of time. Having said that,
the abundance of events occurring on the research site intruded on
her well-timed life as a researcher. The technology also introduced
a new element between the human and the nonhuman in the same
way humans can come between a person and their interaction with
nature. In the following, we explore the diverse categorisations of
time within social sciences, humanities and HCI. It allows for a
more inclusive discussion on the struggles with bringing together
two distinct time cultures within design. We open up the space for
this discussion by exploring artistic work that engages with the
topic of time within more-than-human worlds.2 RELATED WORK
Since we address time in human-nonhuman interaction, we first
address previous conceptualisations of time in human culture. We
visit theoretical discussions in social sciences, humanities, and HCI.
Additionally, we address the topic of time and nature and recount
diverse projects that aim to topicalise ways to interact beyond clock
times in relations that include nature in areas related to design and
art. Previous art and design investigations have become stepping
stones to address the gap in investigations of our topic within
design-led research.
2.1 Research on Time
There are many ways to categorise time [ 3,4,17]. The most common
approaches discuss time as a measurable concept, an experience,
or a social relation.
2.1.1 Clock Time. Clock time can be defined as linear episodes
with a beginning, middle and end. It is quantitative, measurable
and logical. Time as linear aligns with the Greek time concept of
chronos [30]. Within this aspect of time, actions are quantitative,
ordered, decontextualised, and constrained by clock time units.
Time is seemingly unaffected by external factors such as context
[2] or human emotions [ 8]. This particular form of time has co-
evolved together with different time-keeping technologies [ 41],
usually represented through the figure of a clock.
2.1.2 Existential Time. The idea of ’existential time’, often referred
to as kairos is the living time of experiences and intentions [ 26]
p.33. It is subjective, connects to the perception of change, how
not all types of changes are equally considered and depends on
who registers the change [ 9]. Although personally and individually
felt, existential time is affected by others, which makes it easy for
more dominant expressions of time to take space. For example,
certain events distort our sense of time, such as a global pandemic
affecting our felt rhythms. Similarly, this aspect of time can also
be fabricated by digital technologies through their design and our
use [ 41]. We see existential time represented through plastic and
digital time within design-led research. Plastic time was introduced
by Rattenbury et al. [ 76], depicting the empty time spaces within
technology use [ 92], such as when scrolling through social media.
Whereas digital time, examined by Tomlinson [ 87] and Rushkoff
[79], points to the aspect of constant connectivity and the condition
of immediacy with digital technologies [ 41]. Recent design-oriented
research engages with ideas of time that challenge the tradition
of time as linear (i.e. rational, predictive, manageable) [ 8]. They
explore forms of slow technologies [ 25,59,64] to contrast with
fast technologies created to save time, be efficient and have a high-
performance [ 41]. These design inquiries related to finding new
ways of representing time [ 92] and personal perceptions of time
[49].
2.1.3 Time as Social Relations. Social time is fundamentally a fea-
ture of the ways through which practices and tasks are synchronised
with each other, and it is an expression of the need for social col-
laboration. It is " the change or movement of social phenomena in
terms of other social phenomena taken as points of reference " [26]
p.58. Social time has three features: synchronisation, sequence and
rate. Synchronisation relates to the requirement for simultaneous
Me, the Hill and My Browser – Investigating the Role of Time in Posthuman Interaction NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark
actions. Sequence refers to a demand for a specific ordering. Finally,
rate points to the importance of the frequency of events in a time-
frame. Within design research, scholars have unpacked perceptions
of social time, i.e. right time andcollective time [92]. Right time or
thesituational when was proposed by Taylor et al. [ 82] as a concept
that describes the various converging circumstances that make an
event take place, evocative of a combination of temporal attributes
such as synchronisation and timing. Followed by collective time,
discussed by Lindley [ 41] on time as entangled within social rela-
tions. The plurality of perceptions of time combine with the idea of
social time, in which the rhythms of different actors synchronise,
follow a certain order and thus, create an experience in time [ 39].
As a socially-situated experience, " it is not that we have or do not
have time, but that we make it through practices " [70]. Differenti-
ating between measuring systems should be about understanding
how change occurs rather than how time ’flows,’ acknowledging
the various agency distribution between human and nonhuman
actors [8, 24].
2.1.4 Time and Nature. Human conceptions of time have histor-
ically been linked to natural events, such as tracking the sun’s
position. Such features, however, are challenging to coordinate
with when needing more precision, such as when scheduling a
meeting. As a clock depends on its material functionalities and
thus, might not apply to other contexts [ 9], each mode of telling
time affords specific interactions. The dominant understanding of
time as linear and measurable is most often represented by time-
keeping technologies such as the figure of a clock. However, this
orientation away from natural phenomenon, has been criticized
for "obscur[ing] more complex understandings of time " [10] such as
relations that pertain to ecological changes [ 9]. This is ineffective to
our understanding and perception of changes in the natural world
[93]. Regarding the figure of the clock, Michelle Bastian proposes a
broader definition: clocks involve choices on what aspects of our
world are most significant to us and worth keeping time. It thus be-
comes " a device that signals change in order for its users to maintain
an awareness of, and thus be able to coordinate themselves with, what
is significant to them " [9]. An important issue with current clock
time tools is that they obstruct and constrain explorations of time
that require a set of diverse perspectives [ 68]. Taking the example
of clocks, the problem with this modality is the lack of possibility
to move from quantitative to qualitative time expressions [9].
As discussed in [ 93], "the clock does not measure time; it produces
it." It has been argued that a cyclical notion of time that relates to
noticing recurring patterns, constituted of relationships and more-
than-human interdependence [ 15], shows a more subjective and
embodied perception of time. Anna Tsing’s collaborative survival
depicted through the relationship formed between matsutake mush-
rooms, human-disturbed forests, and foragers is one example of
when multiple timescales unify and constantly reoccur [ 88]. In this
form, humans have the ability to respond to environmental changes.
Puig de la Bellacasa argues for care time as a form of making time
that reveals the multiple more-than-human temporalities that unite
in cycles of soil growth and decay [ 70]. This aspect of time and care
includes an advocacy for slowness that goes against the dominant
fast-paced always-on, always-connected and always available that
characterise today’s digitally-mediated societies. By disregardingthe pluralistic quality of time, humans contribute to " the exclu-
sion of certain practices, individuals, and natures, and supports the
dominance of others " [67]. Tsing’s use of polyphony expresses the
notion of being attuned to the simultaneous melodies and noticing
the moments of harmony and dissonance, the melodies becoming
an analogy for " multiple temporal rhythms and trajectories of the
assemblage " [88] p.24. Within environmental humanities, scholars
have engaged with rethinking time in a more-than-human world.
Michelle Bastian’s work reflects on the correlation between time
and agency, defining time in relation to change and as enacted by
both human and other-than-human beings [8].
In sum, related research establishes that there is more to time
than linear and measurable. It also states that such a broader un-
derstanding is particularly relevant when it comes to interaction
between humans and nonhumans. We also note that although this
challenge is made clear and explicit in research, there is a lack of
concrete design research that addresses the topic.
2.2 Artistic Explorations of Nature, Time and
Technology
In our attempt to account for time in interaction with nonhumans,
we also take inspiration from artistic explorations that address
time ideas from a more-than-human perspective, i.e. compressing
nature’s long duration of change into a small graphic representation
or when challenging the clock metaphor.
2.2.1 Compressing Time. Projects such as Deep Time Walk [89],
The Room of Change [52] and Keeping Time [13] address how a
long-term change in nature, which defies standard clock technol-
ogy, should be visualized. The encompassing expression in this type
of work is to present a compressed time scale graphically. They do
so, for example, through an immersive guided and narrated walk
that recounts the Earth’s history throughout its 4.6bn years of exis-
tence in Deep Time Walk (for visual reference, see [ 90]). Similarly,
through an installation of 30-meters-long hand-crafted data tapestry
[52] of changes in our environment that happened, are happening,
and will possibly happen in The Room of Change (for visual refer-
ence, see [ 53]). These projects also refer to a specific understanding
of time, such as the concept of deep time related to the magnitude of
the Earth’s age. Duarte et al. explain this difficult-to-grasp concept
as follows: " in a 12-hour analogy of Earth’s estimated age, humans
have existed approximately only for the last 19 seconds " [19]. With
The Room of Change andKeeping Time , we notice a weaving of sto-
ries and relationships between humans and different environment
levels, from technology to the animal or plant kingdom. The Room
of Change expresses time through this kind of all-encompassing
display because we usually experience changes " from far away and
high above " [52]. Thus, the work depicts change through these vari-
ous scales and dimensions represented in the form of a data-driven
wallpaper. While Keeping Time uses photos to represent human
experiences of nonhumans (for visual reference, see [ 14]), pointing
to how plants become visible to humans only in particular moments
of their life cycle, usually in spring when they flower or autumn
when their life cycle ends. The goal of this design case is to show
different " seasonal and cultural correletions " in visualization-based
work, and more so the rising interest in phenology studies due to
environmental disruptions in this age of the Anthropocene [56].

2.2.2 Redefining the Clock. Another type of expression in this
genre, while maintaining the circular figure of the clock, looks into
different ideas and notions of time. The clock expressions range
from representations of time and nature, such as in The Present [85]
and Circa [28] where the clock units are defined by the current
appearance of the sun from sunrise to sunset (for visual reference,
see [ 86] and [ 29] respectively), to representations that span life
cycles, such as the evolution of life on Earth displayed in one of the
clocks in Allochronic Cycles or of different species from a certain
ecosystem in The Phenology Clock [31] (for visual reference, see [ 48]
and [ 32] respectively). As with the previous projects, there are artic-
ulations of new notions of time. Allochronic Cycles refers to " being
out of step with a geological epoch " [47], while The Phenology Clock
points to the science of phenology: " the study of patterns, rhythms,
and evolved temporal interdependencies between multiple lifeforms "
[15]. The work of Unequal Hours [77] combines all these different
expressions of time, the clocks moving at different rates according
to "various natural, human and technological timescales, for example
tides and eclipse cycles, rhythms of the human body, and local trans-
port schedules " [11]. This variety of temporalities would allow the
ribbons to entangle and potentially stop the clocks, showing how
natural time cycles are affected by environmental disruptions and
how as a result, they fall out of sync (for visual reference, see [ 78]).
Thus, through this installation, the artist explores the intersection
between natural cycles and human frameworks of time, pointing
back to a period before time was coordinated and synchronized.
In sum, although constrained by the clock metaphor, we find
the artistic design expressions above inspiring since they address
the time dimension in nature while supporting human’s direct in-
volvement in the interaction. However, they all focus on visualizing
change over a long duration of time, which differs from the ap-
proach taken in our study that targets short-term natural changes,
encouraging a change from human attention to culture to a noticing
and an improved understanding of nonhumans.
3 METHODS & DESIGN PROCESS
We follow a design-led approach, which combines Research through
Design (RtD) [ 94], and Autobiographical Design [ 57]. In RtD, thedesign process is used as a resource to reveal learnings and sup-
port transgressive thinking [ 7]. It has already been used to inves-
tigate posthuman topics [ 22,42,44]. Autobiographical Design is
the second method used. It is defined as " design research drawing
on extensive, genuine usage by those creating or building the sys-
tem" [57]. Autobiographical Design is a form of autoethnography
within design and HCI, focusing on the individual experience with
a technical system. This type of first-person inquiry is increasingly
visible in HCI [ 18,23,45,51] with works that follow posthuman
epistemologies using it as well [ 12,42,72]. In this study, rather than
creating a prototype for FA’s personal use, we were motivated to
explore the topic of time restructured from a more-than-human
perspective. This included FA’s own embodied experiences of this
time governed by environmental changes. We thus focused on the
"unique experiential dimensions " [57] that arose throughout the de-
sign process. In the following, we will describe the subtleties of the
IT-supported aspect of the process - the prototype, and how we
conceptualized time through four different sensor readings. The
prototype was supplemented by the think-aloud walks, further
describing an embodied practice devoid of technology.
3.1 Constructing the Prototype
We created a physical and digital prototype that visualises various
short-term changes over time on the current web page based on
the received environmental sensor data (see Figure 1). Similarly
to [1], our prototype depends on different environmental changes
detected through sensors that collect light, temperature, humidity,
and soil moisture data. We use clock time units, such as seconds,
to determine whether a change has occurred. Every 300 seconds,
there were sensor readings between 9 AM and 10 PM. What deter-
mines if we consider the sensor reading is if there is a difference
of more than 1% from the last reading. The 1% is different for each
environmental data, based on predetermined values or the mini-
mum and maximum values recorded for that period. For example,
humidity is calculated in percentage, and thus the value is in it-
self 1%. Whereas temperature, the 1% was calculated based on the
month’s min and max recorded values in the prototype installa-
tion site. The sensor data that does account for a change is saved

Figure 1: The figure depicts the research site and the setup of the prototype. Picture a presents the observational point where
the prototype was placed and through which FA passed during her think-aloud walks. The prototype was placed between
two trees (b), with the soil moisture sensor placed in the soil between those trees (c), and the other three sensors ( humidity,
temperature and light) remaining in the box (d). The phone provided the wireless connection to a cloud-hosted database, which
triggered the browser extension to make changes to the active web page and a power bank that kept the phone charged.
Me, the Hill and My Browser – Investigating the Role of Time in Posthuman Interaction NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark
in a cloud-hosted database, triggering different modifications to
the current web page through a browser extension. Thus, when
a change was registered, the browser extension applied a specific
graphic filter on whichever web page FA was actively on at that
moment. When it was more humid at the installation site, the web
page was more opaque, while outdoor light determined the bright-
ness level of the web page. For example, after sunset, the web page
would have a darker brightness level, making it hard to see what is
on the page. Temperature changes were shown through the web
page’s background colour, ranging from red in high temperatures
(e.g. 30◦C) to blue in low temperatures (e.g. −10◦C). Finally, soil
moisture changes regulated the text-based information shown on
the page. The lower the soil moisture was, the more text-based
information on the page was missing. FA built and installed the
prototype at the top of Hagakullen, also known as Frösundatoppen,
in Stockholm, Sweden (see Figure 2).
3.2 Living with the Prototype
FA used the prototype daily over 20 days, from July 12 to July 31,
2021. She installed the browser extension on her computer, which
she used daily and thus interacted with throughout the day. The
device worked regardless of FA’s task, which meant it was part of
her work and leisure digital time. The use of the prototype was com-
plemented with think-aloud [ 58] p.195 walks through the research
site where FA installed the prototype. The place is a green area that
FA has, incidentally, been engaging with since March 2020. The hill
(see Figure 2) was originally 50 meters high above sea level. Then,
it was used as a gravel pit, which reduced it to half its size. Later, it
was decided to restore it to its previous height by adding demoli-
tion remains. The walks resulted in eleven think-aloud accounts, i.e.
recorded voice notes, which FA collected during July 2021, in paral-
lel with the use of the prototype. Each walk took around one hour,
with about thirty minutes of voice notes. Gathering data by walking
is an established methodology in social sciences and humanities
[81], used in this case as a situated and embodied practice of en-
gaging with nature. As thinking about time and conceptualising
time perspectives that include two different cultures is an intricate
challenge, FA performed these two parallel practices to have a dual
perspective of being attuned to the changes happening in nature.
The prototype provided the IT-supported modality of visualising
the changes, while the walks were the practice of interacting with
nature undisturbed by technology.3.3 Data Collection and Coding
Both parts of the study have sizeable qualitative data. First are FA’s
daily diary entries, where she wrote her thoughts and reflections
that occurred throughout the day related to the topic and the proto-
type use. Second are the transcribed accounts from the think-aloud
walks during which FA described what she saw in the research
site, the changes that she noticed over time of different nonhumans
(e.g. plants, animals, or other objects encountered) along with her
felt experience of walking. We used qualitative content analysis
to code the diary entries and transcripts. It is a research method
to systematically analyse and identify patterns and structures in
different types of content [ 35]. This method has foremost been used
in HCI to categorise and analyse user-generated content (e.g. [ 33]).
As autobiographical work emphasises descriptive details, such cod-
ing is suitable for interpreting the meaning behind the written, and
spoken experiences [ 80] p. 88. The data passed four joint analytic
inductive sessions between the authors to conceptualise underly-
ing categories. It resulted in conceptualising seven main themes
derived from combinations of six to thirty-four subcategories.
4 FINDINGS
This section presents the results of how nature was experienced
by FA when presented in a human-paced time dimension. In the
following, when we refer to the concept of disruption we designate
an event that unsettles human clock time through external environ-
mental triggers. This stems from ideas and events of environmental
disruptions. While when referring to pause(d) we point to a state
similar to before, seemingly devoid of change.
4.1 Nature’s Fickle Temporality
During this project, the walks revealed the heterogeneity of the
time perspective when engaging with nature. It seems like a one-
time walk makes time appear almost fixed, with changes over time
remaining hidden. However, the re-occurring walks made FA see
what had changed since the last visit and made her more sensitive
to the traces of change within the nonhuman temporality. Noticing
the multiple variations became a key element in experiencing that
environment. Notably, this is very similar to the accounts of Henry
David Thoreau and his long-term stay at the Walden Pond, where
he describes such traces of change in detail [84].
"You can already see some leaves, some yellowish leaves
from the trees. [...] a wild rose bush that has some flowers
Figure 2: Image of Frösundatoppen in Stockholm, Sweden, at sunset.
NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark Ciobanu and Juhlin
bloomed, but some of the leaves are turning yellow [...]
And here is the patch of the white flowers. They now
turned pinker, actually, and there are a lot of bees as
well. [...] The tree with the yellow flowers that now has
the beans, you can see that they are drying up as well,
turning yellow. [...] You can also see some of the leaves
turning yellow, for the wild rose bush [...] And also the
apple tree, some of the apples are turning red, a little bit
red. [...] And I like how this tree with the aeroplane-like
seeds, the seeds have turned some kind of dark pink,
reddish kind of colour. A brighter red than what I saw
before. [...] Different snails. Different shapes and sizes.
Different shell colours. Maybe you can also see the slugs,
but it’s harder. [...] It’s definitely snail season. Very hard
to see them because they are quite small. "
FA also noticed how many natural elements did not seem to
change during the think-aloud walking practice. Devoid of change,
these elements were seemingly paused at a particular stage of their
evolution. Whilst this state was undoubtedly temporary, there was
a sense that nature has periods during which time seems constant,
an uninterrupted flow with no ramifications. This sense of stillness
is imposed by the limits of our human senses, as FA could not
visually experience or trace any noticeable changes, even compared
to previous visits. This experience is, in a sense, a description of
a time frame during which nature is unfluctuating. This concept
of time frame connects with the idea of timing, defined as specific
moments in which a particular experience is possible. This form of
existential time is uncertain and unrelated to the quantifiable time
of the clock. The ideas of time frame and timing illustrate the shift
from control to indeterminacy that describes the more-than-human
turn [ 20], affected by the " unplanned nature of time " [88] p.20. Thus,
addressing time is a fickle target, where nature will not easily give
us the answers to our design-related questions.
4.2 Nature in the Mind’s Eye
On certain occasions, the remote short-term interactions broke
FA’s human practice barriers. FA remarked how the prototype was
a way of grounding oneself with the natural world. A change in
the environment that happened ’out there,’ represented through a
graphic filter, created the image of that change in FA’s mind’s eye.
These visuals allowed FA to experience an aesthetic enjoyment of
the visualisation while also envisioning being in that environment
at that moment. Each disruption was a regular reminder of things
that happened in the other world, the outdoor nature, which acted
as a prompt to look out the window and pause FA’s immersion in
task-dependent clock time:
"What would happen sometimes is that only when I saw
the light change shown as a disruption did I realise that
it started getting darker. When you are concentrated on
a task, and you are getting tired, but you do not really
notice it, in this case, it kind of "wakes you up" back to
reality. It grounds you in the "real" or "natural" world. "
This experience instilled the wish for FA to be outdoors in ’real
time’ and have an embodied experience of the changes. As therewere sometimes dissonances or misalignment with what FA per-
ceived from the place of the experience, i.e. indoors, being in nature
was perceived as a solution.
4.3 Active Engagement as Invaluable for
Noticing
Temporal changes in nature were more fully experienced by FA in
situations when the pace of her way of life fell in sync with the
changes.
"It was really nice this day because while there were
disruptions, they didn’t happen that frequently and
successively, so I really could take my time to see them
and understand that this is a temperature change and
this is a humidity change and even take the time to
check, if it didn’t show properly on the page, to see what
colour it is exactly as I wanted to see the change and
see if it got warmer or colder. "
This case entailed a need to pause and focus or circle back and no-
tice again but differently. FA remarked that there seems to be more
time to notice nature during her think-aloud practice than with the
prototype. Natural changes give space and time for when and what
to notice as there is room to decide how long to pay attention. Nev-
ertheless, with the prototype, when there were fewer disruptions,
there was time to appreciate and understand the changes, with the
frequency and variety of changes significant to noticing. Pauses
gave space to restart the overloaded senses for a fuller experience
and better appreciation. Noticing, however, does not imply that
one can be aware of everything happening at a point in time. There
were always changes that FA missed, whether unintentionally or
consciously. Thus, FA felt there was more of a need to engage with
the prototype than with the environment. FA believed that the
missed changes resulted from her not being present or attentive.
This sentiment, in turn, instilled in FA a feeling of missing out and
thus a requirement of always staying connected to be ’in the know’,
which could be applied both to the digital technology as well as to
the think-aloud walking practice. With the disruptions, their intru-
siveness was a factor that contributed to a more active engagement
in order to come back to human clock time. Once the disruption
passed, the chance to experience it was gone. Considering that
human clock time, which FA categorized into work time and leisure
time, was at times more critical and at other times less, there was
a personal decision included into which changes FA noticed and
which were consciously neglected [71] p.149.
4.4 Noticing Mediated and Unmediated
Changes in Nature
As stated in section 4.1, the temporal changes experienced during
recurring visits to a location in nature are of various durations. The
visitor engages with many traces to discern what has been hap-
pening. What differentiated FA’s experience of natural and digital
changes was that changes within an outdoor natural environment
were easier to pinpoint and remember later on. On the one hand,
while nature does have subtle changes with some usually unper-
ceivable, being in nature is an embodied experience. Thus, it was
Me, the Hill and My Browser – Investigating the Role of Time in Posthuman Interaction NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark
more memorable to recall the changes than the prototype unless
there was a pattern to detect.
"Comparing this to the walks/think–aloud, when you
go on these walks, you can notice the changes, and since
you’ve been in these places before, you can compare and
notice the differences and the results of these differences.
With the device, I wouldn’t be able to say precisely
what happened the day or days before as there were
many more changes simultaneously. Only situations
like this one, when there were different changes one
after the other, is something that can be memorable.
However, with the walks, something about the embodied
experience makes it more memorable. I could still recall
and retrace my walks and the changes I saw weeks
after. "
On the other hand, changes within human clock time tasks were
easier to detect and quantify. At the same time, usually, it was the
drastic natural changes that were detected, with only the result of
the change over time that was perceived.
"With human tasks, such as in this case, work-wise,
there is usually a quantitative way to measure progress
and change. With nature, it’s usually extreme changes
that we as humans can detect. But there is meaning in
"seeing" small changes and evolution, which is what I
experience with the walks. You could really see these
small changes in that environment ."
FA also felt more inclined to check through technology whether
a particular change happened rather than entirely relying on the
senses. This disposition created a discrepancy between the embod-
ied/felt data and the sensor-generated data, as sometimes these
did not align. This inconsistency, in turn, underlined the trouble of
the experimenter’s regress which FA solved in two ways. Firstly,
through local visits, i.e. being in the environment and seeing for
oneself, becoming a human sensor through the senses, comparing
the data with her own experience, and continuous device main-
tenance. Secondly, through pattern recognition, i.e. focusing on
the data and seeing the different combinations of natural changes
detected by the sensors.
With the prototype, the particularities of web page design cre-
ated differences in visually seeing a change and understanding its
components, which affected FA’s experience in visually seeing the
change and caused her to find other ways to compensate for the
missing information. Translating the sensors’ detections to a vi-
sual representation was a way to perceive when a window opened
between human clock time and nature time. FA’s usual human prac-
tice had to adapt to allow nature changes to be seen. By seeing the
disruptions on her browser, the different combinations and build-
ing a certain pattern recognition in the sensor data, the experience
slowly moved from technology-focused to nature-focused. Some
easily identifiable and circular changes, such as the passing from
dusk to dawn, were more easily followed along with FA’s clock time.
The prototype provided a ’walk-through-data’, whether physical
through the think-aloud walks or digital through the prototype.
This practice of the walking think-aloud and the use of the
prototype, going in and out of human clock time, became a rein-
terpretation of transhumant practice, a cyclical pattern betweenliving within and remotely to nature time. The recurring environ-
mental elements noticeable to FA stimulated a sensorial experience
of change, whether auditory or visually, which further instilled the
noticing of specific phenological patterns in nature. However, these
recurring changes lost a sense of newness with time, making FA
lose interest in seeing these similar changes. This predictability
created the challenge of keeping noticing.
4.5 From Disruption to Synchronization
The experience of clock time events in nature started as disruptions
but ended as synchronized with human life. The continuous visual-
ization of the events happening on the research site was sometimes
experienced as an inconvenience. The many changes that happened
in nature disrupted FA in her daily habits.
"[M]ore occurrences of changes happened in the second
half of the day, closer to the evening, which is usually
when you want to end the day and get into leisure time
or rest time, and then one disruption after the other
happens and feels like you cannot really appreciate it
because that is when it feels like nature is doing its
changes. So then it seems that my own human time and
nature’s time are asynchronous in terms of what and
when I would "accept" for her to disrupt my time. "
The interaction with nature is experienced as a continuous in-
trusion. The incoming notifications of events happening on the
research site made her think about how they diverted her attention
away from her tasks. She considered that the notification of events
should be synchronized with her daily routines. Human activities,
synched with the clock time, should then regulate when nature
events are allowed. The environmental changes decided when there
was a need to pay attention. The prototype became a mere vessel
that transported a change and showed it in a digital form. This prop-
erty, in turn, asked for the practice of human activities, supported
by clock time, to adapt their social time to acknowledge the natural
changes. As FA perceived these changes within digitally active hu-
man clock time, she found herself extending this active digital time
for more opportunities for nature time to blend in. While natural
blending was preferred, sometimes it felt more like a switch be-
tween a stream of events than blending human affairs with nature’s
affairs. When it felt like a switch, nature time felt invasive, even if
it was possible to anticipate. Eventually, this experience changed.
As the study advanced, FA started anticipating nature interrupting
her human clock time. This sense of anticipation, while seemingly
inherent in the experience, was more of a skill formed over time
and thus resulted out of habit. When FA noticed specific natural
changes outdoors, she anticipated future events, which made her
more alert and attuned to the following interventions of nature
time.
4.6 When Technology Gets in the Way
The challenge of this study is to design for short-term nonhuman
interaction with humans in a way that adds to formers’ relation to
the latter. In other words, to make humans notice nature. However,
the design adds technology between the two parts in ways that
guide or filter that relation. Natural elements such as temperature,
light and humidity have been interpreted as graphic filters, such as
NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark Ciobanu and Juhlin
opacity. FA noticed that differences between these filters guided her
attention, such as when events included several of them. Then her
attention was drawn to one of them on behalf of the other. Certain
changes were more dominant, which obfuscated other changes:
"when the before and after disruption contains a pre-
dominant element, such as temperature, that is the first
one to catch the attention. It does not seem like a change,
even if the light or humidity also changed, because you
cannot really notice it as well as the change is subtle ."
All these factors, in turn, transformed the experience along with
concealing other elements in the environment. In a sense, the FA
noticed the design rather than nature. Considering this as a dis-
turbance and following the idea that disturbances are a matter of
perspective [ 62], in an interesting turn, the FA tried to cope with this
by going for walks, almost like a calibration. In order to bring forth
less dominant elements or changes in the environment, FA would
switch the perspective by pausing and noticing the less dominant
environmental queues, triggering a peripheral awareness:
"I was looking up, which actually is something that
I haven’t really been doing, and I don’t, you know, I
haven’t been looking up that much. ."
This type of awareness, in turn, highlighted the rare occurrence
of natural elements that were not noticed otherwise or engaged the
noticing of recurrent elements. FA received new information that
was otherwise concealed when she was attuned to less dominant
elements, natural or otherwise, and by further changing the perspec-
tive of noticing. FA also highlighted the aspect of noticing different
elements as they are in time without needing to identify them. She
wondered if identifying a particular species in the environment or
having quantifiable information on a change causes more attuned
noticing. FA considered valuable enough to acknowledge what she
was seeing without being able to name it.
4.7 When Humans Get in the Way
Interestingly, the way that technology goes in the way of nature, as
described above, mirrors how humans got in the way of experienc-
ing the research site during the walks. The design was intended to
enable interaction between human and nature in new ways. How-
ever, it required her to handle unwanted human activities to sneak
into the interaction. FA felt a lack of possibility of fully immers-
ing in the experience of being in nature, as she felt interrupted by
the so-called ’out-of-nature elements’. These interruptions mainly
were the noise of the nearby highway or interference from elements
passing through the environment, such as other humans walking
or biking, which caused a change from the initially decided action.
These distractions from FA’s ’noticing time’ were overpowering,
which caused FA to be more alert and envision making changes
to the environment which would cause fewer interruptions to the
experience of being immersed in nature.
"I think this view, this mountain hill, is very nice if
it weren’t for the highway. Because it’s kind of, you
feel like you are in the forest, but then the sound of the
cars really makes you not fully immerse yourself in the
experience of being in nature ."Despite these dominant and sometimes unpleasant elements,
FA still had an aesthetic experience of being in that environment.
The interruptions were location and time-specific, as in the time of
day, week or season, and would increase or decrease in intensity,
influencing the noticing of the wild nature and its aesthetically
pleasing parts.
5 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss how the prototype enables an extended
relationship between humans and nonhumans with its specific
short time dimension. We also examine the potential of further
developing devices that incrementally attune us to nature, leading
to adapting to interdependent human-nonhuman temporalities
and eventually causing behavioural transformations for a more
relational interaction with nature.
5.1 Attuning to the Short-Term Temporalities
in Nature
We were interested in learning whether a system that reported short-
term events in nature, i.e. such as those constantly occurring in
social life, would be able to compete with human attention to culture.
In some sense, it did. The prototype helped FA notice ongoing
changes on the research site. It accentuated nature’s property as
constantly changing, which challenged FA’s experience during the
initial walk, during which she experienced nature as stable and
fixed. Thus, the system’s reporting of such events, presented as
graphic distortions on the browser page, made the user imagine the
location in her mind’s eye, especially when these events occurred in
a tempo that fit with her way of life. At the same time, the various
things that happened out there intruded on her well-timed life as a
researcher. The technology also introduced a new element between
the human and the nonhuman in the same way humans can come
between a person and her interaction with nature. In sum, it seems
like nature designing for various temporalities, not just long-term
change, matter as a way to increase our interaction with nature.
5.2 The Role of Context and a Plural Temporal
View
Within the topic of time, space is an important component. As
Adam claims, " [s]pace and time constitute the context and context
matters " [3]. We see the role of context with the two various prac-
tices of using the prototype and doing the think-aloud walks. Each
showed different expressions of nature’s temporalities. FA experi-
enced a slower, more uniform view of nature through the walks,
with changes happening slowly over longer periods. It was also
easier to remember the changes, construct patterns and compare
with previous visits. With the prototype, the FA experienced a con-
stant flow of changes occurring over the day, these representing
the often unnoticeable subtle changes that occur in nature. These
were also harder to remember since the flow of information was
much greater, entangling the understanding of nature time. Thus,
the technology disrupted FA’s clock time, allowing nature to take
space and FA to adjust to a new set of temporalities. This variety
of experiences of time was possible by combining an IT-supported
practice with one that is devoid of technology. We conceptualise
the notion of time as multiple rather than singular by using clock
Me, the Hill and My Browser – Investigating the Role of Time in Posthuman Interaction NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark
time units and visual representations understandable by and used
in human culture to translate notions of nature’s time that are
usually elusive. The work of Pschetz and Bastian [ 68] maintain
this belief by proposing temporal design as a pluralist alternative.
This concept presents time as emerging out of complex relations
which would help designers create artefacts that would " disclose
this variety, also revealing the intricacies of temporal relationships
and negotiations that take place ." With nature defining time, we
observed the ’struggles’ with maintaining focus on human clock
time tasks whilst attuning to natural temporalities. We considered
time " as emerging out of relations between cultural, social, economic
and political forces " [68] by living with a prototype that extends the
reach of time to natural rhythms.
5.3 Design Considerations for Exploring Time
in Posthuman Interaction
As the experience with the prototype was affected by an outpour
of changes, future development of technologies such as these is
finding a balance between being in touch with the processes in
nature whilst maintaining some form of human clock time. With
the artistic explorations we previously presented, the users initiated
interactions with the installations and mobile applications. The
human was deciding when to engage, how and for how long. With
the prototype, there is a form of pull between forces that govern
FA’s clock time and the multitude of human and nonhuman actors
involved in creating nature time. FA’s accounts are " not just from
knowledge, but from familiarity " [34]. The combination of the think-
aloud walks and the daily use of the prototype cultivated a sense
of nature as is. By intimately knowing and becoming familiar with
a particular place, the everyday closeness of an ’other’ grows.
We noticed that FA was inclined to use technology to check infor-
mation regarding the state of nature rather than entirely relying on
her senses. The technology became the main modality of verifying
if the assumption was valid. This suggests how we become more
dependent on technologies to perceive change rather than use our
senses to establish that. This idea corresponds to our reliance on
clocks, to the point that they govern our circadian rhythms and
social interactions, " a perilous distraction from an authentic engage-
ment with this temporality " [10]. This struggle between the urge
to quantify and abstain from it is noticeable within a world driven
by data and becoming more and more quantifiable, such as the
movement of the quantified self that seeks " self-knowledge through
numbers " [91]. Following the example of the quantified pets , one
critical perspective around such type of design is that there is a risk
that the guardian will be less understanding of the behaviour of
their animal companion, obstructing the human-nonhuman rela-
tionship [ 37]. Thus, instead of being attuned to the environmental
change, we focus on the quantified representation of that change.
The prototype helped FA ground herself back to the natural world’s
rhythm, becoming an alternative to the strict units of clock time.
Similarly, seeing the visually abstract representation of the changes
was sufficient for understanding that the change happened without
knowing the exact number. The prototype reinforced the view of
noticing the change without feeling the need for concrete numbers,
becoming a bridge between relying on technology for noticingchanges within our surroundings and focusing on the senses to per-
ceive the change. As it is argued in The Tree , [21], rather than solely
following conventional meaning-making by focusing on " identify-
ing, measuring, photographing ," we should practice and cultivate
attunement [46] to nature that is unguided.
Following the daily use of the prototype, FA experienced a sense
of anticipation of future changes. This quality seems to have re-
sulted from habit rather than inherent to nature or the design.
Within HCI research, the experience of anticipation surfaced out of
slow technologies over time [ 61]. As McCarthy and Wright explain,
anticipation occurs in two temporal phases, before the beginning
of the experience and during the experience, which is the time for
reflecting on whether the expectation was met, unmet or exceeded
[54] p.64. With the prototype, we see anticipation when FA noticed
a change in the environment and then waited for that change to
be visualised in the browser. With each expectation met, this con-
tributed to her being more attuned to the future interventions of
nature time. This is also what contributed to the periodical disso-
nance, or temporal confusion [9] between nature’s temporalities and
FA’s clock time, as the expectations of a change were left unmet.
The natural temporalities occurred, disregarding whether it was
convenient for FA. This resulted in FA adapting to the experience
and changing the usual practice of her clock time to actually be able
to notice and engage with the visualised changes. This adaptive
response, or transformation, is increasingly discussed in the climate
crisis discourse [ 63]. It can either forcibly result when a system
fails, such as a drought causing migration, or as a response to antic-
ipating a collapse, such as rising sea levels prompting resettlement
[65]. Our prototype exemplifies how incremental adjustment leads
to adapting to living within the intersection of two different time
cultures. Having similar devices that show small changes occurring
in the environment that actively engage the user can produce a
sense of anticipation and predict future happenings. Seeing and
interpreting these patterns in adaptation could, in turn, build to-
wards a multiple timescale sensibility that would reveal " long-term
consequences of lifestyles and materialities " [74]. This would thus
create opportunities for implementing systems that help prevent
future events that are harmful to more-than-human worlds.
5.4 Reflections on Autobiographical
Explorations of Time in Posthuman
Interaction
Neustaedter and Sengers [ 57] describe ethical issues regarding de-
signs for self-use, specifically questioning if there is an inherent
bias. We were transparent with the study process, and its bound-
aries [ 50], such as the duration, location and motivation, to reduce
the idea of bias and acknowledge the subjective nature of the study.
We thus consider these investigations valuable to expand the design
space for further explorations in the growing subfield of Posthuman
Interaction Design [43] in HCI, and we encourage future research
and explorations in this topic for others and provide our work as a
resource. Autobiographical Design has with additional limitations
related to the generalisation of results [ 57]. However, works such
as these are usually appropriated in unexpected ways, whether the
design process, method combination or artefact. We thus envision
continuing this project by further developing the prototype in a
NordiCHI ’22, October 8–12, 2022, Aarhus, Denmark Ciobanu and Juhlin
less disruptive device but with similar functionalities that would
be installed in people’s homes. Following Bastian’s appeal to liber-
ate clocks [10] and Jörgen Rahm-Skågeby and Lina Rahm’s call to
acknowledge the deep entanglements of materiality and temporal-
ity [73], we envision redesigning the clock into an artefact that is
responsive to the short-term natural changes and accounts for the
various human and nonhuman interconnections.
6 CONCLUSION
This project offers a design-led exploration of how to attune to the
multitude of temporalities within nature and whether this encour-
ages a more unified human-nature mutualism through technology.
In this case, the need to investigate alternatives to the clock-oriented
time perspective in designing interactive systems is important to co-
ordinate ourselves and our designs with environmental changes and
nonhuman needs. Time as a concept is broad, messy and heteroge-
neous. It can relate to both a quantitative measure and an embodied
experience. Thus, to tackle the topic of time, we first looked into
the different understandings of time within human culture as ex-
plored in social science, humanities and HCI in general but also
regarding nature. Then, as a second step, we recounted the diverse
projects that depict the assemblage of time, nature and humans in
new ways. We use these deep dives to support our goal to address
the gap in investigations on time that include more-than-human
temporalities within design-led research. Then, through a process
of Research through Design and Autobiographical Design supple-
mented by a practice of think-aloud walks, we describe the digital
and physical prototype that seeks to support an experience of time
through which human clock time accommodates nature time. We
then report on how we noticed temporal changes in nature with the
support of our prototype. The findings outline the ’struggles’ with
living within two various cultures of time and being torn between
noticing the multitude of temporalities. This, in turn, prompted
a need for adjusting to these new temporalities and more active
engagement as changes in time were perceived differently during
the practice of the think-aloud walks and while using the prototype.
This process revealed how a technology-mediated practice adds
new understandings to the interdependence of human-nonhuman
time compared with the more usual practice of a felt experience
of being in nature. Within such plural time perspectives, there is
potential in designing interactions that facilitate humans to attune
to nature through gradual adjustments. These tools should prompt
an unguided intimate exploration of an ecosystem, growing our
familiarity with the place and the nonhumans living within, and
eventually lead towards structural changes that foster more-than-
human interdependence.
