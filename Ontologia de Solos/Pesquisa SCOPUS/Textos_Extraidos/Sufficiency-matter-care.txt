Grounded theoryABSTRACT
Sufficiency can be understood as the endeavors of economic actors to fulfill needs by delivering only what is 
necessary. This interpretation reveals a relationship between sufficiency and care economics, as both advocate 
for a need-centered economy. This study demonstrates the influence and support of care on the performance of 
sufficiency. It is divided into two parts: (1) the development of a care framework that describes the meanings and 
enablers of care, and (2) the analysis of empirical data from 14 sufficiency-oriented businesses from a care 
perspective using the care framework. The findings indicate that from a care perspective, the world is a network 
of vulnerable and interconnected beings who require individuals to engage in care relationships and activities. 
Time, financial resources, knowledge, collaboration, technologies, and narratives are essential enablers of care 
and, as the findings demonstrate, contribute to the implementation of sufficiency. This study proposes a novel 
narrative of sufficiency as a matter of care and encourages future scholars and practitioners to understand 
sufficiency orientation as part of a care economy —one that fulfils the needs of society over targeting profit 
maximization.
1.Introduction
In the field of sustainability science, there is widespread consensus 
that one essential way of addressing the rising environmental and social 
crises around the world involves the reduction of material and resource 
consumption (Creutzig et al., 2018 ; Wiedmann et al., 2020 ). These 
claims are often combined with the proposal of sufficiency as a prom -
ising concept in this context. Sufficiency demands an absolute reduction 
of production and consumption volumes in affluent societies (Barnthaler 
and Gough, 2023 ; Sandberg, 2021 ) while simultaneously ensuring that 
everyone ’s needs are satisfied (Fuchs et al., 2023 ; Spengler, 2016, 
2018 ).
Sufficiency is often discussed either in terms of individual lifestyle 
choices or as a rather normative and abstract concept (Jungell-Michel -
sson and Heikkurinen, 2022 ). There is less recognition of sufficiency as a 
strategy to design systems of provision, business, and economic practices 
(Jonas et al., 2023 ); the literature on sufficiency-oriented circular 
business models (Beyeler and Jaeger-Erben, 2022 ; Bocken et al., 2022 ; 
Gossen and Niessen, 2024 ; Niessen et al., 2023 ; Niessen and Bocken, 
2021 ) constitutes a rare exception. This gap in research is significant, as 
sufficiency is the most fundamental principle or guideline of economic 
practice: managing the household of a society to balance the available 
resources with what is required to satisfy needs until there is enough —nothing more, nothing less.
This study is part of a larger grounded theory (GT) process investi -
gating the performance of sufficiency in business practices. In a previous 
iteration of this GT process, we observed that a reduction in production 
and consumption volumes occurs when business practitioners orientate 
their actions toward the provision of needs, which necessitates the 
building of careful relationships with the other actors involved in the 
network of production and consumption practices (Beyeler and Jaeger- 
Erben, 2022 ). Sufficiency literature highlights the importance of dis-
tinguishing human needs from superfluous consumer wants or desires 
(Fuchs et al., 2023 ; Jungell-Michelsson and Heikkurinen, 2022 ). In line 
with these findings, we define the performance of sufficiency in business 
as a constant confrontation of the organization with needs, necessitating 
the alignment of business processes with these needs instead of 
animating unnecessary preferences. Questions such as “What are 
needs? ” “How can they be satisfied? ” “How can the business provide 
only for these needs? ” and “How can the business decide when a suffi-
cient level of need satisfaction has been achieved? ” become essential to 
doing business in a sufficiency-oriented context (Beyeler and Jaeger- 
Erben, 2022 ). This definition of the performance of sufficiency is 
closely related to and overlapping with the claims of care economics, 
which places the fulfillment of needs at the center of all economic and 
social actions.

Care economics provides a strong critique of the dominant neoliberal 
economy (Madorin, 2007 ; Winker, 2015 ), pointing to the inability of 
neoliberalism and capitalism to meet human needs, as the provision of 
needs and the reproduction of life do not generate sufficient profits 
(Aulenbacher, 2020 ; Dowling, 2021 ). Neoliberal market capitalism ne-
glects care work, such as health care, education, and child and elderly 
care (Himmelweit, 2007 ). Care is often privatized to fit the capitalist 
mechanism, resulting in the deterioration of the quality of and access to 
care (Dowling, 2018 ; Knobloch, 2013 ; Knobloch and Kleinert, 2022 ). As 
an alternative, the care economy suggests that all human activities, even 
productive ones, must serve and provide for human needs (Winker, 
2015 ); allocating resources and directing production toward the 
fulfillment of needs can help create a society in which caring for a good 
life for all is the central purpose of all economic activity.
Recent studies highlight the positive impact and support of care 
theories in sufficiency and other sustainable practices. A systematic 
literature review on sufficiency indicated that sufficiency is often asso-
ciated with altruistic meanings and performed as an act of care (Jungell- 
Michelsson and Heikkurinen, 2022 ). A study of ethical consumption 
practices, such as boycotting, sharing, and buying second-hand prod-
ucts, argued that care can contribute to combining ethical consumption 
with sufficiency (Karimzadeh and Bostr om, 2023 ). Lage (2022)
emphasized that one of the transformative objectives of sufficiency is to 
place care practices and activities at the center of society. Additional 
studies have combined care ethics with different concepts of sustain -
ability, such as degrowth (Dengler et al., 2022 ; Dengler and Lang, 2022 ; 
Nesterova and Buch-hansen, 2023 ) and circular society (Calisto Friant 
et al., 2023 ; Pla-Juli ˘an and Guevara, 2019 ), thereby deeply rooting 
sustainability in the idea of intra- and intergenerational justice and 
attempting to repair the relationships between many subjects (Jaeger- 
Erben et al., 2025 ). Care ethics, which describes the world as relational, 
interdependent, and vulnerable, therefore, plays a fundamental role in 
socio-ecological transformation (West et al., 2020 ).
While sufficiency demands an orientation toward needs, the oper-
ationalization and implementation of this economic reorientation re-
mains unclear for many practitioners and scholars. Nevertheless, care 
practitioners have been constantly interacting with needs, developing 
and putting care ethics into practice for several decades (see e.g., Mol, 
2008 ; Mol et al., 2010 ; Tronto, 1993 ). People have always cared, and 
entire research fields are dedicated to theorizing the practices of care. As 
care and sufficiency orient activities around the fulfillment of needs, and 
since the performance of care in practice is well documented, this study 
utilizes the knowledge from care theories to better understand the per-
formance of sufficiency. While human needs are central to both care and 
sufficiency, their theoretical definition and identification is not 
addressed in this study. However, our understanding of human needs 
refers to Gough (2015, 2020, 2023) , who combined needs theory with 
sufficiency and consumption corridors. Additionally, our study presents 
a multidimensional understanding of needs, drawing on care ethics and 
science and technology studies (STS), which recognize that not only 
humans, but also other living beings —as well as non-living entities such 
as materials and technologies —can be understood to have needs (Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2017 ).
First, in order to explore care as a theory, we summarize care and 
practices of care based on the existing literature, with the aim of 
developing a care framework for sufficiency scholars and practitioners. 
Building on this theory, we empirically investigate how care material -
izes in sufficiency practices and how it enables the performance of suf-
ficiency in business practices. To this end, we examine the presence of 
care in sufficiency business practices by re-analyzing existing empirical 
data from 14 sufficiency-oriented businesses from our previous GT 
iteration, using the care framework developed in our literature analysis.
Subsequently, we first present the research design and methodology 
of the paper, which is followed by the description of the care framework 
involving the meanings and enablers of care (Section 3.1). In a second 
part, the findings describe how the meanings and enablers of care influence and shape the performance of sufficiency in business practices 
(Section 3.2). Finally, we discuss the limitations and implications of 
combining sufficiency and care for future research and practice (Section 
4).
2.Methods
2.1. Grounded theory approach
The grounded theory (GT) approach (Corbin and Strauss, 1990 ) 
adopted in this paper generates theoretical insights from the empirical 
ground by observing the unfolding of social reality (Breuer, 2010 ). 
Characterized by an iterative and cyclical approach (Strübing, 2013 ) 
and by the process of constant comparison, patterns and heuristics that 
emerge from the data are further assessed for heterogeneity or homo -
geneity with newly selected data until theoretical saturation is attained 
(Corbin and Strauss, 1990 ).
We do not present a finished GT process; rather, we include two 
cycles of iteration within a larger, ongoing GT research project. The 
larger GT project aims to deconstruct and reconstruct the phenomenon 
of sufficiency by exploring the realities, challenges, and possibilities 
with which different business practitioners experiment while oper-
ationalizing sufficiency. Different iterations of the larger GT are illus-
trated in Fig. 1and described in further detail in Table 1. The larger GT 
project began in early 2021 with a dive into the existing sufficiency 
literature (Iteration 1). The second iteration (Iteration 2), published 
elsewhere (Beyeler and Jaeger-Erben, 2022 ), consisted of an empirical 
analysis of businesses implementing and experimenting with 
sufficiency-oriented strategies. One of the main results of the second 
iteration was the hypothesis that care is an essential characteristic of 
sufficiency, which supports the implementation of sufficiency in prac-
tice. However, Iteration 2 did not consider how care influences suffi-
ciency and its implementation in business practices, necessitating two 
follow-up iterations (Iterations 3 and 4 in this study). Iteration 3 delved 
into care literature, and Iteration 4 reanalyzed the empirical data from 
Iteration 2 from a care perspective. The methods employed in these two 
iterations are described below.
While empirical observations are necessary to develop theoretical 
insights in GT, theoretical data from existing literature can be useful in 
Fig. 1.Illustration of the grounded theory process in which this paper is 
included; Iterations 3 and 4 are covered in this publication (own representation).L. Beyeler and M. Jaeger-Erben                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ecological  Economics  238 (2025)  108737

later iterations to contextualize and validate previously discovered hy-
potheses (Bryant and Charmaz, 2007 ; Cardoso Ermel et al., 2021 ). GT 
scholars often encourage researchers to return to previous data and it-
erations (Hensel and Glinka, 2018 ). The logic of discovery and valida -
tion, as well as the nonlinear and iterative nature of GT (Bryant and 
Charmaz, 2007 ), help validate and reinterpret earlier observations and 
discoveries. Thus, our empirical data on sufficiency-oriented business 
can be reanalyzed with the insights of a new theoretical strand. Care 
theories have rarely been combined with sufficiency research in this 
manner.
2.2. Theory grounded in literature
The first part of our analysis (Iteration 3) began with a dive into care 
literature, to synthesize the concept of care for sufficiency scholars. In 
line with GT approaches, this study treated care literature as empirical 
data for the development of a care framework (Cardoso Ermel et al., 
2021 ). Our grounded-in-literature approach did not aim to systemati -
cally review all the existing care literature. We started with a broad 
search of care literature using care-related keywords across databases 
such as JSTOR, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and WorldCat. We also 
used the snowballing technique with known reviews and books. This 
initial phase revealed two patterns: 1) certain studies were frequently 
cited and appeared foundational to care literature, and 2) while care 
ethics first conceptualized care, other fields extended it with discipline- 
specific emphases. Thus, we identified five research fields —care eco-
nomics, ethics of care, ecofeminism, STS, and geographies of care—each 
building on its own foundational literature. Through forward and 
backward snowballing using these foundational texts, we refined our 
sample until we reached theoretical sampling (Barnett-Page and 
Thomas, 2009 ). The selected literature either introduced, extended, or 
analyzed key aspects of the care concept. Table 1in the Appendix details 
the literature included in the review.
To develop the care framework, the collected literature was induc -
tively coded according to the different stages highlighted by Corbin and 
Strauss (1990) : open, axial, and selective coding using the MAXQDA 
software. In this explorative literature analysis, we considered the 
meanings and enablers of care in practices as relevant theoretical cate-
gories to describe what care is and how it is performed in practice. The 
meanings and enablers of care are not only relevant for care practices 
but also as categories that may be found in sufficiency-oriented business 
practices. These emerging themes appeared due to our interpretation of 
the social from the perspective of social practice theory.
We understand the social practice to be the smallest entity of social 
action (Reckwitz, 2002 ; Schatzki, 2002 ). In social practices, individuals 
are embedded and interact with different material artefacts 
(Hillebrandt, 2014 ). Social meanings, such as symbols, values, norms, 
and orientations, and other resources such as skills, knowledge, and time, lend meaning to the interactions between the bodies and the 
artefact and help the activities unfold (ibid.). The meanings and ena-
blers —elements of social practices —used in this study can be defined as 
follows: 
 Social meanings : These elements, such as norms, values, orienta -
tion, and narratives, contribute meaning to the performance and 
activities of practices (Shove et al., 2012 ). Social meanings provide 
context and sense to the actions and often orient the activities toward 
one or multiple common ends, such as a sufficiency orientation and 
the fulfillment of needs (Schatzki, 2002 ).
 Enablers: These elements are necessary for the performance of 
practices —for example, materials, competencies, time, and space 
(Shove et al., 2012 ). They enable the performance and connection of 
practices. Their absence may either reduce the quality of the per-
formance or entirely hinder practices from taking place (Hui et al., 
2016 ).
2.3. Case study selection and data collection
In the second phase, the new insights from the care literature review 
were used in a deductive manner for a secondary analysis of existing 
empirical data from sufficiency-oriented businesses (collected in Itera-
tion 2). The aim of this deductive analysis was to observe how care is 
impacting and enabling the performance of sufficiency. The empirical 
data consisted of primary and secondary data from 14 sufficiency- 
oriented businesses in the fashion and electronics sectors, collected in 
2021 and 2022. Businesses implementing sufficiency-oriented strategies 
and publicly communicating sufficiency and reduction purposes were 
selected based on theoretical sampling (Strübing, 2013 ). In summary, 
the businesses had to satisfy the following criteria: 
 Lessening strategies: Businesses implementing sufficiency-oriented 
strategies in their practices were identified according to the 
following four “lessening strategies ” of Schneidewind and Palzkill- 
Vorbeck (2011) : decelerating (less clutter), decluttering (less 
speed), disentangling (less distance), and decommercializing (less 
market).
 Sufficiency purpose: A scan of the businesses ’ websites, official sus-
tainability reports, publicly available articles, and interviews in the 
media was performed to control for the sufficiency-oriented purpose 
of the business cases —for example, aiming at the reduction of con-
sumption or production volumes.
 Fashion and electronic sectors: B2C businesses from both the fashion 
and electronic sectors, having a sufficiency orientation and applying 
sufficiency strategies (such as long-lasting product design and repair 
and reuse possibilities), were selected. Both sectors were selected 
because both sectors implemented similar sufficiency strategies. Table 1

Hence, a comparison between the sectors was possible. As both 
sectors have significant negative environmental and social impacts 
(IRP, 2019 ; Niinim aki et al., 2020 ), practices of sufficiency are ur-
gently required (Creutzig et al., 2022 ).
One interview per case was conducted with founders or employees 
holding strategic responsibilities (n 9). In cases where founders were 
unavailable for an interview, public podcasts with them were used as 
primary data (n 5). The podcasts were comparable to personal in-
terviews, as they were chosen to align with the problem-centered 
interview guideline. The guideline, available in Table 2in the Appen -
dix, focused on the daily practices of the businesses along their entire 
supply chain, from the acquisition of resources to the consumption of 
goods or services, to end-of-life services. To complete and validate the 
data from the interviews, secondary data from websites, newsletters, 
blog posts, Ted talks, and sustainability reports was collected. For this 
study, some new data from recent podcasts, newsletters, and blog posts 
from the cases was added, highlighting the recent developments since 
the data collection in 2021 and 2022.1Table 3in the Appendix details 
the 14 sufficiency-oriented businesses from the sample.
We analyzed the empirical data using the care framework developed 
based on the literature using a deductive process (see Section 3.1), 
following the axial and selective coding process of Corbin and Strauss 
(1990) . The objective was to understand how the meaning of care was 
represented in the practices of sufficiency-oriented businesses as well as 
how care enablers supported practices of sufficiency. The realization of 
typical business activities such as resource acquisition, production or 
design, consumption support and consumer relationships, stakeholder 
relationship, end-of-life practices, as well as internal governance and 
work practices were observed for the analysis of care and sufficiency in 
the context of sufficiency-oriented businesses.3.Results
The findings first provide the results from the literature review, 
summarizing the meanings and enablers of care identified in the care 
literature (Sections 3.1). The second part of the findings (Sections 3.2) 
describes how the meanings and enablers of care influence the practices 
of sufficiency-oriented businesses, with insights on how care can support 
the performance of sufficiency.
3.1. Care framework
The care framework is the result of our literature review. It sum-
marizes the common ground of care literature and is divided in two 
dimensions that represent the essence of all care theories: the meanings 
of care and the enablers of care practices.
3.1.1. Meanings of care
While the care literature is diverse and has a variety of different 
focuses and applications, there is consensus across the literature on a few 
fundamental aspects of care. These aspects are present in all the studies 
reviewed for this research and lend meaning to the concept of care. The 
meanings of care can be summarized into the following four aspects: 
 The vulnerable and dependent conditions of life
 The orientation toward needs
 The relationality of care
 The omnipresence of care
Care ethics highlights that the core inquiry of care theories involves 
the understanding and describing of the condition or nature of human 
beings (Lynch et al., 2021 ; Mol, 2008 ; Tronto, 1993 ). Care scholars 
describe humans as vulnerable and dependent beings (Lynch, 2009 ; 
Plonz, 2011 ; Tronto, 1993 ). Thus, they refute the ideal assumption that 
humans are solely rational, autonomous, and self-responsible beings 
(Petit, 2014 ). Instead, they acknowledge the diverse range of human 
experiences, from vulnerability and dependency to periods of autonomy, 
revealing the multiple and varied interdependencies present throughout Table 2 
Description of enablers of care practices identified in the literature review.
Enabler of care 
practicesDescription
TimeTime is required to carry out the care activities. For example, time is necessary in coordinating activities and people (Kohlen, 2018 ) and in waiting for the 
outcomes of interventions (Mol, 2008 ; Sevenhuijsen, 2018 ). Popke (2006) also highlighted that care practices have different spatial dimensions and various 
temporal rhythms. For example, it is difficult to impose one single productive and efficiency-driven temporality on all care practices (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2015 ). Cook and Trundle (2020) acknowledged the transformative aspect of care over time —e.g., over an individual ’s lifetime —as well as the long-term 
engagement required by care relationships, highlighting the amount of time that each care activity and relationship requires to achieve its goals.
Financial resourcesFinancial resources are essential to support and enable care activities —e.g., paying for labor or technological interventions. Due to the relational nature of 
care, costs cannot be reduced without a significant loss of quality of care or a deterioration in working conditions (Himmelweit, 2007 ). One measure called 
for by care economists to revalue care is a significant increase in financial resources and investment in care practices (Winker, 2015 ).
KnowledgeKnowledge is a fundamental resource for care practices. These practices require information about the subjects of care, their needs, and the processes to be 
performed (Mol, 2008 ). Care practices generate knowledge that provide essential insights for improvements (Moriggi et al., 2020 ). However, theoretical 
knowledge must be understood in the context of the care practices. Mol (2008) criticized health care processes in which facts are blindly applied, suggesting 
that good care requires a thoughtful process of translating scientific knowledge into practice. 
Knowledge also includes the learning and application of essential skills and know-how for the delivery of care. Indications of useful skills for a good care 
process can be found in care literature (Conradi, 2015 ; Knobloch, 2019 ; Mol, 2008 ; Senghaas-Knobloch, 2008 ). For example, care relies on communication, 
creativity, emotional support, tenacity, adaptability to and acceptance of uncertainty, the ability to stay calm, and perseverance. Sevenhuijsen (2018) wrote 
about the importance of affection in care work. The list is not exhaustive, nor are all the skills always necessary to perform care activities. However, they are 
important features of care practices and serve care activities in many different settings.
TechnologiesTechnologies support care practices and can be useful tools for meeting needs. Similar to knowledge, technologies are not neutral tools. They can intervene 
in bodies, nature, and ecosystems in unpredictable ways (Mol, 2008 ). The use of technologies requires attention to its effects and outcomes (ibid.).
CollaborationCare is a teamwork (Mol, 2008 ). The subjects involved in care relationships depend on mutual support to achieve their goals (Folbre, 2008 ; Knobloch, 2013 ). 
Many scholars have highlighted the importance of solidarity and collaboration between care parties (Conradi, 2015 ; Folbre, 2008 ; Knobloch, 2013, 2019 ; 
Winker, 2015 ). The needs of many different care subjects are best met when everyone has equal voice and is involved in the process (Dombroski et al., 2019 ; 
Tronto, 1993 ; Winker, 2015 ).
NarrativesCare practices are shaped by the discourses and narratives surrounding care (Harcourt, 2019 ; Mol et al., 2010 ). In an anthropocentric narrative, care 
relationships are limited and centered on human beings. The language used creates boundaries for thinking about or considering the more-than-human 
world and its needs (Mol et al., 2010 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). Experimenting with new languages can help describe the complex dynamics of care and 
overcome the limitations created by language that is taken for granted (Mol et al., 2010 ).

Fulfillment of needsSufficiency in business practices prioritize goods and services that fulfill 
needs instead simulating unnecessary consumer wants for profit

human life (Keller and Kittay, 2017 ). Some stages of human life are more 
vulnerable than others —for example, the newborn and the elderly 
(ibid.). These stages of life require more care and attention than other, 
more autonomous phases. However, even in periods of greater auton -
omy, people are never free from care activities (Madorin, 2007 ). As 
caregivers, humans reinitiate a form of dependency and reciprocity with 
other, more vulnerable beings (Knobloch, 2013 ). Thus, by clarifying the 
vulnerability of human beings, care literature critiques the currently 
dominant economic systems, which build upon the assumption of a 
rational and solely autonomous homo economicus and regard vulnera -
bility, dependency, and needs as weaknesses (Aulenbacher, 2020 ; 
Tronto, 1993 ). Due to the condition of vulnerability in life, care prac-
tices are particularly characterized by the purpose of needs fulfillment. 
Vulnerable beings have needs that must be met in order to ensure not 
only survival but also a good quality of life. The fulfillment of needs, in 
all their forms and diversity, is, thus, the goal of all care work (Mol, 
2008 ; Tronto, 1993 ).
To fulfill their needs, vulnerable and dependent beings must build 
relationships with others (Gubitzer and Mader, 2011 ; Hofmeister et al., 
2019 ). Thus, care is, at its core, a relational concept, and all actions 
related to care require relationships. According to Kawamura (2013) , 
every activity that humans perform involves relationships with others, 
as they never work alone (ibid.). An important difference among the 
fields of care research lies in the agency of care, namely the question of 
who the subject of care is. When care practices are human centered, 
which is often the case in care economics, they are shaped around 
human needs, bodies, and activities (Baumann et al., 2013 ; Eisler, 2013 ; 
Schmitt et al., 2018 ). For ecofeminist and STS scholars, nature is an 
important subject of care, having its own needs and vulnerabilities while 
also providing essential resources for life to all living beings. Thus, care 
relationships and interdependencies are extended to all species and 
living beings (and even beyond life) and do not stop at homo sapiens (see 
e.g., Bauhardt, 2012 ; Bauhardt and Harcourt, 2019 ; Dengler, 2022 ; 
Hofmeister et al., 2019 ). STS scholars abandon anthropocentric views of 
care and describe the interdependencies between all living and non- 
living entities, extending the agency of care to the material world, 
such as products and technologies (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). Geog -
raphies of care advocate for care relationships that transcend the di-
mensions of space and time. Not only agents in geographical proximity 
but also subjects living in more distant places (Gibson-Graham et al., 
2019 ) and those from future generations (Petit, 2014 ; Popke, 2006 ) are 
deemed worthy of care. For example, Raghuram (2016) argued for a 
decolonial approach to care, locating care ethics beyond the Global 
North and its west-centric views. Thus, care practices unfold between 
humans, between humans and nature, and between all living and non- 
living beings, across space and time (Conradi, 2015 ; Hofmeister et al., 
2019 ). Some scholars describe the care and relationships that unfold 
between all different forms of living and non-living beings as kinship 
(Desai and Smith, 2018 ).
Care relationships are inherently asymmetrical and subject to power 
imbalances and abuse (Conradi, 2015 ; Jochimsen, 2019 ; Razavi, 2012 ). 
According to Jochimsen (2003) , an inequality in the distribution of re-
sources, care responsibilities, and emotional involvement, as well as 
individuals ’ different abilities to engage in care activities, can create 
dependencies and asymmetries in care relationships. Care economists 
further highlight inequalities in access to care (Aulenbacher et al., 
2018a ). For example, studies conducted in the United Kingdom and in 
the United States have demonstrated that Black, Asian, and other minority ethnic groups faced higher risks of serious illness and early 
death from COVID-19 due to systemic and discriminatory factors such as 
economic insecurity and lack of access to health insurance (Platt and 
Warwick, 2020 ; Raifman and Raifman, 2020 ). At the same time, those 
with the least access to care services are the ones who provide the most 
care (D’Alessandro, 2022 ; Dowling, 2021 ). For example, time-use ana-
lyses have indicated that the time for unpaid care work is unequally 
distributed across genders and systematically performed by women 
(Bauhardt, 2019 ; Harcourt and Bauhardt, 2019 ; Ruby and Scholz, 
2018 ). For these reasons, care scholars advocate for structures, frame -
works, and policies that consider the asymmetries of care and protect 
vulnerable people and communities from the abuse of power and 
injustice (Jochimsen, 2019 ; Tronto, 1993 ). The relationality of care, 
thus, goes hand in hand with a consideration of the dependencies and 
asymmetries of the relationships and corresponding action.
Finally, the last meaning of care identified in the literature is that 
care is always present (Martin et al., 2015 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). 
Merely existing in this world requires care (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ; 
Tronto, 1993 ). According to Puig de la Bellacasa (2017) , an obligation to 
care emerges from material and affective constraints in everyday life, 
such as the limited material resources on a finite planet and the inability 
of newly born babies to survive on their own. Although there is no moral 
obligation to care, the constraints make care a condition of life that is 
always present (ibid.). Therefore, care is an ongoing process, although 
the work involved may be unattractive and unpleasant (Cook and 
Trundle, 2020 ; Mol, 2008 ; Murphy, 2015 ). Moreover, individuals face 
an excessive number of limitations and vulnerabilities on their own to be 
able to care for their needs themselves (Jochimsen, 2019 ; Kohlen, 2018 ), 
making engagement in care relationships inevitable. Scholars have 
observed that while care is omnipresent, it is not possible to care for 
everything and everyone all the time (Himmelweit, 2007 ; Mol, 2008 ). 
The intentional severing of relationships to make room for other re-
lationships better equipped to meet needs is also pertinent (Pitt, 2018 ; 
Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). An end to caregiving may be appropriated 
when certain needs are met or when the relationships or activities no 
longer serve needs (ibid.). These four aspects can be described as the 
fundamental characteristics of care that lend meaning to the concept of 
care and especially help scholars, practitioners, policy makers, and 
various other actors understand its foundations.

3.1.2. Care enablers
While the meanings of care described here can be understood as the 
defining aspects of the concept of care, enabling an understanding of its 
application across research fields and practice, care has another char-
acteristic that is described in all the literature reviewed in this study: 
care always leads to action (Tronto, 1993 ). Needs are met by engaging 
not only in relationships but also in activities, referred to as care work in 
the literature (Knobloch and Kleinert, 2022 ). Moriggi et al. (2020)
described the materialization of care in different spaces and times 
through interactions, activities, and concrete practices, all of which are 
directed toward the same objective of fulfilling needs (Harcourt and 
Bauhardt, 2019 ). Fig. 2illustrates how the meanings of care permeate all 
care practices, in the manner of an atmosphere or a logic enveloping the 
practices. The enablers can be found in each care practice as material or 
immaterial aspects that allow care activities to be performed, and the 
needs realized. With these two dimensions of the meanings and enablers 
of care, Fig. 2presents a care framework that summarizes the most 
relevant aspects of care from the literature, which can be used to identify 
care in other practices, such as in sufficiency practices.
The performance of care practices requires a variety of agents, ma-
terials, competences, and meanings (Hui et al., 2016 ; Shove et al., 2012 ). 
Care scholars in the reviewed literature have described numerous 
different elements that enable the performance of care practices. Table 2
highlights some enablers of care practices that have been identified in 
the literature as relevant to the performance of care: time, knowledge, 
financial resources, collaboration, technologies, and narratives. The 
importance of these enablers becomes relevant on thinking about the 
absence of these elements from the care practices. Scholars have equated 
the absence of these enablers to a neglect of care (Mol, 2008 ; Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2015, 2017 ). For example, a lack of financial resources or 
time impedes the quality of care activities and their ability to fulfill 
needs. According to care scholars, a care economy can strengthen the 
presence of these enablers in all economic and social practices such that 
they continuously support the realization of needs (Winker, 2015 ).
3.2. Sufficiency as a matter of care
The following sections present the findings from the empirical parts 
of the study. First, the findings describe how the meanings of care 
materialize in sufficiency-oriented business practices. Second, the ef-
fects of the care enablers on sufficiency in business practices are 
described. As mentioned in Section 2.1, these findings rely on empirical 
material from a previous iteration within our larger GT project (see 
Beyeler and Jaeger-Erben, 2022 ).
3.2.1. Meanings of care influencing sufficiency
The analysis of sufficiency in business practices from a care 
perspective revealed that all the meanings of care identified in the 
literature are present in the empirical data, although different intensities 
or frequencies are visible across the cases. Table 3summarizes how the 
meanings of care materialize in the empirical data.
The omnipresence of care, or the fact that care does not disappear 
even if care work is ignored, is relevant for all the cases, as it causes 
sufficiency practitioners to engage in sufficiency. Sufficiency practi -
tioners feel an obligation to repair or transform economic and ecological 
systems, to sustain life on Earth. Although the practitioners do not 
explicitly designate the lack of care as the source of their sufficiency 
orientation, the reasons they name always describe a neglect. For 
example, one interviewee questioned the quest for endless growth on a 
planet with finite natural resources: “We are not in a limitless environ -
ment, like in terms of resources. At some point, they won ’t be any more. 
So, better to start using what we don’t need anymore, recycle it, refur-
bish it or any other re-use options ” (personal interview with an anony -
mous outdoor brand, September 2021). Thus, their sufficiency practices 
emerged from the current neglect and ignorance of planetary 
boundaries.While they do not explicitly challenge the image of homo econom -
icus, some sufficiency practitioners have recognized the vulnerability of 
individuals in their ecosystems and develop strategies to support their 
needs. For example, they have addressed the struggle of the environ -
ment in recovering from pollution; the needs of workers in global supply 
chains, who are unable to earn a living wage; and the issues faced by 
consumers with limited purchasing power for sustainable options. For 
example, Fairphone promotes fair working conditions in material 
extraction (Fairphone, 2021 ), and Hopaal offered a long-lasting and 
minimalistic white T-shirt for an affordable price of €24. These actions 
to support, repair, and include the vulnerabilities and neglected needs of 
different groups or ecosystems reflect an attentiveness to life that goes 
beyond viewing humans as purely rational and autonomous beings.
The objective of aligning production and consumption with needs is 
evident in the empirical data, as noted in our previous study (Beyeler 
and Jaeger-Erben, 2022 ), and spread across all cases. Sufficiency- 
oriented businesses often engage in dialogs with consumers to identify 
needs —for example, determining which piece of clothing consumers 
need and what functions the piece must serve: “It is the people! They 
thought the sock, they thought the t-shirt, or any other product. So, we 
know that the product is answering a real need ” (Hopaal, publicly 
available podcast from 2020, author ’s translation). Sufficiency-oriented 
businesses also address post-purchase needs, maintaining relationships 
with consumers to respond to new needs that emerge during the prod-
uct’s use phase. The needs of materials and products are equally 
important. Sufficiency practitioners focus on a product ’s entire lifecycle, 
treating the product as an agent of care. They address the changing 
needs of materials, such as preventing defects, repairing, maintaining, 
and ensuring long-lasting use. From sourcing to production, repair, 
reuse, and end-of-life management, these practices reflect a commit -
ment to meeting both consumer and material needs.
All the cases demonstrate that sufficiency, akin to care, is imple -
mented in relationship with others, especially the internal relationship 
with employees, founders, and managers, the external relationship with 
stakeholders, and beyond-human relationship with materials in the form 
of resources or products. All of these relationships are important for 
sufficiency-driven businesses. Internal relationships consist of mutual 
support for daily work, including exchanges pertaining to creativity, 
problem-solving, strategic direction, decision-making, and motivation. 
The founders of Loom and Hopaal and the CEOs of Patagonia and 
VAUDE explained in the interviews how they cultivate a culture that 
favors well-being and happiness at work and allows employees to have 
time for caring activities outside the business: “We are all about ‘less but 
better ’ […]. We go home early, we like to be lazy, and we like to spend 
time not working. […] We want that our employees have time to do 
their groceries, to take care of their children without having to delegate 
their own care work ” (personal interview with Loom, June 2021, au-
thor’s translation). Trustful and purposeful relationships with external 
stakeholders, such as suppliers are a fundamental part of sufficiency 
practices. Sufficiency practitioners carefully select their partners —for 
example, by finding within a local perimeter suppliers who are willing to 
work with sustainable materials and who adhere to high social and 
transparency standards. Additionally, sufficiency practitioners develop 
a caring relationship with the materials that are used to develop a 
product or those that are used in services, such as repair. Materials are 
not merely used to develop products and sell them. Resources, tech-
nologies, designs, and transformation processes are carefully chosen to 
enable the products and materials to be used, reused, and repaired. The 
goal is to enable material and products to persist over time, and avoid 
products to be forgotten in basements or storage rooms (Eimterb aumer 
and Jaeger-Erben, 2025 ). This tendency is illustrated by the list of 
different sustainable materials tested and used by the producing com-
panies in this study, including recycled materials, upcycled waste, 
ethically sourced minerals, and natural resources that are low in energy 
and water consumption and locally sourced. The relationality with the 
material world is an example of the extension of attention to needs, L. Beyeler and M. Jaeger-Erben                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ecological  Economics  238 (2025)  108737

vulnerabilities, and interdependencies beyond humans, which is an 
essential contribution of STS to the care literature (see, e.g., Atkinson- 
Graham et al., 2015 ; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ).
3.2.2. Care enablers in sufficiency practices
This section outlines how the care enablers from our care framework 
affect or support sufficiency in business practices. Time, financial re-
sources, and knowledge are revealed to be essential for sufficiency 
practices, since an absence of these elements jeopardizes the existence of 
sufficiency-driven businesses. Additionally, collaboration is the linking 
element derived from the relationality of sufficiency. Implementing 
sufficiency in relationship with others drives collaboration, builds soli-
darity, and creates communities instead of encouraging competition. 
Narratives of care and supportive technologies have not been clearly 
observed as enablers of sufficiency practices. Narratives and statements 
concerning the orientation toward needs are present, as needs are cen-
tral to sufficiency. However, the fact that sufficiency is a matter of care is 
not explicit in the conversation and communication of the cases. In 
sufficiency practices, the technological focus is on building modular, 
repairable, and long-lasting products. However, it is unclear how tech-
nologies beyond reparability and modularity may be helpful for suffi-
ciency practitioners. In the following paragraphs, we describe how time, 
financial resources, and knowledge shape sufficiency practices. All care 
enablers and their influence on sufficiency practices are summarized in 
Table 4.3.2.2.1. Time. Care scholars emphasize that care activities and the 
development of care relationships take time and that this time cannot be 
reduced for the sake of increasing productivity (Madorin, 2007 ). While 
profit orientation suppresses unproductive working time, care creates 
time for inefficient but necessary life-sustaining caring activities (Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2015 ); so does sufficiency. In the process of developing 
products and services for the realization of needs, time is required to 
build and maintain relationships and to adapt sufficiency activities such 
that needs are met with the least possible consumption of resources, 
energy, and materials. Time is essential for sufficiency, as care re-
lationships require consistency and frequent exchange and as the 
duration of some sufficiency activities is non-negotiable.
The high frequency of exchange between businesses and their con-
sumers is time-consuming in sufficiency-oriented businesses. Instead of 
one moment of purchase and a little contact afterward, sufficiency- 
oriented business practices rely on frequent contact with consumers 
before and after the purchase. For example, the co-creative production 
and pre-order process of companies such as Hopaal and Shiftphone 
consists of the following touchpoints: consumer involvement in product 
design, pre-orders to limit production volumes, product delivery, and 
multiple feedback exchanges during and after the use phase. This fre-
quency of exchange is ineffective in a profit-maximizing context but 
necessary in sufficiency practices to ensure the long-term satisfaction of 
needs.
Sufficiency practitioners insist that the longer duration of some of

Overview of the materialization of care enablers in the empirical data on sufficiency-oriented businesses.
Care enabler Care enablers required for sufficiency practices Examples of how care enablers support sufficiency in practices
Time Sufficiency, similar to care, requires time for inefficient but necessary life- 
sustaining activities. The time needed to develop and maintain relationships 
and to orient, adapt, and perform sufficiency activities cannot be reduced.Frequency: Consistent and frequent exchange with stakeholders is essential. 
Duration : Time reduction is not possible in some sufficiency practices without 
losing significant quality or missing the goal of the practice. 
Time limit: It is necessary to accept the end of some practices —e.g., if needs are 
fulfilled or relationships are not working out.
Financial 
resourcesEven if sufficiency practices generate less revenue than conventional 
businesses, financial means are essential to support their activities. As in the 
case of care practices, money is necessary —e.g., to pay employees, invest in 
infrastructures and technologies, and to conduct their activities.Cross-financing: Sufficiency practices that generate profits are used to support 
other activities with no or low revenues. These practices are not discarded 
simply due to lower rentability. They are sustained, as they are necessary for the 
fulfillment of needs. 
Lack of liquidity: Some cases ceased operations due to financial constraints. 
For example, higher costs made repair and reuse uncompetitive with fast 
fashion, despite their essential role in reducing consumption. Without financial 
support, sufficiency practices struggle to persist.
Knowledge Sufficiency practices, akin to care activities, rely on knowledge production, 
capture, and transmission in order to sustain.Transfer of knowledge between businesses and consumers: It is necessary 
to teach consumers how to take care of products, to enable long-lasting use. 
Scientific knowledge supporting sufficiency: Scientific facts or reports from 
civil society help sufficiency practitioners demonstrate the need for sufficiency 
practices. The knowledge gathered from outside the business is a valuable tool 
to develop alternatives to capitalist practices. 
Creation and sharing of knowledge from sufficiency practices: By testing, 
improving, and spreading new practices, sufficiency practitioners create their 
own new knowledge and skills that are then shared with others in order to 
diffuse sufficiency.
Collaboration Collaboration characterizes the care relationships mentioned above (Section 
3.1). Sufficiency practitioners engage in collaborative and supportive 
relationships with others and often resist competition.Vocabulary used to describe and value collaboration: Some words used 
include solidarity, friendship, open-source knowledge (sharing with others/not 
hiding), mutual support, and teamwork.
Narratives A narrative of care, which links sufficiency to the meanings of care, is not 
explicit in the data. However, the fulfillment of needs and the necessity to care 
for people and the planet is part of their communication.Narratives or statements of businesses that connect sufficiency with care:   
 Official statements emphasize that the business cares for people and the 
planet.
 Needs orientation entails the identification and naming of needs and 
questioning of consumers ’ desires, if they do not correspond to needs.
Framing sufficiency as a matter of care is not an explicit narrative 
observed in the data.
Technologies The input and outcome of using technologies to support the performance of 
sufficiency remains unclear in the data.Forms of technological support observed in the data: The development of 
modular, repairable, and long-lasting products is encouraged. 
Not observed in the data: The use of technologies beyond modularity and 
reparability, to support sufficiency and the fulfillment of needs —e.g., with low- 
tech—is not observed.L. Beyeler and M. Jaeger-Erben                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ecological  Economics  238 (2025)  108737

practices is essential and that time reduction is impossible. They argue 
that they must take the time that they need to produce high-quality, 
long-lasting products or to improve their sharing or repair facilities, 
even if it requires, for example, multiple costly testing loops to ensure 
the quality of a garment. Consumers are used to waiting for their 
products to be designed and produced, and suppliers are welcome to 
prioritize quality over time pressure. The repair atelier Bis es mir vom 
Leibe fallt invested valuable time in consultations with consumers to 
understand their needs, issues with products, and the vulnerabilities of 
the material. Such consultations were crucial in avoiding mistakes and 
successfully fulfilling the needs of the consumers and the product.
Finally, another aspect of time that is relevant to sufficiency practices 
is the acceptance of or planning for an ending of activities. An activity, a 
strategy, or the business itself may become obsolete once needs are 
successfully met. For example, more sales of a product can only lead to 
superfluous consumption. IFixit, for example, thinks about the moment 
in the future when they will have sold enough screwdrivers and repair 
tools to the European population, such that more sales would not 
necessarily lead to more repairs. Hopaal reflected on the number and 
diversity of the products they had. In 2023, they estimated that their 
collections were no longer responding to consumer needs but were 
following superfluous consumer desires. They decided to discontinue all 
their collections and focus on a few multifunctional and long-lasting 
outdoor products (Hopaal, 2024 ). Although care is ongoing, some ac-
tivities are temporary. Care is not only about developing connections to 
meet needs but also about consciously disengaging when the care ac-
tivities are no longer realizing needs or when the purpose of meeting 
needs is doing more harm than good for the common good (Pitt, 2018 ; 
Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ).
3.2.2.2. Financial resources. Sufficiency practices depend on financial 
resources. Sufficiency-oriented activities generate less revenue than 
conventional businesses, for instance, because they are labor intensive, 
because supply chains need to be reinvented, or because the relation -
ships that underlie all sufficiency activities require time, commitment, 
and energy (Himmelweit, 2007 ). For example, iFixit does not receive 
any revenue for its participation in repair roundtables and other 
activism activities. Moreover, care practices in sufficiency-oriented 
businesses have less potential for productivity gains and cost re-
ductions, which may worsen the health of workers or the quality of the 
material used as well as negatively impact nature. With inferior revenue 
streams and less acceptance for cost efficiency, sufficiency-oriented 
businesses are looking for creative and sustainable sources of income 
that are not tied to growth imperatives and productivity logics and that 
can finance and secure their activities.
The data reveals a variety of financial flows circulating through and 
enabling different sufficiency practices. There are sufficiency practices 
that generate high revenues, for example, by selling goods and providing 
services. These lucrative practices serve as funding sources for other 
practices. Cross-financing is an important strategy for sufficiency- 
oriented businesses to transfer their practices (Beyeler and Jaeger- 
Erben, 2022 ). All sufficiency-oriented businesses in the study depend 
on external funding without expectations of returns from foundations, 
government funds, crowdfunded investments, and private investments. 
Thus, financial resources flow from external sources to the businesses, 
flourish within some practices, and are (re)invested in other low- 
revenue practices, within or outside the businesses. For example, the 
founder of the repair atelier Bis es mir vom Leib Fallt started the repair 
atelier with the income from their sustainable design label. As repair 
also requires education, the repair team established an educational as-
sociation with the help of external income from foundations, govern -
ment funds, and donations. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the high cost of repair compared to the prices of fast 
fashion, both the design label and repair atelier had to be closed (Bis es 
mir vom Leibe fallt, 2023 ). Since the data collection phase, three of the 
cases had to close due to financial constraints. Sufficiency and care 
practices cannot exist without financial resources to cover their costs. 
Sufficiency practitioners have expressed that financial resources must 
not go only to businesses and practices that are profitable; rather, 
practices without significant revenues are worthy of funding if they 
fulfill unmet needs.
3.2.2.3. Knowledge. Almost all sufficiency practitioners in the study 
utilize diverse media and channels to communicate relevant information 
and facts. Sufficiency practices in the study rely on knowledge produc -
tion, capture, and transmission to sustain. For example, to support a 
long-lasting use, many communications between businesses and con-
sumers include tips for the washing of clothes, instructions for main -
taining the color of fabrics, or detailed instructions for repairing 
electronic devices. While some sufficiency practitioners use online 
channels such as blogs or regular newsletters, others create workshops 
to share instructions in person. Additionally, sufficiency practitioners 
gather facts, information, and know-how from outside the business —for 
example, from the academia and civil society. It is essential for them to 
present scientific facts to describe the negative impacts of conventional 
businesses and to explain the alternatives they offer.
Sufficiency-oriented businesses also produce their own knowledge. 
Knowledge and skills are created as sufficiency practices are experi -
mented with, tested, and implemented. The knowledge is then captured 
by practitioners in various forms, such as text and images, and shared 
with others. This learning process is not only an important process 
observed in sufficiency practices, but also an essential part of care 
practices, as Moriggi et al. (2020) mentioned: “Care work becomes 
better when it is based on relations created through intensified 
involvement and knowledge […] Offering the chance to do things 
differently, to do them better, this creates the conditions for trans -
formative learning ” (p.286). Sufficiency practices in business are often 
new, developed by the people involved in the business or replicated 
from existing practices but adapted to an entirely new context, region, or 
situation. Learning from past mistakes and from stakeholders ’ feedback 
is essential to sufficiency. The Fairphone 5 has improved technologies 
and increased percentages of fairly sourced materials compared to its 
previous versions (Fairphone, 2023 ). TEIL.dein Style has adapted the 
practices of other sharing businesses in Germany to fit the local context 
in Bern and is in constant exchange with other practitioners to enhance 
sharing opportunities. Entire supply chains of sufficiency practitioners 
are openly available on their websites for others to use. IFixit ’s core 
activity is the open-source development and sharing of repair knowledge 
(iFixit, 2024 ). For Tronto (2003) , in care ethics, the past serves as a 
guide for future action. Repetition enables sufficiency practices to 
improve and overcome the challenges and ambivalences of the past.
4.Discussion
The literature review identified two dimensions of care: the mean -
ings of care and the elements that enable it. The empirical results indi-
cate that both dimensions of care are not only present in sufficiency 
practices but also support their implementation in businesses. The 
meanings of care shape sufficiency by providing orientation, motivation, 
and meaning, forming a logic of care that underpins sufficiency-oriented 
businesses.
From the care perspective, the world is a network of interconnected, 
vulnerable beings. To sustain life, needs must be met, through relational 
connections, not isolation. Despite the tendencies of neoliberalism to L. Beyeler and M. Jaeger-Erben                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ecological  Economics  238 (2025)  108737

ignore and weaken care activities, care is inevitable. Sufficiency prac-
titioners experience this omnipresence of care at first hand, as they 
engage in sufficiency practices because conventional economic activities 
threaten life and neglect the vulnerabilities of people as well as nature. 
Sufficiency practitioners’ goals are achieved through the establishment 
of various caring relationships—with other businesses, civil society, 
political leaders, employees, and the resources used throughout pro-
duction and consumption. This study highlights these relationships as 
expressions of care, underscoring the importance of inclusive, support -
ive relationships in creating and advancing alternative practices.
Care enablers are essential for sufficiency in business. Time is crucial, 
as building and maintaining caring relationships as well as implement -
ing new practices require more time than conventional business pro-
cesses, which prioritize time and cost efficiency. Despite the lower 
revenues from sufficiency activities, financial resources are vital for 
sufficiency practices. The circulation of funding observed among 
sufficiency-oriented actors reflects the importance of trustful relation -
ships with other stakeholders. Collaboration and sharing of knowledge 
also support the relational nature of sufficiency, enabling actors to ex-
change information, support one another, and build alliances for 
broader transformation. This study highlights indispensable elements, 
such as those in caring practices, which are crucial for the functioning of 
sufficiency. Focusing on these elements is key to supporting the per-
formance of sufficiency in business and potentially in other institutions 
as well.
The findings align with the existing research on sufficiency. The 
relationality of sufficiency is visible in many studies, highlighting the 
importance of collaboration for sufficiency actors (Bocken et al., 2022 ; 
Froese et al., 2023 ; Maurer, 2024 ). Nesterova and Buch-hansen, 2023 ; 
Nesterova and Buch-Hansen, 2024 discussed the multilayered relation -
ships sufficiency-oriented businesses experience, from their material 
connections to nature, the manifold of human interactions, and the 
formation of new social structures, to the personal values and the inner 
nature of the individuals involved. This study similarly highlights the 
range of relationships required for sufficiency and care. Viewing these 
relationships through a care perspective helps challenge existing 
asymmetries and power dynamics in the relationships, as care scholars 
urge for a shift beyond the human-nature duality, calling for kinship 
among humans, more-than-human beings, and non-living entities 
(Cutcher and Dale, 2023 ; Desai and Smith, 2018 ; Haraway, 2015 ; Puig 
de la Bellacasa, 2010 ). In this regard, future research can investigate 
how different communities can engage with a sufficiency-oriented 
business, not only in its activities but also in the ownership of the 
business (see e.g., Gibson-Graham et al., 2020 ).
The idea that sufficiency requires time is not new for sufficiency 
scholars. Decelerating production and business activities is one of the 
main strategies described in the sufficiency literature (Niessen and 
Bocken, 2021 ; Schneidewind and Palzkill-Vorbeck, 2011 ), where many 
processes from production and governance (Bocken et al., 2022 ) to 
consumption behaviors (Cooper, 2005 ; Sandberg, 2021 ) ought to be 
slowed down, as reflected in the literature on slow fashion, for example 
(Fletcher, 2010 ; Sarokin and Bocken, 2024 ). Others define imple -
mentation of sufficiency in business practices as a process, evolving over 
time and enabling practitioners to adapt to emerging challenges as well 
as external resistance (Buch-Hansen and Nesterova, 2021 ; Nesterova 
et al., 2023 ). Care scholars highlight the value of time for care (Cook and 
Trundle, 2020 ; Tronto, 2003 ). Puig de la Bellacasa (2015) emphasized 
the need to “make time for soil” (p.705), to allow this currently 
exhausted living organism to regenerate. Similarly, our findings high-
light how the practices of sufficiency in business strongly depend on 
time as a resource as well as on structures, policies, and other actors to accept alternative, slower temporalities, challenging the one- 
dimensional and linear progress of time in neoliberalism.
The importance of knowledge and money as essential resources for 
sufficiency has also been noted by some sufficiency scholars. Studies 
have described, for example, how the marketing practices of sufficiency 
scholars consist of sharing knowledge and skills with consumers to 
ensure the long-lasting use of products instead of animating consumer 
wants (Bocken et al., 2025 ; Gossen and Kropfeld, 2022 ). Others have 
demonstrated how sufficiency practitioners can utilize social media to 
foster sufficiency (Garcia-Ortega et al., 2024 ). The reliance of 
sufficiency-oriented businesses on external financial investments 
without the expectation of short-term revenues and endless growth is 
described by Maurer (2024) and by Kropfeld and Reichel (2024) . The 
later also recognized that sufficiency generates less income, as profit is 
not the main purpose of sufficiency practitioners (ibid.). These insights 
resonate with our findings on financial means and reveal that the 
financing of sufficiency practices, although essential, remains difficult. 
Future research may search for solutions on how to finance not-for-profit 
and potentially anti-capitalist projects without relying on capitalist 
growth-oriented investments.
While the existing literature highlights the same enablers of suffi-
ciency that were described in our findings, this study urges scholars and 
practitioners to recognize how these enablers are not separate elements; 
rather, they are connected by a logic of care. Our findings suggest that 
care, with its essential elements, supports sufficiency in meeting 
fundamental needs. The novel description of sufficiency as a matter of 
care helps both scholars and practitioners implement sufficiency by first 
offering the context of a care economy as a systemic goal, moving away 
from capitalism, toward a society organized around care. Additionally, it 
helps practitioners focus not only on sufficiency-oriented business 
strategies but also on the essential enabling elements for these strategies. 
For instance, adopting a narrative of care enables businesses to more 
effectively establish and communicate their role in reducing production 
and consumption, while recognizing that they are part of a larger pro-
visioning system that aims to meet genuine needs. Although this 
narrative of sufficiency as a matter of care is currently lacking in both 
practice and research, our findings reveal the multiple ways in which 
care infiltrates and shapes sufficiency practices. They demonstrate that 
the synergies between care and sufficiency are central for transitioning 
to a need-oriented economy. This approach redefines the economy as 
one that prioritizes care and needs over individual profit, enabling the 
reduction in production and consumption that sufficiency scholars and 
practitioners urgently demand.
The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to 
some limitations. First, our care framework summarizes what is common 
ground within the care literature. However, it does not address ambi -
guities and contradictions that exist between different care scholars and 
research fields. For example, some scholars highlight the western bias 
integrated in care ethics and urge for a decolonial and global approach 
to care ethics, considering the perspective of the Global South with 
greater attention (Cook and Trundle, 2020 ; Raghuram, 2016 ). Expand -
ing the framework to incorporate differences can offer more validity. 
Second, while our approach of combining theoretical and empirical it-
erations is unconventional, GT allows for flexibility and non-linearity in 
research. As the iterations presented in this study are part of a larger 
research investigation of the performance of sufficiency in business 
practices, these findings also represent only a single step in developing 
theoretical knowledge about sufficiency as a social phenomenon. 
Further research is necessary to better understand the different aspects 
of sufficiency—for example, the role of relationality in the acceptance 
and diffusion of sufficiency.L. Beyeler and M. Jaeger-Erben                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ecological  Economics  238 (2025)  108737  
10 
The empirical data also has limitations. While we defined the se-
lection criteria to ensure that sufficiency strategies were present, no 
business fully embodies an ideal of sufficiency (see e.g., Nesterova et al., 
2023 ). Sufficiency is a process, and the cases in our study represent 
different stages of its implementation —ranging from lighter to more 
advanced practices. Despite this diversity, the cases revealed similar 
realities, challenges, and solutions, allowing us to identify the key as-
pects of sufficiency from a care perspective. Some studies have sug-
gested that code saturation can be reached with a small sample size in 
homogenous studies (Hennink and Kaiser, 2022 ), lending confidence to 
our findings. Additionally, while the selected cases aim to address needs, 
it remains debatable whether their products and services meet genuine 
needs or merely reflect preferences. To define needs as a business is 
complex in a capitalist context, especially in the absence of broader 
democratic processes to collectively define needs and appropriate sat-
isfiers. For instance, the societal necessity of smartphones can be ques-
tioned critically, considering their social and psychological impacts. 
Nevertheless, in the absence of such societal orientation, companies 
such as Fairphone and Shiftphone, which challenge planned obsoles -
cence, can be interpreted as responding to the currently perceived needs.
