ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a methodology for designers to work in the extensive 
yet marginal landscapes that are produced as part of the process of agri -
cultural intensification. The distributed design approach, which focuses on 
enriching the existing bioinfrastructure of the soil, emerged out an ongoing 
research project in the Conca de Barberà, Spain. The project involves 
managing an interconnected series of currently unproductive on unmain -
tained fields through the rotational grazing of horses, with the hypothesis 
that the systematic grazing regime will catalyse soil biological activity. By 
attending to the soil infrastructure, the project necessarily developed a 
unique design approach. Management decisions became design problems 
and design work took on something of the call and response of manage -
ment. Though it was shaped by the specific constraints and opportunities 
of the research project, the methodology is applicable to a wide variety 
of design projects in extensive landscapes with limited resources.
Introduction
Like much of southern Europe, the Conca de Barberà in northeast Spain spent the beginning 
of 2023 in the midst of severe drought (Morel, 2023 ). The effects were most legible in large 
agricultural landscapes, where extensive monocultures of crops such as wheat were yellowing 
in early spring, typically a time of fresh new growth fed by the winter rains. With harvests 
uncertain, the precarity of these landscapes and the systems that support them came into 
stark relief.
Such landscapes are shaped by patterns of uneven development that produce both simplified 
ecologies of intensive cultivation (Barua, 2022 , p. 2) and their constitutive outsides; the marginal 
lands which are unproductive under the current agricultural regime. The former are a ‘synthesis 
of field and factory’ (Mintz, 1986 , 47) that centralise production and create links to global 
markets. Centralisation is accompanied by a concomitant marginalisation of other landscapes 
(Schmid, 2012 , p. 57). Traci Brynne Voyles ( 2015 ) describes this as wastelanding ; the process 
whereby spaces are discursively produced as empty and devoid of relations, enabling practices 
of waste disposal and extraction that, in turn, serve as markers of their degraded status. Not 
only does wastelanding enable extraction in the present, but it also anticipates and legitimates 
future appropriation (Wolford, 2021 , p. 1630). For example, Nitin Bathla ( 2023 ) shows how

certain landscapes in the Aravalli region of India were classified as wasteland, enabling the 
extraction of value through enclosures and development projects. Such marginalised spaces, 
characterised by abandonment and legacies of extraction, have spread around the world along -
side the ‘modular simplifications’ of capitalist agriculture (Tsing, Mathews, & Bubandt, 2019 , 
p. 189).
Due to a combination of neglect and intermittent disturbance, these landscapes often host 
early successional, opportunistic plant communities. In the Conca de Barberà, pine trees and 
low shrubs proliferate in abandoned fields, and old structures are overgrown with vegetation. 
Such scenes can elicit hopeful visions of a redemptive Nature reclaiming and repairing anthro -
pogenic damage (Millington, 2013 , p. 287). Though seductive, this romantic notion establishes 
an artificial distance between ecological dynamics and human influence (Cronon, 1996 ), sup -
porting the conclusion that it is best to allow these spaces to regenerate autonomously.
In contrast, this paper argues that it is precisely this distance that enables the exploitation 
of marginal landscapes. Instead of abandoning such spaces to ecological self-regulation, it is 
imperative to develop alternative forms of relation. Accordingly, the paper describes a design 
approach that was developed as part of a research project located near the town of Senan in 
Conca de Barberà province in Catalonia, Spain ( Figure 1 ). The 10-year research project, which 
started in 2020, investigates the effects of the rotational grazing of horses on soil biological 
activity in a series of marginal sites. This ‘wild experiment’1 was enabled by a close collaboration 
between landscape architects at the Chair of Being Alive at the ETH Zurich and Marc Sánchez 
and Henar Gomez of Innova Horse Care, who co-designed the project and continue to care for 
the horses. As part of this larger transdisciplinary action research project, I conducted a series 
of semi-structured walk-along interviews with team members, residents, soil scientists, and 
ecologists over the span of five field visits from 2020 to 2023. Along with my colleagues, I

conducted soil samples and vegetation surveys. Additionally, I reviewed geospatial data, archival 
documents, and reports, which inform my analysis of the region’s transformations.
The paper begins by describing how the entwined dynamics of intensification and waste -
landing transformed the agricultural system in the Conca de Barberà. It then introduces the 
research project; first articulating the soil infrastructure as the locus of intervention, and then 
illustrating the rotational grazing strategy at the centre of the project through a case study of 
one of the fields, p la del Mut. This provides a concrete example of how the project team inte -
grated management and design practices. This theme is further developed in the next section 
describing the distributed design approach, which aims to enhance the existing ‘bioinfrastructure’ 
of the soil (p uig de la Bellacasa, 2014 ) through iterative management. The conclusion argues 
that new design methodologies and project structures are necessary to affect change in these 
extensive and overlooked landscapes.
Tracing intensification and wastelanding in the so-called-forest
Coming to the region as an outsider for the first time in 2020, the landscape appeared fixed. 
Located in the north of the Coca de Barberà, the territory contains a series of parallel dry valleys 
that run perpendicular to the Serra del Tallat ridgeline. The valley floors feature the most fertile 
soil, and these gently sloping areas are terraced with dry-stone walls that support the cultivation 
of cereals. The steeper side slopes are also terraced, with the walls running perpendicular to 
those in the valley bottom. These terraces, narrowing as the slope becomes steeper further up 
the hillside, support olive trees, almond trees, and vineyards. Further up, the terraces are 
increasingly uncommon, and pine trees dominate. The relationship between this agricultural 
logic and the topography is visible in Figure 2 . Organised around the availability of water, this 
pattern responds to the region’s Hot Summer Mediterranean ( Csa) climate with its three-month 
summer drought, as well as the geological condition featuring layers of predominantly calcic 
sedimented material. It was easy to imagine the agricultural logic had persisted unchanged for 
centuries. In fact, it soon became clear that this was a territory in flux. To attend to these patchy 
more-than-human dynamics (Tsing et  al., 2019 ), I describe the extent and effects of the region’s 
transformations through a tour of one of the woodlands that occupy the ridges around Senan.
What appears to be a homogenous forest from the outside is, upon closer reading, a mosaic 
of plant communities shaped by divergent histories of management and neglect. It is, perhaps, 
not even a forest at all.2 Upon entering the woodland, it is possible to determine the dominant 
species; the Aleppo p ine ( Pinus halepensis ). It soon becomes clear that many of the trees are 
showing signs of decline. Some are tilting to the side; others are covered with mistletoe ( Viscum 
album ), a hemi-parasite that weakens its host over time (Lázaro-González et  al., 2021 ). The fact 
that the trees are all the same age and Pinus halepensis  seeds require full sun to germinate 
(Ne’eman, Goubitz, & Nathan, 2004 ) suggests that are early successional pioneers which grew 
together in an open field.
If one continues walking upslope through the pines, eventually they will pass dry stacked 
stone walls; the same walls that support the terraced fields below. These walls record the 
high-water mark of agricultural production in the region. They likely originate from an economic 
boom in the second half of the nineteenth century, when the arrival of the phylloxera insect 
decimated French vineyards, causing a spike in grape production in Catalonia and the subse -
quent cultivation of marginal areas through the construction of new terraces (Badia-Miró, Tello, 
Valls, & Garrabou, 2010 ). This boom was short-lived. p hylloxera arrived in the Conca de Barberà 
in 1893, precipitating an economic crisis and the abandonment of many of the newly constructed 
fields (Llobet i p ortella & Bach i Riu, 1983 , p. 293).
The late nineteenth century was not the only moment of change. Many fields were aban -
doned following the industrialisation of agriculture, which in this part of Catalonia proceeded 
slowly until 1950, and rapidly thereafter (Cartanyà Martí, 2010 , p. 18). Before this transformation,

the agricultural system relied on animals for both power and nutrients. Raising animals and 
growing crops were complementary activities, with the waste from one supplying the needs of 
the other (Cartanyà Martí, 2010 , p. 131). An integrated system of livestock and crop management 
supported a heterogeneity of land uses with minor changes from the 1860s through the 1950s 
(Tello, Garrabou, Cussó, & Olarieta, 2008 , p. 116). This reciprocal system disintegrated as the 
region became increasingly linked to global markets, which supplied fertilisers and absorbed 
surpluses (Cartanyà Martí, 2010 ). Simultaneously, farm machines replaced draft animals. These 
machines centralised and intensified production (Tello et al., 2008 , p. 105). Not only were certain

bottoms; almonds, olives, and grapes in smaller side terraces; and pine trees along the ridge tops. c redit: shen he, chair

steep or narrow fields no longer accessible, but it also became increasingly efficient to farm 
larger parcels of flat land, making the marginal land no longer worthwhile to cultivate (Foster, 
2016 ). The high costs and associated risks of buying the machines incentivised farmers to ensure 
predictable and productive harvests. This meant sowing new varieties of high-yielding seeds, 
which in turn demanded new fertilisers and phytosanitary treatments to protect the plants from 
diseases (Museo de la Vida Rural, 2020 ). Generally, this transformation led to a reduction of 
spatial complexity and biodiversity (Tello et  al., 2008 , p. 114). The changes can be seen in in 
Figure 3 , where a comparison of satellite photos from 1946 and 2020 attests to the widespread 
abandonment of marginal fields and intensification of production in the valley bottoms. These 
former fields are now forested, corresponding to the uppermost portion of Figure 2 .
Comparing the two satellite photos also reveals that some areas have been covered with 
trees for more than three quarters of a century. Although seemingly unchanged from an aerial 
perspective, these spaces have also undergone a dramatic transformation. Returning to the 
forest, if one walks long enough, at some point they will find a stand of multi-trunked Holm 
Oaks ( Quercus ilex ). These are overgrown coppices, once cut every 20–40 years but likely aban -
doned since the 1950s (Unrau et  al., 2018 , p. 333). They attest to the metabolic relationships 
that linked the forest to the agricultural system. The harvested wood provided energy for 
cooking and heating. It was also burned in small structures called formiguers  and the resulting 
charcoal was spread on the fields as fertiliser (Olarieta et  al., 2011 ). Many of these stands of 
coppiced oaks were managed as commons (Guadilla-Sáez, p ardo-de-Santayana, & Reyes-García, 
2020 ). Now privately owned, management patterns have changed. Instead of slow-growing oaks, 
landowners favour the straight wood and fast growth of the pines, often clearing young oak 
trees that grow in the pines’ shade (Folch i Guillén, 1986 , p. 99). Hasty logging operations left

behind slash piles of unwanted wood, exacerbating the existing fire danger (Ne’eman et  al., 
2004 ). Elsewhere, a patch of forest near Senan was recently cleared for a manure pond sup -
porting nearby industrial pig farming operations. This analysis of the forest shows how the 
entwined dynamics of intensification and wastelanding have shaped the landscape around 
Senan. Former fields are now covered in declining pines, at risk of fire and further exploitation. 
Rather than a romantic narrative of previously agricultural land returning to so-called nature, 
the disinvestment in these spaces opens opportunities for new forms of extraction that prolif -
erate in marginal areas.
Building a soil infrastructure through rotational grazing
While the vegetation provides the most visible evidence of the transformation of the region, 
the relatively ephemeral plant communities express the condition of the soil.3 Formed by the 
region’s history, the soil is the connective tissue linking the disparate elements, establishing the 
site’s limitations and potentials (Krzywoszynska & Marchesi, 2020 ). While there is no detailed 
soil map of the project area, through interpolation, it is possible to define three main soil types: 
the deep Comapregona soil  located in the valley bottoms; the Emprius soil  running along the 
mid-slopes; and the Morull soil,  which is the shallowest and is found on the tops of ridges 
(Mapa de sòls, 2018 ). The three typological soils provide a basic framework within which a wide 
range of alternatives are possible. The classification defines the key parameters of these soils, 
such as weak development, a high pH, a texture ranging from loam to silty clay loam, and soil 
depth decreasing higher up the slope (Mapa de sòls, 2018 ). While it reveals the weak soil 
development shaped by the climate and the high pH due to the calcareous parent material, 
the classification provides little information about the biological activity, which is increasingly 
recognised as a key factor in the soil’s ecological performance (Gobat, Aragno, & Matthey, 2004 ). 
Biological activity, encompassing the metabolism of soil inhabitants, varies dramatically over 
relatively short temporal and spatial scales, and it is significantly affected by vegetation cover 
and management practices (Nannipieri, Greco, & Ceccanti, 1990 ). The role of anthropogenic 
dynamics in soil formation reveals soil to be a profoundly social entity; shaped by agricultural 
techniques and production systems, both a product and archive of the region’s history (Engel-Di 
Mauro, 2016 ).
Maria p uig de la Bellacasa’s conception of soil as a ‘bioinfrastructure’ helps to define the 
project’s locus of intervention. She builds on Susan Leigh Star’s description of infrastructure as 
‘invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work’ ( 1999 , p. 380) to argue that soil 
functions as the ‘dismissed infrastructure of the bios ’ (puig de la Bellacasa, 2014 , p. 2). Like 
landscapes, infrastructures are not only composed of things, but also the relations between 
them (Larkin, 2013 , p. 329; Olwig, 2003 , p. 875). There is much attention to how landscapes 
can function as infrastructure (Bélanger, 2017 ; Milligan, 2015 ), but this is marked by a focus on 
‘built things. ’ That is, infrastructure as composed of technical objects (Davis, Holmes, & Milligan, 
2015 ). By instead emphasising the relational qualities of these landscape infrastructures, it 
becomes possible to design with the more-than-human relations that ‘generate ambient envi -
ronments of everyday life’ (Barua, 2021 , p. 1,468).
To counter the ongoing marginalisation of the abandoned fields in Senan, the research 
project attempts to enrich this living infrastructure. Since a soil infrastructure is composed of 
continuously reproduced relationships, it necessarily develops over time. Accordingly, the research 
project adopted an incremental approach. In 2020, designers from the ETH Zurich partnered 
with local landowners and landscape managers. Together, the team developed a strategy to 
manage an interconnected series of marginal fields through the rotational grazing of horses. 
The majority of the horses arrived from the shelters operated by Asociación Defensa de los 
Équidos, which supports animals that have been mistreated or abandoned. The parameters of 
the rotational grazing system became key variables in the design process, allowing the project 
LANDSCApE  RESEARCH 7
to incrementally affect the soil condition in an extensive manner. The following section describes 
this approach using the example of p la del Mut, one of the project sites.
Rotational grazing at Pla del Mut
Like the other project sites, p la de Mut is characterised by histories of intensive cultivation. 
prior to our involvement, the area was hastily logged, leaving behind crooked, unsaleable pines 
and piles of wood. In November 2023, the project team visited the site, which is one of the 8 
fields distributed throughout the valley that constitute the research project ( Figure 4 ). At the 
time of the visit, the project’s fences, which divide the field into 23 paddocks approximately 
1,000m2 in size, had already been installed. One of the paddocks was occupied by 8 horses4 
intently grazing the mixture of grasses and low shrubs. The horses remained there for a single 
day, grazing intensively before moving onto another paddock, which was chosen based on 
where the plants were in the best condition to receive them ( Figure 5 ).
As with any rotational grazing strategy, the precise timing and intensity of these simple 
actions are crucial. Rotational grazing is a system for dividing a given field into smaller paddocks 
and moving animals between them, allowing the remaining paddocks time to regenerate (Mann 
& Sherren, 2018 ). The approach used in this project builds on the p astoreo Racional Voisin (pRV) 
method first developed by Andre Voisin in the 1950s (Voisin, 1959 /2021 ). Typically used in 
extensive cattle farming, pRV is a method for ‘managing the soil–plant–animal complex through 
direct grazing and well-planned pasture rotation’ (p inheiro Machado Filho et  al., 2021 , p. 3) that 
has been modified to the needs of many ruminants, including horses (Undersander, Albert, 
Cosgrove, Johnson, & p eterson, 2014 ). In comparison to other forms of rotational grazing, such 
as mob grazing and the Savory system, pRV typically features intensive management, since the

animals move to a new paddock each day, lower stocking densities, and rest periods determined 
by the regrowth of the vegetation.
This project deployed pRV as a land management strategy. Two variables are particularly 
important: the intensity of grazing and the duration of rest between visits.5 The fences that 
divide the fields into paddocks serve to modulate these two variables. First, the fences define 
the area that will be grazed each day, thus determining the intensity of grazing. In p RV, the 
paddock should be small enough that it is grazed uniformly but large enough that plants are 
not grazed twice, which translates into short occupation times with stocking densities higher 
than found in continuous grazing (Voisin, 1959 /2021 ). This intensive grazing concentrates the 
horses’ manure and urine in a small area, which promotes the decomposition of the organic 
matter and its incorporation into the soil, thus fuelling the plants’ regrowth (p inheiro Machado 
Figure 5.  horses grazing at p la del Mut. c redit: chair of Being a live, e Th Zurich.
LANDSCApE  RESEARCH 9
Filho et  al., 2021 , p. 5). Along with controlling the intensity of grazing, the fence system deter -
mines the duration of the rest period between visits. In the pRV system, grazing should occur 
after the plants’ Optimum Recovery p eriod (OR p), which means immediately before the plant 
redirects its energy from vegetative to reproductive growth (p inheiro Machado Filho et al., 2021 , 
p. 4). Following the initial grazing, the plants use their energy reserves to grow new aerial 
shoots. When the plants have accumulated sufficient energy in their root system for vigorous 
regrowth, but before flowering, the plants have completed their ORp , and the foliage contains 
maximum nutrients for the grazing animals (Voisin, 1959 /2021 ). Grazing at this moment catalyses 
a chain of biological reactions that contribute to the mineralisation organic matter and the 
formation of soil aggregates (Gobat et  al., 2004 , p. 77). By delaying the reproductive phase, 
carefully timed grazing intensifies these exchanges with the soil ecosystem as the plants work 
to regrow and replenish reserves. The land manager watches the vegetation, deciding when 
the target species in each plot have completed their ORp and are ready to be grazed again.
After closely observing how the plants responded to grazing, Sánchez determined that the 
grasses at p la del Mut, such as Brachypodium retusum  and Avenula pubescens,  were not regen -
erating as quickly as anticipated, likely a result of the unseasonable drought. After discussing 
the options, the team decided to adjust the fence layout so the paddocks could expand, reducing 
the total number of paddocks in the project, but allowing the horses a larger area to graze 
each day. This capacity for adaptation was built into the initial design, which combined a robust 
perimeter fence incorporating salvaged wood with mobile interior fencing. While it reduced the 
total number of paddocks, increasing the average size provided additional forage for the horses 
and decreased grazing pressure on the grasses, reducing the chance of overgrazing and allowing 
the plants to recover fully before the horses return.
Distributed design approach
After several years, a specific way of working emerged out of the project’s unique goals and 
constraints, particularly from the aim of modifying the web of living relations that compose 
the sites’ soil infrastructure. As a shorthand, this methodology can be called a distributed design 
approach. The design process is both distributed over time, expanding to include what is nor -
mally considered the maintenance phase of the project, and also distributed among multiple 
actors, granting design agency to those who manage the project. It is inspired by adaptive 
management, a widely accepted but unevenly applied technique in the natural sciences for 
managing dynamic ecosystems (Allan & Stankey, 2009 ). Adaptive management has been slow 
to hybridise with design methodologies in landscape architecture (Kato & Ahern, 2008 , p. 543). 
Instead, landscape projects typically follow the phases of an architectural project (Davis & Oles, 
2014 ), with limited overlap between design and maintenance phases (Hopper, 2006 , p. 26). This 
is beginning to change as designers and researchers recognise the limitations of this model 
(Geffel, 2021 ; Raxworthy, 2018 ). Instead of a sequence of indefinitely repeated actions, mainte -
nance can become an interdisciplinary locus of ongoing design exploration, providing oppor -
tunities for participatory decision-making (Chambelland, 2021 ), sharing design agency (Waterman, 
2017 ; Terremoto, 2023 ), and contesting the division of labour that underlies the reproduction 
of landscapes (Franco, 2022 ; Jacobs & Wiens, 2023 ).
The distributed design methodology builds on this work. It relies on (a) a systematic design 
approach; (b) open-ended and minimal design interventions; and (c) mechanisms for feedback 
that are built in from the beginning. Initially, the design is articulated as a series of parameters. 
This process then guides the development of a minimal design proposal, which makes efficient 
use of resources and allows space for ongoing design engagement. For example, early on, the 
project team installed low-cost fences. These simple fences have since been modified through 
an iterative and still-ongoing design process. Certain public-facing fences are evolving into 
hedgerows with edible fruits and berries that benefit from the enhanced soil infrastructure. 
10 L. HARRIS
Other fences are strengthened with branches left over from previous logging operations, shaped 
into intricate installations by local woodworkers. Leaving the design open-ended and dispersing 
design resources over a longer period distributes design agency among a wider group. From 
the beginning, mechanisms for feedback were built into the project. This allowed management 
insights and design thinking to mutually influence each other. In this project, the mechanisms 
that supported ongoing feedback were what Teresa Galí-Izard calls dynamic diagrams (Mouritz 
& Gali-Izard, 2018 ) and collective fieldwork. A description of each will further illustrate 
this method.
The project team developed dynamic diagrams using Grasshopper, a parametric plugin for 
the Rhinoceros 3D modelling program (Galí-Izard, Harris, Turett, & Walker, 2022 ; Ma & Gali-Izard, 
2022 ). The diagrams represented key project components, in this case the system of fencing 
and the sequence of grazing. The drawings can be quickly modified to account for new infor -
mation, such as a change in the number of horses or the paddock layout. Crucially, the diagrams 
could depict change over time, showing the projected regeneration time of each plot and the 
anticipated movement of the horses. Figure 6  shows the estimated regeneration time for the 
paddocks in one of the fields at two different moments in the year. The drought in the summer 
results in a significantly longer regeneration period than when the same paddock is grazed in 
April. Though they are not predictive models, these drawings facilitated collaboration between 
disciplines by enabling team members to visualise and plan for multiple scenarios (Holmes, 
2020 ). The drawings allowed landowners, managers, and designers to collaborate during the 
early phases of the project. Thus, the particularities of the rotational grazing method and pref -
erences of the horses, such as their dislike of tight corners, were incorporated into the diagrams 
and, in turn, into the design intervention. After observing changes, the diagrams were modified, 
facilitating communication among team members about key project relationships and assumptions.
The process of collective fieldwork provided further opportunities to productively entangle 
design and management practices. At the beginning of the project, the team conducted a series 
of open-ended walks with botanists, soil scientists, and local inhabitants, building a common 
store of knowledge about the site and its history. These visits integrated multiple modes of 
apprehending the landscape, combining mushroom hunting and berry picking with more typical 
surveys and assessments. For example, the search for the ideal place for a picnic on a hot day 
revealed much about one site’s soil conditions, sun exposure, and canopy cover; information 
which later informed the layout of the fencing. These group excursions served to attune par -
ticipants to a shared sensibility.
Fieldwork has evolved as the project has taken shape. Regular monitoring to assess how the 
management regime affects the soil and plant communities now complements the unstructured 
site visits. This testing provides further mechanisms for attunement to site dynamics (Lutsky & 
Burkholder, 2017 ). Wherever possible, monitoring is conducted collectively since the conversation 
and exchange provides important insights. This proved the case even if the participants were 
not previously familiar with the project or site. For example, in 2022, a group of architecture 
students from the ETH Zurich visited for a week and provided a fresh perspective on the project, 
contributing to its development through design workshops and critical engagement. Continuing 
site visits have become a way to sensitise the designers to the call and response which char -
acterises landscape management (Argent, 2009 , p. 13). This ongoing fieldwork involves monitoring 
changes, evaluating observed conditions against expectations, and collectively generating 
responses.
Dynamic diagrams and collective fieldwork provided mechanisms to link the iterative design 
tools of landscape architecture with the work of caring for landscapes. Affecting meaningful 
change in these dynamic conditions requires a sustained rhythm of incremental interventions 
calibrated by regular observation and adjustment. By attending to the soil infrastructure, the 
project necessarily developed a unique design approach. Management decisions became design 
problems and design work took on something of the call and response of management.

Discussion: adaptive practices in marginal landscapes
Recognising that the dynamics of intensification and wastelanding will continue apace, it is 
important to ask how designers can intervene in the spaces these processes produce. Driven 
by the pressure to generate increasing profits, intensification leads to the adoption of ever-more 
intensive farming techniques, even as industrial agriculture embraces the label of ‘regenerative’ 
(Cronin, 2022 ). Concurrently, wastelanding leads to spaces strategically made empty of relations 
and marked by a limited access to resources (Voyles, 2015 , p. 7). Yet these marginalised land -
scapes can provide a site for the emergence of alternatives. One key insight from scholars of 
plantations is that the relatively infertile, marginal land outside the fields of the plantation 
proper were ‘provision grounds’ (Wynter, 1971 , p. 99), serving as a means of sustenance (Carney, 
2021 ), and enabling reproduction and resistance (Mitman & Allewaert, 2019 ). While I am hesitant 
to romanticise the marginal (Harvey, 1996 , p. 105) and ruderal (Stoetzer, 2022 , p. 10) as 
Figure 6.  dynamic diagram showing the estimated regeneration times of the same paddock grazed at two different 
moments. c redit: chair of Being a live, e Th Zurich.

well-springs of nebulously defined resistance, these sites offer opportunities for more open 
experimentation and collective action.
The region’s history provides another source of possible alternative configurations. As 
described above, many of the forests were at one point managed in common. In her study 
of wastelands in Britain, Vittoria Di palma ( 2014 ) shows how common land came to be under -
stood as waste. This discursive shift contributed to the widespread enclosure of the commons, 
which was justified in terms of the improvement it would bring (Di p alma, 2014 , p. 28). Bathla 
(2023 ) proposes ‘restorative commoning’ to resist both the processes of wastelanding that 
render certain landscapes disposable and the connected desire to improve such spaces through 
normative forms of greening, which typically serve elite interests. The latent communal prac -
tices in the Conca de Barberà can serve as inspiration for alternative ways of managing 
landscapes.
If designers have a role to play in these spaces, there is a need for innovative ways of work -
ing that combine the fresh perspective afforded by distance with local land management 
practices. These novel methodologies could aim to enrich relational infrastructures, which are 
shaped by humans and nonhumans (Cho, 2021 ; Jacobs, 2019 ). Such infrastructures, which nec -
essarily develop slowly over time, frame the potential futures of these marginalised sites. To 
develop such relational infrastructures, design practice must adapt to the incremental tempo -
ralities of living systems through observation and response, necessitating new methodologies 
and project structures. Landscape architects can learn much from the fields of regenerative 
agriculture (Giller, Hijbeek, Andersson, & Sumberg, 2021 ) and ecosystem management (Allan & 
Stankey, 2009 ; Allen & Garmestani, 2015 ), to develop approaches which bring the unique capac -
ities of design thinking to bear on the issues faced by marginal landscapes. But crucially, these 
novel approaches cannot just be ecologically informed techno-fixes to narrowly defined problems. 
Instead, they must critically respond to the political dynamics that reproduce uneven landscapes, 
recognising the unique possibilities and limitations of design projects to affect socioecological 
change. The results may lack the markers of a typical landscape architectural project, instead 
fading into the background, discernible only if one is looking for them. And yet they reveal 
the potential of the discipline to adapt to the ongoing crises of our time.
Notes
 1. Bruce Braun defines wild experiments as ‘ …experiments in procedure in a situation of ecological and 
political uncertainty, able to incorporate new and unexpected human and nonhuman actors, and making 
room for different ways of knowing by farmers, hunters, amateur naturalists and local residents’ ( 2015 , p. 
109). The research project uses a network of test sites and controls to assess soil and vegetation respons -
es to the new management regime with preliminary results forthcoming.
 2. Botanists classify these areas as brolla arbrada , which indicates a shrubland community featuring trees of 
minor ecological significance (Folch i Guillén, 1986 , p. 25).
 3. plants that appear spontaneously in fields can reveal much about soil conditions (p ankhurst, Doube, & 
Gupta, 1997 ). Farmers can interpret these weeds, otherwise known as bioindicators, as signals of the 
level of compaction, nutrient availability, and water holding capacity of the soil (Ducerf, 2020 ).
 4. The number of horses in a group has varied over the course of the project in response to their social 
dynamics and the growth rate of the vegetation.
 5. These correspond to the first two of the four rules of pRV codified by Voisin ( 1959 /2021 ).
