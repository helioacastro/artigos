    ENCOUNTERS WITH MATERIALS IN 
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION 
  Encounters With Materials in Early Childhood Education  rearticulates understandings 
of materials—blocks of clay, sheets of paper, brushes, and paints—to formulate 
what happens when we think with materials and apply them to early childhood development and classrooms. The book develops ways of thinking about materials that are more sustainable and insightful than what most children in the Western world experience today through capitalist narratives. 
 Through a series of ethnographic events and engagement with existing ideas 
of relationality in the visual arts, feminist ethics, science studies, philosophy, and 
anthropology,  Encounters With Materials in Early Childhood Education  highlights 
how materials can be conceptualized as active participants in early childhood education and as generators of human insight. A variety of examples show how educators, young children, and researchers have engaged in thinking with materi-als in early years classrooms and explore what materials are capable of in their encounters with other materials and with children.

 THINKING WITH MATERIALS 
 In the early childhood classroom, educators and children gather around materials 
to investigate, negotiate, converse, and share. A block of clay, a brush, pots of paint, a brilliant sheet of paper, a heavy rectangular wooden block, a thin piece of willow charcoal—materials beckon and pull us in. They live, speak, gesture, and call to us. Materials can evoke memories, narrate stories, invite actions, and communicate ideas. 
 This book sets out to experiment with pedagogies of relationality that emerge 
when we encounter materials as active participants in early childhood education. 
Nothing in its pages acts as an appropriate model of practice. There is nothing to rehearse, nothing to appropriate. The book is about  encounters . Encounters 
that are not necessarily good or bad. These are risky, worldly encounters that affect us, provoke us to think and feel, attach us to the world and detach us from it, force us into action, demand from us, prompt us to care, concern us, bring us into question. 
 Experimenting with these encounters entails nudging ourselves to experience 
them differently. We do not ﬁ  nd, nor are we looking for, the meaning of these 
encounters. We are not concerned with their facts. We engage with each 
encounter as an event that demands its own questions, its own concerns, its own ethos. We inhabit each encounter. We are situated in each encounter’s situatedness. 
 Eventful Material Relations 
  Encounters With Materials in Early Childhood Education  aims to tell stories of what 
happens when we think  with  materials, when we choose to see materials as 
movements, as encounters, as assemblages, as ecologies, as time. Materials live in 
2 Thinking With Materials
the world in multiple ways (Bennett, 2004). In the chapters that follow, we think 
with ﬁ  ve materials that are often found in early childhood spaces: paper, charcoal, 
paint, clay, and blocks. We treat these materials as active and participatory. They set things in motion, incite questions, produce ideas. In other words, they become productive moments. 
 Throughout the book, materials generate insights by provoking human and 
nonhuman others. We pay attention to a wide spectrum of forces and move-
ments: how materials move through time and space; how materials move us, physically and emotionally; how time moves; how air moves; how bodies move; and more. 
 Thinking  with  materials transforms early childhood education, provoking 
educators to notice how materials and young children live entangled lives in 
classrooms, how they change each other through their mutual encounters. We are curious about the ways such a shift in perspective might change our interac-tions with materials, children, other educators—and perhaps even change the nature of our engagement with society and the world. 
 The greater goal of this book is to reassemble early childhood spaces as vibrant 
social-ecological-material-affective-discursive ecologies in which humans and 
nonhumans are always in relation. Relationality, therefore, is central to  Encounters 
With Materials . 
 In this chapter, we tell stories of how materials are conceptualized in early 
childhood education and how we think of materials throughout this book. We 
outline the project this book is based on: what we did, the questions we asked, how we integrated materials through the arts, how we used video and photog-raphy. In other words, this chapter is where our theoretical and methodological frameworks are set into motion. Y et, this introduction is not written to support the book’s structure. Like the book itself, it is written through diffractive move-ments to produce new possibilities. 
 Materials in Early Childhood 
 Engagements with materials are certainly not new in the early childhood litera-
ture. Since the 19th century, early childhood scholars have emphasized materials’ importance for the development and education of young children. Frederick Froebel’s gifts, the ﬁ  rst educational toys developed in the 1800s, have marked materials’ central role in early education (Prochner, 2011), but John Dewey (1897) reminded us more than a century ago that “the child’s own instincts and powers furnish the material and give the starting point for all education” (art. 1, para. 3). 
 T oday, scholars continue to highlight the importance of materials in young 
children’s learning. Processes such as painting with a brush and working with 
clay are seen as activities that contribute to children’s social, physical, emotional, and creative development (Golomb, 1992; Lowenfeld & Brittain, 1987; Matthews, 
Thinking With Materials 3
2003). The majority of texts available emphasize what to do with materials, yet 
say little about how one might think  with  them. 
 While movements have been made toward thinking of children’s artistic 
explorations of materials as languages (Pelo, 2007), even early childhood centers 
that integrate the arts in their practices typically use developmental understand-ings of materials and artistic processes. There may be an interest and desire to engage with the arts as a visual language, yet without a depth of conceptual understanding, too often children’s art is viewed as literal representations of self, experience, or knowledge. Materials are described as “bones” of curriculum (Carter & Curtis, 2007) in a developmental progression from exploration to representation. Often, instructions on how to organize and arrange materials are ﬁ rst provided so that children will learn the materials’ properties and functions. 
Then, as they become more familiar with the materials, children are encouraged to use them to represent ideas and objects. 
 Pedagogues in the Reggio Emilia infant and preschool programs in northern 
Italy have paid close attention to materials, and philosophically complex ideas 
have been generated from their investigations of materiality (Ceppi & Zini, 2008; Friends of Reggio, 2004; Vecchi, 2010; Vecchi & Giudici, 2004). We see today a myriad of early childhood classrooms inspired by the practices in Reggio Emilia around materials (Callaghan, 2002; Fraser, 2006; Gerst, 1998, 2002, 2003; Kocher, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2010; MacDonald-Carlson, 1997, 2003; Rosen, 2009; Tarr, 2005; Tarr, Bjartveit, Kostiuk, & McCowan, 2009; Wien, 2008; Wong, 2006; Y oung, 2001). 
 We, too, have been greatly inspired by the Reggio Emilia pedagogical work. 
Despite the work’s signiﬁ  cance for our ﬁ  eld’s development, though, little of the 
Reggio-inspired early childhood literature focuses on how materials can take 
part in shaping ideas. This is the focus of our book. 
 The connections that  Encounters With Materials in Early Childhood Education  
creates might surprise some readers. Instead of suggesting that carefully selected, 
beautifully organized materials be offered to children to experiment with and to represent their ideas and theories, this book thinks  with  materials—alongside 
them, listening to and caring for them, being with and being for things, explor-ing an ecology and ethics of things (Benso, 2000). We engage in thinking beyond instrumentalism, which reduces things to surface qualities and functions and treats materials as merely what mediates learning and developmental processes (e.g., Rule & Stewart, 2002; Trimis & Savva, 2009). 
 We investigate how materials “speak back” to children in agentic ways, 
extending and broadening the important body of knowledge on Reggio Emilia–
inspired practices. Simultaneously, we generate original research to inform what Hillevi Lenz Taguchi (2010) refers to as an  intra-active pedagogy  that shifts attention 
from intra- and interpersonal relationships toward a material–discursive relation-ship among all living organisms and the material environment, such as objects and artifacts, spaces and places. 
4 Thinking With Materials
  Encounters With Materials in Early Childhood Education  challenges understand-
ings of materials that deﬁ  ne them from a scientiﬁ  c, rational, or functional view-
point and through predictable properties of color, shape, density, mass, friction, 
and gravity. We contest deeply rooted cultural dichotomies—animate versus inanimate, active versus passive, and self versus other, to name a few (Bennett, 2010)—that lead us, often unconsciously, to think of ourselves as animate agents who act on passive, inanimate materials. We ask: What if humans’ role in shaping materials is not as central as we believe? What if materials shape us as much as we shape them? What if we pay attention to the effects of things and to how things move together, not asking what an object or a thing or a material  is,  but 
what does a material  do?  
 In this book, materials themselves propose particular possibilities. Materials 
do not just feel or act differently from each other, or have different properties, 
or produce different forms and images. They also provoke different ways of thinking as a child engages and works with them. 
 A block, for instance, is not just a tool for building. A block evokes particular 
ways of thinking, processing ideas, and making meaning that are profoundly 
different from the ways one works with paint, charcoal, paper, or clay, for example. In drawing a human ﬁ  gure or in using a camera to create a particular image of a person, the subject may be the same, yet engaging with different media and processes results in different perceptions and ways of thinking through the subject. 
 This means that how we think about materials shapes what is possible to 
do with them. For example, if we think of clay as a sculptural material used 
for making objects, that thought suggests certain engagements. We may set out individual slabs or balls of clay on a table and give directions or support in how to create particular objects. We may talk about form, texture, struc-ture, and balance. We may subtly or directly encourage individual sculptural objects. 
 What we think clay is for shapes our experience with it, and the language 
we use to talk about the experience constructs particular meanings. If, on the 
other hand, we think about movement, place, impermanence, and relationality, then we may consider the possibility of moving toward and away from the clay, 
attending to the relationship of clay to its surroundings, and inviting interaction with others. 
 These concepts give structure to and shape the investigations with the mate-
rial. And so we may set the clay out in other ways, for instance, as a big block 
in the center of a large mat on the ﬂ  oor, as several blocks stacked so they echo a child’s height, in a space with several overhead projectors to facilitate a complex play of shadow, bodies, and movement. These various ways of setting out the clay do not just invite different interactions. They also shape what and how we see and the meanings we construct of the experience. 
Thinking With Materials 5
 The “Material Encounters in Early 
Childhood Education” Project 
 This book works with pedagogical events collected through the “Material 
Encounters in Early Childhood Education” project, a visual ethnographic study conducted in two early childhood centers in Canada and supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. The project’s main goal has been to engage in an art-based collaborative inquiry to experiment with the com-plexities and possibilities of engaging with materials’ relationality in early child-hood spaces. 
 Inquiring Into Materiality 
 Over a period of three years, children, educators, and researchers became inter-
ested in what might happen to pedagogies when their focus is not solely on how children think about materials, or how materials should be presented to children, or what children’s or educators’ intentions are in relation to materials. Our focus became paying careful attention to materials in interaction. Through that process, we discovered that materials have a life of their own in classrooms and that these lives matter immensely for how we think and act in classrooms. We took materials seriously, not to romanticize them or to think of them as humans, but to attend to what they do when they participate in classrooms. We encountered each material as already ﬁ  lled with histories and stories, and also as an event that would allow us to ask questions and provoke inquiries. 
 In our weekly inquiries with children and educators, we asked: What does 
it mean to think  with  things? How does each material evoke particular invita-
tions and provocations? How does each material live differently among/with/
between other things and among/with/between young children? How are materials implicated in a classroom’s movements? These questions framed our collaborations. 
 Experimentation 
 Materials, objects, places, and environments are inextricably bound to experi-
mentation; thus, experimentation was key to our inquiries. The work of phi-losophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (1987) helped us to conceptualize our experimentations with materials. Experimentation is a complex social-affective-political phenomenon that actively extends experience (Guattari, 1995). It opens up worlds and creates new venues for thinking and doing (Stengers, 2005). It reveals what human and nonhuman bodies can do and produce when they encounter each other. We embraced experimentation in our collaboration to transform life in the early childhood centers. 
6 Thinking With Materials
 We committed ourselves to see encounters among materials, objects, places, 
and humans as part of the ﬂ  ow of experience. We created pedagogies that assume 
that we are never separate from the world, that we are made up of relations. Following Deleuze and Guattari, we conceptualized thought as experimentation: Thought creates itself through encounters. We experimented with the ideas that stories are told, forces are harnessed, and roles are performed through thought. 
 Through experimentation we discovered how something works by relations 
among the parts of assemblages, structures, ﬂ  ows, and connections. In this way 
we assumed teaching and learning as processes of creating what Deleuze and 
Guattari (1987) called lines of ﬂ  ight. By testing new and unpredictable mixes of bodies, forces, and things, we invented. Our process of inquiry into the unknown became embedded in the experimentation of experience, with all its unpredictable connections. Our experiments were not without risk, of course. Outcomes could never be predicted or known in advance. There was always the danger of reproducing the same, of decomposing one or more elements of an assemblage too quickly. Certainly, our project has been imperfect. It has been marked by struggle and, at times, resistance. The work has been slow, often challenging and unsettling. Y et, we committed to staying with the trouble, as Haraway (2008) suggests, that our experimentations brought to us. 
 Experimentation brought life to our sedimented early childhood discourses, 
increased our capacity to act in the world, and produced new forms of living 
(see O’Sullivan, 2006). It allowed us to open up perceptions and understandings of what is possible in the classroom. We engaged with children, materials, nar-ratives, and each other as if they act on us and we act on them, entering into complex, entangled networks and assemblages—or, to use Lenz Taguchi’s (2010) term, into intra-activity. We got to know the power, vibrancy, timeliness, pos-sibilities, and consequences of a material. 
 This did not mean that we ignored children in our inquiries. We were inter-
ested in what children select, what they choose as desirable, and what they bring 
into their play. But we were also aware that experimentation does not only involve children’s creative inventions. We worked within the tensions and ethics of listening to children’s own concerns as we took seriously the materials and discourses children play with. We began from this question: How do children take the substance of their lives—the circulating images, narratives, and ideas—and make something of them, inventing, reproducing, transforming? 
 In the chapters that follow, we hope it becomes clearer how experimenta-
tion was encouraged in the early childhood centers, how the educators looked 
for ways to provoke and facilitate experimentation, how “problems” were worked with and not “managed,” how most of the work that took place in the classrooms was collective and not “owned” by particular children. Through pedagogical experimentation, we aimed to create a collective context so that it was never about what individual children did, rather how we could invent together. 
Thinking With Materials 7
 The Arts as Mode of Inquiry 
 Our collective experimentations with materials emerged through our interest in 
the arts. In the “Material Encounters in Early Childhood Education” project, the arts were not superﬂ  uous additions, teacher-directed activities, or even ideal-ized examples of children’s inner worlds or creativity. Instead, they were seen as integral aspects of children’s daily inquiries, explorations, and learning. Art was a puzzle, a question, an encounter. As Claire Colebrook (2002) reminds us, like inquiry and research, 
 art is not about knowledge, conveying “meanings” or providing informa-
tion. Art is not just an ornament or style used to make data more palatable or consumable. Art may well have meanings or messages, but what makes it art is not its content but its  affect , the sensible force or style through 
which it produces content. 
 (pp. 24–25, emphasis in original) 
 Part of what art does is ask us to attend to things. It draws our attention, often 
to new things, or to older things said or presented in new ways. Basically, art asks us to make sense of things, or to ﬁ  gure them out. 
 As we mentioned earlier, integrating the arts into our project was not always 
easy. It is a commonly held misconception that art should be easy—that an 
artwork emerges effortlessly in a singular moment of inspiration, or that an artist knows the work in advance and an idea comes into his or her mind fully formed. There is often a large difference between an artist’s idea and the realization of that idea in paint, charcoal, or clay. The process of working through an idea is not straightforward, as if the materials merely illustrate a mental image; rather, there is a dynamic interaction of thought and image, and both are shaped in the process of creating. Shaun McNiff (2008), for example, writes: 
 Artistic inquiry, whether it is within the context of research or an indi-
vidual person’s creative expression, typically starts with the realization that you cannot deﬁ  ne the ﬁ  nal outcome when you are planning to do the 
work. . . . In the creative process, the most meaningful insights often come by surprise, unexpectedly, and even against the will of the creator. 
 (p. 40) 
 Art also relies on failures, mistakes, and disjunctures (Kind, 2007). As Alain 
Toumayayan (2004) describes, artistic inspiration is a “consequence of failure . . . 
an accomplishment which exceeds one’s powers of conception, planning and execution” (p. 93). Thus, to create is to step into the unknown with improvisa-tion at the heart of the endeavor. Failure, struggle, uncertainty, and not knowing the outcomes in advance were at times difﬁ  cult concepts for educators to embrace, 
yet these are essential elements of artistic practice. 
8 Thinking With Materials
 Drawing on the work of Guattari (1995) and Bennett (2010), Springgay and 
Rotas (2014) write about classroom art as more than giving children an oppor-
tunity to explore or to have a sensory experience: 
 In thinking a classroom as art, Guattari (1995) is not referring to institu-
tionalized art but to the ethico-aesthetic paradigm, where mutant composi-tions will “not simply attempt to preserve the endangered species of cultural life but equally to engender conditions for the creation and development of unprecedented formations of subjectivity that have never been seen and never felt” (p. 91). Disrupting reductive practices that enforce speciﬁ  c ways 
of doing curriculum (i.e., laws and codes), the classroom as art, as an ecology—an ethico-political enunciation—“is an activity of unframing” (p. 131); a way of living differently both in schools/life, but also differently living research, vital research “which refuses to dissolve completely into the milieu of human knowledge” (Bennett, 2010, p. 3). 
  (Springgay & Rotas, 2014, p. 563) 
 When art is understood materially, as an affective event, it becomes irreducible 
to function, form, and technique. In our project, it became a force of relations that made learning felt and inarticulable—in excess of language. As Springgay and Rotas put it, art became a social practice. Children were creating and were invited into thought. 
 The Studio 
 The art studio was an important element in our experimentations. The studio 
itself emerged and shifted through and with the project. It took many different forms and was created differently in each early childhood center at different times. In one center, we claimed a small area of a resource room that was con-nected to the early childhood education students’ classroom, and it became a dedicated studio space. In another center, we transformed the atrium into a studio. The forest became an art studio, as did a river. Y et, we never fully deﬁ  ned 
what the studio was supposed to be. We stayed close to the idea of “not yet.” We wanted to follow the rhythms and movements of the studio and wonder, What is the studio? rather than know in advance what it was or should be. Each studio evolved slowly. 
 In the studio, we questioned rather than accepted what things were. We asked, 
“What is (a) painting?” rather than trying to facilitate or plan painting projects. 
We held back for a while on an emphasis on what the marks and imagery repre-sented, and attended instead to how our understanding and perception of the processes could be enlarged and altered. We wondered: When does a painting begin? When does it end? What are the rituals, rhythms, and tempo of painting? 
 And we experimented, sometimes rather wildly, with materials. We spent 
months in intense experimentation with charcoal, encounters that connected
