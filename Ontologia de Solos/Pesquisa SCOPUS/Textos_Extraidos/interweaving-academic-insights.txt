Abstract
Purpose –Effective knowledge management in large academic institutions is crucial for fostering innovation
and improving educational practices. However, these institutions often face challenges, such as datafragmentation, siloed information systems and the complexity of integrating different data sources fromvarious departments with complex hierarchical structures. To address these problems, the authors proposed a
data fabric strategic framework that improves and enhances knowledge management by leveraging ontologies
and knowledge graphs. This study aims to investigate the potential of knowledge graphs, ontologicalknowledge modelling and knowledge representation to improve knowledge management in large academicinstitutions. It also describes how technology can enhance knowledge accessibility and exchanges and
improve decision-making processes based on insights from complex educational systems.
Design/methodology/approach –This study uses coordination theory as a foundational framework to
analyse intricate data systems in preparation for constructing, the Wizard of Oz method to facilitate thesystematic organisation and management of information and the execution of an ontology-based data fabricframework and knowledge graphs. The authors propose a data fabric strategic framework aimed at improving
knowledge management by leveraging ontologies and knowledge graphs.
Findings –Theﬁnal evaluation demonstrates that this approach effectively breaks down data silos, promotes
research collaboration and improves decision-making processes in large academic settings, offering solution-oriented data fabric technologies applicable to universities and university federations globally.
Practical implications –The proposed system provides a more ef ﬁcient way of managing and connecting
fragmented academic resources, improving accessibility for both learners and educators. By interconnecting
and streaming knowledge management process, the system can reduce not only operational costs but also
expenses on doing scienti ﬁc research.
Originality/value –Academic institutions prioritise time ef ﬁciency when acquiring vital data for improved
scienti ﬁc results. This emphasis extends beyond data governance to focus on how collective intelligence might
improve organisational performance. The academic community has enhanced data utilisation through the
implementation of data fabric technologies to improve data accessibility and data line tracking.

1. Introduction
Data and information management are undergoing a rapid transformation as a result of
advanced technologies. Srivastava (2023) highlighted the shift from big data to generative
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), emphasising that digital transformation involves 80% people and
20% technology. Institutions are leveraging new technologies and human expertise to extractinsights from diverse data sources, revealing their technical infrastructure and businessecosystems. Klaus Schwab ’s, (2017) “Fourth Industrial Revolution ”describes the
convergence of virtual and physical domains; this has fostered collective intelligence andtransformed knowledge management (KM) in academia. Strategic data management anddata fabric concepts are essential for harnessing this growing trend, driving breakthroughs ineducational practices and paradigms. Many large academic institutions that encompassvarious universities, research institutes and departments operating under a single structureface unique challenges in KM. Vietnam National University at Hanoi (VNU), one such
institution, is therefore considered a federation of universities. Consequently, each member
university/institute formally operates with single and sometimes isolated autonomy, resultingin disparate information systems and siloed data management repositories across the VNU.This data fragmentation hinders ef ﬁcient information and knowledge exchanges as well as
collaboration opportunities, hampering the federation ’s ability to support research
capabilities, foster innovation and enhance overall academic performance.
Ontologies provide a framework to identify and display concepts, entities, nodes and
interactions within knowledge domains ( Luo, 2023 ;Rakhra et al. , 2022 ). Knowledge graphs
(KGs) have the potential to transform KM in academic institutions by enabling the capture,understanding, inter-relationship, categorisation, utilisation and strati ﬁcation of massive
amounts of data. They facilitate the integration of semi-structured and unstructured dataacross hierarchical structures, making the disseminated knowledge within large businessesmore accessible and searchable.
Characterised as the “new oil ”in the World Economic Forum study and accompanying
the AI leadership report, data calls for actionable and insightful information ( Forum ,2022,
2019 ). In the context of managing knowledge in complex academic settings, ontology is a
key tool for encoding descriptions of semantic relationships between entities and nodes(DeBellis and Dutta, 2022 ;Lokala et al., 2022 ;Malik et al., 2021 ). By leveraging ontologies
and KGs, together with a data strategic framework, university federations can overcome thechallenges posed by autonomous operations and siloed systems, thereby enhancingknowledge sharing, collaborations and decision-making processes across the federation.
Research challenges: The integration of such structures into higher institutions presents
several challenges:
Modelling knowledge from member units ’unprocessed information systems is not
consistent. Different systems exhibit contextual operational knowledge. Researchmodelling differs from university knowledge modelling. First, huge enterprises/state-owned entities must address KM research.
Data exchange is cumbersome and unneeded because university federation memberscontrol business data domestically. For instance, training management systemsrequire learner tuition expenditures, not ﬁnancial data. Business system data must be
aggregated and provided proactively.
Knowledge exploitation and sharing culture require both technical solutions and
organisational tactics to stimulate not only big organisations but also university
federations.DLP

Contribution highlights : In response to the challenges, this study aims to enhance KM by
taking a structured data architecture approach and modelling knowledge using ontologiesand KGs. The comprehensive discussion on the strategic data framework VNU data fabric-
based knowledge management platform (vDFKM), which we proposed in our preliminary
work and presented at the International Conference on Computational CollectiveIntelligence conference (
Lan and Nguyen, 2023 ), is a crucial contribution. In this study, we
propose an in-depth extension to include not only technological solutions but also
organisational strategies to overcome knowledge exchange barriers, emphasising humanelements, technological procedures and the maximisation of academic knowledge
applications. Our key contributions are summarised below.
Proposing a method of modelling knowledge using KG-powered active metadata
combined with ontologies methodologies. Addressing the issue of knowledge
diversity in representing and modelling is crucial to develop a uni ﬁed knowledge
ontology that serves as a prevalent language across different departments, schoolsand disciplines. To put it another way, this ontological structure should be ﬂexible
enough to accommodate the majors and speci ﬁcities of diverse domains while
maintaining interoperability and coherence in modelling knowledge.
Proposing an advanced data sharing and synthesis approach: Sharing data within
organisations is always challenging and requires an intelligent data governance
framework that not only regulates access but also supports smart synthesis of relevant
data for information end users and related stakeholders. This process involves, ﬁrstly,
the development of a smart data ﬁlter and synthesis algorithm to decisively determine
the relativity and necessity of a data sharing scheme within a given school ’ss y s t e m .T o
be more speci ﬁc, this process leverages machine learning to train and learn from past
data sharing processes and establish a new synthesis pattern, enhancing the decision-
making process regarding what data needs to be shared in which format, particularly inrelation to data privacy and ethical considerations.
Promoting knowledge sharing culture: Enhancing the extent to which knowledge is
used and shared among various units within a university federation is possible
through the promotion of a collaborative culture and the application oftechnological advancements that enable seamless knowledge transfer. In addition to
technological solutions, this calls for adopting organisational tactics that promote
information sharing and implementing a centralised knowledge hub that facilitatesthe accessibility of knowledge objects from all units through aggregation,
categorisation and indexing. Furthermore, incorporating incentive mechanisms to
promote active participation and effective utilisation of the information hub is time-
and resource-intensive.
Using a Strategic Data Fabric Framework, speci ﬁcally vDFKM, for management
purposes: In addition to addressing the technological facets of data fusion and KM,the strategic data fabric framework should also include the organisational obstacles
that impede the ef ﬁcient exchange of knowledge regarding technological,
procedural and human elements.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces some fundamentaltheory and related works in knowledge integration and management. Section 3 covers the
methodology and research design. Section 4 presents our proposed method. Section 5
discusses and evaluates our proposed work. Finally, Section 6 summarises our contributionsand outlines potential future endeavours.Digital Library

2. Background and related works
The optimal realisation of the vision and mission objectives relies on the implementation of a
strategic plan that successfully manages and leverages the huge information resources of the
business and knowledge management system (KMS), given its unique set of features ( Murali
and Anouncia, 2022 ;Osman et al.,2 0 2 2 ;Sohrabi et al., 2019 ;Tudorache, 2020 ;Wang et al.,
2023 ).
The construction of ontological structures represents a pivotal element in managing the
deluge of information prevalent in modern educational settings ( Mora et al. , 2022 ;Rezaei
et al. ,2 0 2 1 ). Ontologies serve as semantic networks, providing structured and orientated
graphs that represent classes, concepts and the relationships between them. This structurebecomes crucial in an environment characterised by information overload and thedisconnection of vast, varied data ( Zhuet al. , 2018 ). Gruber ’sd eﬁnition of ontology as “an
explicit speci ﬁcation of a conceptualization ”(Gruber, 1993 ) underscores ontology ’s role in
forming, connecting and formalising knowledge across various disciplines ( Ferilli et al. ,
2022 ;Louet al., 2020 ).
Data fabric, together with ontologies, offers a uni ﬁed data management environment that
enables real-time, secure access to data from multiple sources ( IBM, 2023a ). Gartner, a
leading research and advisory company, emphasises the importance of enriching the data
fabric with administrative and management data, transforming it into a comprehensive KM
tool ( Mark and Ehtisham, 2020 ). The integration of data fabric with ontological structures
and KGs effectively captures and organises knowledge, simplifying stakeholder accessibilityand utilisation ( Chen et al., 2018 a;Jawad et al., 2023 ).
Our prior work has explored the conceptual model of university KM via a data fabric
approach, highlighting its ef ﬁcacy in information creation and presentation ( Lan and
Nguyen, 2023 ). This model addresses the fragmented nature of data in large educational
institutions, offering a pathway to cohesive and interconnected KM.
KGs, as introduced by Google in 2012, further enhance this landscape ( Daiet al. , 2022 ;
Liet al. ,2 0 2 1 ). KGs structure data into entities and relationships, creating networks that
render knowledge accessible and comprehensible to both humans and machines. The utility
of KGs extends to diverse applications, including knowledge retrieval, question-answeringand content recommendation ( Jiet al. ,2 0 2 2 ;Peng et al. , 2023 ;Pietrasik and Reformat,
2023 ). Numerous academic disciplines have extensively investigated and implemented KGs,
signiﬁcantly enhancing KM, data integration and educational environments. In the context of
educational data management, Chen created KnowEdu, an automated system for creating
educational KGs ( Chen et al. , 2018 b). This system enhanced the precision and ef ﬁcacy
of educational content delivery and personalised learning experiences by using data frompedagogical and educational assessments. Wang et al. (2023) proposed a framework for the
application of knowledge mapping and data visualisation techniques to genealogical data.The framework uses KGs to organise and illustrate complex information. Chughtai et al.
(2020) introduced an ontology-based article recommendation model that signi ﬁcantly
enhances the process of identifying suitable reviewers for academic papers, with an emphasison enhancing academic research through KGs. This model applies KGs to improve academicworkﬂows by matching articles with reviewers and by using latent semantic analysis and
entropy measures. The quality and predictive capabilities of data-driven models in research
are enhanced using KGs to forecast absent uncertainties in experimental data in other
instances. In addition, KGs are used to facilitate institutional KM and interdisciplinarystudies. The integration of KGs into a variety of sources was emphasised by Zeng et al.
(2023) andSenthil Kumaran and Latha (2023) to enhance the safety and improve their
accuracy and ef ﬁciency.DLP

In various industries, the ontological approach has been instrumental. Amazon Neptune ’s
support for Resource Description Framework (RDF) exempli ﬁes this utility in managing
ontological data ( Amazon, 2023 ). Thomson Reuters ’Open Calais initiative, which leverages
natural language processing and machine learning, uses ontologies for organising semanticmetadata ( Reuter, 2007 ). These applications highlight the versatility of ontologies in
organising, analysing and retrieving domain-speci ﬁc information.
Despite these advancements, KM in higher education and its scienti ﬁc application
continue to face challenges, particularly in the management of data silos. Effective KMsystems require a uni ﬁed structure where data fabric and other applications bolster data
strategies and dissemination (
Dawande et al. , 2023 ). This approach has demonstrated
potential in various sectors, from software testing in the military ( Gao et al. , 2022 )t o
ontology-based frameworks in agriculture ( Murali and Anouncia, 2022 ). The Industry 4.0
revolution further emphasises the need for data-driven, interoperable solutions, as seen ininitiatives like InPro ( Yang et al. , 2023 ) and Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based
ontologies in the aerospace sector ( Daiet al., 2022 ).
Ontology has been extensively explored across many disciplines and interdisciplines, as
seen in Table 1 andFigure 1 . This strategy has helped develop data distillation, linkage and
structure, enhanced geographic information systems and health-care decision-making andadvanced political science. The merging of natural language processing and large language
models has strengthened this method. Ontological frameworks render implicit knowledge
machine-readable, improving data processing ef ﬁciency. Data discovery is better understood
and contextualised when metadata is supplemented and integrated with ontologies, entitiesand nodes.
In conclusion, the integration of data fabrics, ontologies and KGs can improve academic
data management and presentation, aiding decision-making and KM system optimisation.
The proliferation of ontology-based frameworks across several areas signi ﬁes progress
towards more sophisticated, context-sensitive systems. Such systems help organise anddistribute specialised knowledge and inspire innovative decision support and predictive
analytics methods.
3. Methodology and research design
3.1 Methodology
The research uses ontological structures, coordination theory (
Crowston, 1997 ) and the
Wizard of Oz (WOZ) to facilitate the systematic organisation and management of
information within the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, VNU, Hanoi.Coordination theory helps ﬁgure out who is responsible for what in data management ( Ding
et al. , 2023 ;Kazantsev et al. ,2 0 2 3 ) and how they depend on each other. Ontological
structures add a semantic layer to how data are shown.
Coordination theory application: This theory guides the organisation ofcommunication channels and work ﬂows within the university, ensuring ef ﬁcient task
management and information sharing.
Ontological structure: This de ﬁnes key academic concepts and relationships,
enhancing understanding and functionality of the overall university ’s information
systems. This structure enhances data integration and accessibility across various
schools and departments, supporting better KM and decision-making.
WOZ is used to simulate the functionality and interactions of the proposedontological structure and for testing and re ﬁning how data are managed and accessed
within the tested system ( Schlögl et al. , 2015 ).Digital Library

3.2 Research design
This study proposes a general methodology that integrates a strategic data fabric KM
approach with existing digital repository systems to address the challenges of knowledge
modelling, fragmentation and user accessibility within large academic institutions and
university federations. The approach includes aligning the ontologies of the data fabricframework with the current data formats of the systems, such as DSpace, to ensurecomprehensive knowledge representation and data integration. The development and testingphrases include mapping and aligning the ontological structures with the metadata schemes
of digital repositories, followed by pilot testing to assess the effectiveness and ef ﬁciency of
the integration.
To validate the proposed method, a case study is chosen by applying this approach to the
academic and scienti ﬁc data of a university federation. We chose the University of Social
Sciences and Humanities, a division of VNU, for this case study to pinpoint the challenges
and advantages associated with the integration of the new system, while also providing
contextual and semantic suggestions for alternative knowledge management systems. Theinsights gained from this proposed framework and its validation will help in re ﬁning the
methodology and demonstrating its practical applicability to other institutions seeking toenhance their KM practices.
The practical implementation steps are the following:
Task identi ﬁcation and division: Identifying key tasks and dividing them among
involved stakeholders.

Ontology development: Creating ontologies and integrating them into Neo4j, which
deﬁnes academic concepts and relationships.
Work ﬂow design: Designing work ﬂows to optimise data management processes.
Pilot implementation: Testing the integrated system.
Monitoring and feedback.
Systematic re ﬁnement based on feedback and performance metrics.
4. Knowledge management approaches and proposed method
4.1 Ontological reasoning in data fabric and knowledge graph-enhanced knowledge
management architecture
To effectively implement the ontological reasoning in the Data Fabric and KG-Enhanced
KM architecture described in this section, it is essential to engage all stakeholders, including
lecturers, students and administrators within our institution. By aligning with speci ﬁc
informational demands and institutional needs, stakeholders ensure that ontological
knowledge models are comprehensive and applicable. Therefore, our ontology includes both
academic and administrative domain knowledge. This architecture not only addressesinstitutional knowledge needs but also bolsters stakeholder engagement in KM.
Adopting common ontology standards: Ontology, in this context, is more than a
methodology, it is a transformative tool for interpreting and representing data in a machine-readable format. Within academic settings, such as VNU for instance, ontologies are
constructed by de ﬁning terms and concepts and enriching them semantically. This ontology
could encompass core entities and enhance nodes and edge development in academic
settings, such as courses, research projects, publications, faculty, students and administrative
processes, each with de ﬁned properties and relationships. The integration of business
semantics using ontology escalates to standardise descriptions across data architecture
components. For example, subject-predicate-object format are used to describe relationshipsin its academic and administrative data, enhancing consistency in data presentation and
improves interoperability among different departments.
This enrichment adds depth and contextual precision: Understanding research impact,
citation networks, student performance trends or course relevancy across different programs;
deﬁning entities, properties and relationships; and enabling the extraction of meaningful
conclusions from explicit data within the Data Fabric framework and KG structures. This
context awareness building can assist in strategic decision-making in areas such as
curriculum development, research collaboration or even research funding allocation. As
illustrated in Figure 2
, the integration of ontology and KG representations allows for the
emergence of new academic insights and the discovery of implicit knowledge. The ontologycurrently in use incorporates a shared vocabulary and a set of governing rules. In this context,
ontologies help ensure data quality by making implicit knowledge explicit. An academic
institution can use ontologies to establish relationships and constraints that ensure high
quality in not only student records but also research outputs and administrative databases;
this approach facilitates the standardisation of data input formats and minimises the
occurrence of errors.
Typically, we specify these rules using RDF Schema and OWL. This study integrates
Neo4j into the vDFKM framework. While this technology does not explicitly support certain
logical rules layers such as Semantic Web Rule Language, Rule Interchange Format and
SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language Inferencing Notation and even though it doesprovide some interference capabilities, its interference capabilities are implemented throughDigital Library

custom Cypher queries and Awesome Procedures on Cypher procedures, deriving
meaningful relationships and insights from data. We selected Neo4j as the underlyingtechnology for our KG implementation in this study for four key reasons, each offeringseveral practical advantages, as outlined below:
(1) The nature of academic se ttings and databases comes from diverse sources
across several departments, disciplines and majors. Unlike traditional relationaldatabases, Neo4j can manage, query about and represent complex relationshipswithin data. It allows for more direct querying and visualisation regardingcomplex data structures, resulting in more ef ﬁcient relationship management.
(2) Performance and scalability: Neo4j ef ﬁciently manages large-scale graph data,
delivering high performance in read and extraction operations. This makes Neo4j
Figure 2. General architecture of vDFKM –data fabric-based knowledge management platformDLP
41,1
30
particularly suitable for applications that require real or near-real time data access
and updates, which are essential for managing the growing academic databases atthe institution.
(3) Contextual richness: Neo4j can bring out and connect the data set ’s rich context and
relationships. This makes it relatively good at ﬁnding and managing connections
between different academic resources, improving the KG ’s overall understanding,
usefulness and accessibility.
(4) Extensibility and ﬂexibility: Neo4j ’s schema-free nature allows for ﬂexible and
dynamic data/knowledge modelling, crucial for integrating diverse data sourceswithout necessitating signi ﬁcant restructuring. In subsection 4.3, we will delve
deeper into this concept by presenting a case study that uses metadata from the
university ’s digital library databases to represent a KG, illustrated in
Figure 3 as a
sample.
Academic institutions can create a structured knowledge base using ontologies to not onlycapture academic knowledge but also to help the institution in retaining it. This ability toreason and draw conclusions makes KGs more useful by making them better at givingcontextually relevant suggestions and performing complicated data analyses whereunderstanding the context and semantic relationships is important.

4.2 Why knowledge graphs? Tracking data lineage at academic institution
IBM (2023b) deﬁned data lineage as “the methodology that elucidates the journey of data
through its lifecycle, illuminating its origins, modi ﬁcations and ultimate disposition within a
data pipeline ”. This concept is particularly pertinent within the realms of academia, where
data proliferation ( Sikos and Philp, 2020 ;Soedarmadji et al. , 2019 ) is common due to the
multitudes of originating sources. A complex academic institution, such as VNU, whichconsists of 9 schools, more than 35 departments and many connected organisations,
contributes to a rich tapestry of data through various transformations and channels.
Understanding VNU ’s complicated data linkages helps with data management and lineage.
From collection and analysis to integration, the university ’s hierarchy complicates data
mosaic management. This complexity necessitates the updating and contextualisation of data
to maintain relevance. This strategy increases data lineage modelling and understandingwhile maintaining semantic integrity.
Gartner (2023) highlighted the advancement of KGs, particularly their capacity to
elucidate knowledge in synergy with generative AI, machine learning and large languagemodels. Within this framework, KGs serve as a sophisticated mechanism to organise,
interlink and exhibit knowledge in a structured format, comprising nodes and relational
edges. This graphical representation not only makes it easier to understand complex andunstructured data but also makes it much easier to see how data came to be, thus aiding in the
complicated process of data interpretation and analysis.
Figure 4 displays a screenshot of a current metadata record from our university
library, speci ﬁcally describing the materials titled “Vietnam: A Country Study ”.T h i s
record serves as an example of how we plan to deconstruct and extract key information,such as the author, title, publication data and subject headings. We will then use this
extracted metadata to construct a Knowledge Group (KG) within Neo4J, thereby
demonstrating the transformation of traditional metadata into a more dynamic andinterconnected data structure.
Deconstructing metadata: This process involves identifying key entities such as author,
title, year of publication and other related content descriptions, including LCCN, onlineformats and subject headings.
Creating nodes and relationships: Although the current metadata is based on library
standards such as Dublin Core, it remains static and lacks interconnectedness. In
Neo4j, we elevate this metadata by representing each entity as a node andestablishing relationships between them, such as linking the titles, authors andpublishers. This transforms the metadata from isolated entries into a dynamic,
interconnected network, providing richer context and uncovering hidden
relationships. This enhancement signi ﬁcantly improves the user ’s ability to explore
and interpret the material within a broader, interconnected information framework.
For example, the “book ”node is linked to the “author ”node with an “Author_by ”
relationship and to the “publisher ”node with a “published_by ”relationship.
Using Cypher queries in Neo4j.
Enhancing visualisation: Figure 4 involves adding more nodes and relationships to
present other relevant described elements as well as documents and theirconnections. We could illustrate this by transforming the static image into a dynamic
graph that displays the correlations.
Visualising the KG: As an example, the result in Figure 4 shows the structure of
relationships between various entities.DLP
41,1
32
At some point, the complexity of a graph can indeed become overwhelming as the number of
nodes increases. For example, a graph with 12 nodes ( Figure 5 ) and the speci ﬁcations
initially presented in Figure 5 offers a clear and manageable visual that allows for a detailed
exploration of relationships and connections. However, as the graph expands to 39 nodes or
more, the visualisation gets increasingly complex and challenging to interpret. To mitigatethis, we can implement strategies such as ﬁltering redundant nodes, aggregating similar

33
nodes and relationships and using metadata to reduce visual clusters while preserving
essential contextual information. This approach ensures that, even as the data set grows, theKGs continue to serve as valuable tools for understanding the complexity of data structures.Moreover, the VNU Library and Digital Knowledge Centre is now using Dublin Core –based
metadata to describe our materials and transferring from Dublin Core to a KG format
signiﬁcantly enhances our ability to explore context-speci ﬁc data. Unlike the static nature of
Dublin Core, KGs provide a dynamic, frequently updated and interconnected representationof data, allowing for the discovery of hidden relationships and deeper contextual insights.
This transition is crucial for organising, managing and understanding the rich, multifaceted
data within academic environments such as VNU.
Breaking data silos with this KG lets organisations share information more effectively.
Context creates knowledge, according to Linet al. (2023) ;Peng et al. (2023) ;Wuet al.
(2023) ; and Zhong et al. (2023) . This dynamic visualisation offers a wide variety of
perspectives to satisfy users ’goals and job-speci ﬁc information demands. The KG is vital for
preserving the Vietnam War ’s legacy and understanding its repercussions on society and
beyond.
4.3 Trustworthy with data strategic framework
The creation and deployment of ontologies are key to our data management strategy
(illustrated in Figure 6 ), facilitating the effective organisation of academic library
data for stakeholders. This approach enhances the library data lake, streaming of data
collection and user engagement at VNU. We prioritise relevant, well-organised metadatato capture semantic richness.
Figure 6 illustrates the data journey and simpli ﬁes
metadata maintenance. In this case, KGs aid in data pattern recognition and lineageanalysis. The system integrates structured and unstructured data, offering machine- and
human-friendly formats.
The proposed vDFKM framework consists of eight key components, each playing a
crucial role in managing and enriching academic data, as detailed below:
Data acquisition : Capturing physical or digital materials and extracting essential
metadata, including titles, authors and publication information.
Figure 5. Detailed cyphers and graph in the context of Vietnam as a countryDLP
41,1
34
Metadata generation : Producing descriptive, administrative and technical metadata,
ensuring comprehensive cataloguing and standardisation.
Data transformation and enrichment : Enhancing and standardising data to conform
to library standards (in this case, Dublin Core) while adding value through additionalcontextual information.
Ontology development and data lineage documentation : Ensuring ontology-based
data structuring, tracking transformations and implementing version control to
maintain data accuracy and historical integrity.
Data integration into data lake : Organising and structuring data in a centralised
repository for ef ﬁcient access and governance, harnessing a semantic or ontology-
based layer.
Data utilisation and accessibility : Facilitating access to the integrated data through
user-friendly interfaces and search tools, providing analytics and discoveryfunctions.
Maintenance and monitoring : Continuously monitoring data quality, incorporating
feedback loops to improve accuracy and updating archival policies.
Compliance and security : Ensuring data privacy, security and compliance with legal
standards, protecting data from unauthorised access.
These components are interlinked within the vDFKM framework, supporting data integrity
and enrichment, thus ensuring that the entire data ﬂow from acquisition to utilisation is not
only ef ﬁcient but also secure and accurate.

5. Experiments and evaluation
To validate the effectiveness and capability of our proposed method, the project is now
deployed currently at our VNU Library and Digital Knowledge Centre (VNU-LDKC) toaddress the following research questions:
RQ1. How does the ontological structure accommodate and represent the diversity of
knowledge domains across various academic disciplines/inter-disciplines at acomplex academic institution such as VNU?
RQ2. Is the KG-based method of modelling data from the business systems of member
units adequate and effective for enhancing the performance of knowledgemodelling in large-scale organisations?
RQ3. How does the vDFKM platform, with its data fabric design, enhance the ef ﬁcacy
of knowledge aggregation, sharing and mining operations based on activemetadata from business systems in various organisational units?
RQ4. What ethical and legal factors must an academic institution consider when using
data fabric for data and KM and how can these be addressed?
5.1 Deployment model of vDFKM
To answer RQ3, a prototype of the vDFKM platform was implemented at VNU. With the KM
requirements described in Section 4, vDFKM was piloted with VNU-LDKC as the managementfocal point. Figure 7
depicts the vDFKM deployment architecture at VNU. Based on the vDFKM

platform, operational systems at each member university can integrate and share data and
knowledge. In the data lakehouse of vDFKM, all aggregated data from business systems of VNU
member units will be centrally handled. The vDFKM platform handles data gathering, integration,knowledge modelling, sharing, coordination and administration for all active metadata.
For deployment of vDFKM, we experimentally installed this open-source platform;
speciﬁcally, the complete Runtime and Data Infrastructure component is deployed via
Kubernetes (runtime - https://kubernetes.io/ ) and Delta Lakehouse ( https://delta.io ). The
coordination of KM operations is based on the expansion of functions from the open-source
framework Kamu-Data ( https://github.com/kamu-data ).

All vDFKM functions are delivered as microservices through Rest APIs. Moreover, we offer
these functions as a FaaS (Function as a Service) service via the open-source platform Serverless(
https://github.com/serverless/serverless ). Primary tools of vDFKM are illustrated in Figure 8 .
5.2 DSpace integration with data fabric framework
Figure 9 depicts the two stages of data integration into a KG. The following is a list of some
of the frequent events and scenarios that foster interdisciplinary research and knowledgetransfer between departments and schools:
Teachers and students can collaborate on projects and share annotated resource lists
via this pipeline at VNU. Teachers and students can also incorporate email and social
media for updates and recommendations. Students researched the vDFKM platformand used Neo4J KGs in DSpace for intuitive learning maps (
Figure 4 ).

5.3 Evaluation and discussion
VNU ’s system can customise ontological data fabric frameworks to accommodate the
requirements of lecturers, students and administrators. This approach leverages data fabrictechnologies (KGs for real-time insights), overcoming traditional database limitations, thus

answering RQ1. Tracking data generation and use ensures data integrity. The semantic layer
helps stakeholders navigate and understand diverse data sets, optimising KM across theinstitution ( Figure 8
). VNU uses a strategic data framework to analyse and integrate library
items, research data and curriculum, thereby bridging information gaps in higher education.This framework maximises data value, emphasises user trust, uses agile processes andensures careful data management for effective data tracking. However, we have wellacknowledged that the current implementation has primarily been tested on bibliographicmetadata, which is a speci ﬁc subset of the university ’s overall data landscape. The research ’s
initial initiative focus has allowed the team to develop and validate the foundational elementsof KG and data fabric technologies. As the study progresses, we recognise the importance ofextending this system to encompass a wider range of data sets (all belonging to schools anddepartments), including administrative, curricular and research data, to address the broaderneeds of all stakeholders at VNU. Future work will involve integrating additional ontologicalframeworks and enhancing the system ’s semantic capabilities to fully capture and realise its
potential in addressing the complex and diverse requirements of the university environment.In addition, the development of upgraded features, including the integration of localVietnamese academic databases and the use of Linked Data technologies, will be thoroughlyexplored to further enhance the system ’s functionality and interoperability.
The VNU-LDKC is just starting to implement and share expertise at universities. This
shows that the current mechanism for sharing knowledge among colleges is continuallyevolving. The fact that it is still in its early stages indicates that work needs to be done toimprove and expand the system. Thus, academic exchange of information, ideas andresearch discoveries remains nascent and may not be optimal. The communication andapplication of information at the collegiate level can be further improved.
Regarding RQ2 andRQ3, leveraging KGs to represent and model knowledge could be
promising for large, hierarchical organisations such as VNU, and the ability to capturecomplex relationships using nodes and relationships has improved research collaboration,facilitated data-driven insights and fostered in-depth discussions to overcome the oldersystem ’s limitations. Implementing vDFKM is a novel technique to update the KMS. It
reveals operational ef ﬁciencies acquired through time-consuming research and helps the
VNU make actionable decisions.
Ethical and legal considerations ( RQ4) are important in KMS implementation. Barriers to
data privacy, AI algorithmic bias and intellectual property infringement are the majorconcerns. The frameworks cover data strategies, lineage and monitoring, but VNU uses datafabric technologies to comply with local and international data protection laws. Throughoutthe deployment, the ethical and legal perspectives of students, faculty and administratorswere carefully considered.
6. Conclusions
Theﬁndings of this research have laid a strong foundation for KM not only in university
federations, where embracing and implementing data fabric transformation is crucial andsigniﬁcant. In the future, the outlined directions could strengthen the empirical grounding
framework to broaden the contextual applicability. By addressing these challenges, thisresearch aiming at improving knowledge sharing and management not only revolutioniseshow organisations manage and share but also expands the possibilities for using and reusingthe knowledge. Future plans include expanding research collaboration among academicinstitutions, integrating diverse data sources with a focus on interoperability and enhancingthe semantic capabilities of knowledge sharing and management systems. By embracingDigital Library

these technologies, universities can strengthen interconnected ecosystems that support
lifelong learning and interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research.
This strategic vision leverages technological advancement, signifying a paradigm shift in
academia ’s roles in societies. By using data fabric technologies, institutions can set up
effective KM systems and foster a lifelong learning community, thereby enriching the
educational landscape.
