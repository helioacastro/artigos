Maize ’s irrigation knowledge ABSTRACT  
The demand for relevant information in a timely manner portrays the significance of knowledge management in 
all areas of lives; for instance, agriculture. To this end, soils, fertilizers and irrigation as agronomic concepts are 
essential knowledge inputs for any crops, such as maize. Conversely, there is always difficulty in timely retrieval 
of these relevant information owing to the unstructured nature of data in repositories, and complexity of con-
cepts mismatch. Sequel to this development, ontology, a semantic data modeling technique is promising as it has 
been recently employed to deal with these challenges across different domains. However, the robustness of 
ontology, in terms of semantic expressivity of hidden knowledge, and autonomous growth of ontology leave 
some gaps to contend with. In view of this development, this research aims to design a robust OWL Rule based 
ontology for maize crop domain by considering primarily soils, fertilizers and irrigation agronomic concepts 
capable to evolve autonomously. The proposed ontology herein christened MaCOnto , is developed using the 
adapted six steps ontology-engineering principle. Over 1,430 entities are encoded in OWL; eighty Competency 
Questions (CQs) validated by domain experts are modeled in FOL, and implemented as rules via SWRL. Thus, the 
ontology is queried by SQWRL. Besides, the novel algorithmic design for the ontology to autonomously evolve is 
implemented in Java environment by employing WordNet. The results obtained from structural based evaluation 
show an outstanding performance across the eight metrics. Similarly, the results of the competency-based 
evaluation are also promising. Therefore, the proposed MaCOnto is a robust application based ontology 
capable to infer and responds to user’s query based on its contextual information.   
1.Introduction 
Maize (Zea mays L.), widely referred to as corn is arguably one of the 
economic viable cereal crops. While, in most developing nations, maize 
serves as staple food like rice or wheat (Badmus & Ariyo, 2011 ); in 
developed climes, it serves as feed for animals and also a significant raw 
materials for production industries; such as biofuels energy (¯Sarauskis 
et al., 2014 ). Therefore, considering these aforementioned importance 
of the crop, the rationale for its choice as knowledge domain in this 
research is justified. More so, according to Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization of United Nations (FAO), Soils, Fertilizers and Irrigation 
knowledge are essential agricultural inputs for any crop, and specif -
ically, maize. Soils type for maize crop may determine the choice of ir-
rigation ’s method; as amount of moisture or irrigation water affects the growth of maize (Fang & Su, 2019 ; Hazman, 2015 ; Mohanraj et al., 
2018 ). Similarly, the nature of nutrient presence in soil also determines 
the volume and ingredient of fertilizers to apply (Ding et al., 2010 ). 
These scenarios partly formed the competency questions considered in 
this research. The Consultative Group on International Agriculture 
Research (CGIAR) ’ proposal of 2017 – 2022 carried on maize crop, re-
ported the important of soils on the crop ’s growth. Similarly, fertilizer as 
an essential input of crop is described according to FAO as next to water. 
It is mostly available in various contents and ingredients for example, 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. More so, when there is inadequacy 
of rainfall or moisture, an alternative water source – irrigation becomes 
indispensable; more importantly, precision irrigation is required for the 
crop (Goumopoulos et al., 2014 ). 
No doubt that in this present age, the availability of all these

2knowledge about maize crop is not a challenge any longer; but to 
retrieve the relevant information in a timely and easier manner forms 
the challenge. This research problem is attributed to the unstructured 
nature of repositories and heterogeneous forms of data (Agyapong-Ko -
dua et al., 2013 ; Bonacin et al., 2016 ; Walisadeera et al., 2015 ). Besides, 
the ambiguity nature of natural languages in terms of synonyms and 
polysemy contributed to the problem of concepts mismatch (Fawei et al., 
2019 ). Hence, based on literature, ontology as a top-notch technology 
has proven to proffer solution across different knowledge areas. 
Ontology, a semantic data modeling technique is defined according to 
Gruber (1993) as an explicit and formal specification of shared con-
ceptualizations. Gruber also described ontology in four different forms. 
An ontology design based on a particular domain is described as domain 
based ontology. However, such ontology can be further modeled to 
perform certain defined activities via set of complex or technical ques-
tions called Competency Questions (CQs). Thus, such modified domain 
ontology is regarded as task ontology (Li et al., 2013 ); which may be 
otherwise known as application ontology (Park et al., 2012 ). Top-level 
ontology is generic in nature, because it does not necessarily conform 
to a particular knowledge area. 
To design a deep represented ontology, Web Ontology Language 
(OWL) (Alkhammash, 2020 ), which is a knowledge representation lan-
guage with high power of semantic expressivity is required. Besides, 
making ontology to be rule based by way of using Semantic Web Rule 
Language (SWRL) (Tang et al., 2018 ), significantly contributes to a huge 
effort desired for robust ontology. Consequently, OWL Rule (Gonz ˘alez 
et al., 2021 ) based ontology would be achieved. More importantly, the 
robustness of ontology could be further defined based on the level of 
Competency Questions (CQs) formulated and appropriately modeled by 
First-Order-Logic (FOL) (Alvez et al., 2017 ). In the end, Prot˘eg˘e (5.5.0) 
(Nandhinidevi et al., 2021 ), an ontology development application and 
editor has the required capacity to develop such level of ontology. 
More so, the use of WordNet, a lexical database similar in structure 
with ontologies (Jarrar, 2021 ), is promising. This is to achieve robust -
ness of the proposed ontology in terms of providing mechanism for the 
autonomous evolution. It is a lexical resource considered to be one of the 
global largest word collection corpuses that offers hierarchical structure 
of Synset (set of one or more synonyms), and semantic properties of 
every word (Chakravarthi et al., 2018 ; Uthayan & Mala, 2015 ). Thus, 
synonymy, antonymy, meronyms, hypernyms and hyponyms are ex-
amples of WordNet ’s semantic relations (Alobed et al., 2021 ). 
Therefore, this research aims to design an OWL Rule based appli -
cation ontology for maize crop considering primarily soils, fertilizers 
and irrigation knowledge christened herein as MaCOnto. Other knowl -
edge partly considered as validated by the domain experts include cli-
matic conditions, maize ’s pest and weeds treatments. This research is an 
extension of an earlier published works on ontology designed for soils 
and fertilizers knowledge of maize crop (Aminu et al., 2019 ); and SIM-
cOnto: an ontology designed for soils and irrigation knowledge of maize 
crop (Aminu et al., 2021b ). The domain part of the proposed MaCOnto is 
represented in OWL DL using prot˘eg˘e 5.5.0 based on the adapted six 
steps iterative ontology engineering principle (Aminu et al., 2020 ). The 
tasks part consists of eighty (80) CQs validated by experts, modeled 
using First-Order-Logic (FOL) and implemented via Semantic Web Rule 
Language (SWRL). In addition, the robustness of the ontology equally 
lies on the novel algorithmic design for its autonomous evolution le-
verages on WordNet. Similarly, robustness of ontology can be deter -
mined based on its performance level of evaluation. One of the 
promising evaluation techniques to validate the robustness is the 
structural based evaluation with its eight metrics (Sicilia et al., 2012 ). 
Therefore, MaCOnto is adjudged to be robust owing to the results from 
the evaluation. 
The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 presents some related literature of the domain under consider -
ation; and Section 3 presents the ontology engineering process. The 
proposed MaCOnto framework, and development of the ontology are accounted for in both Sections 4 and 5 respectively. While Section 6 
discusses the results; conclusion and suggested future work are pre-
sented in section 7. 
2.Related studies 
The research proposal of CGIAR on maize, which described the crop 
as C4 (Abdelgawad et al., 2021 ) crop hypothetically said that maize has 
a higher yield potential than rice and wheat. This is because it can grow 
across all seasons; it was projected to be the leading crop in year 2020. 
However, similar to any other knowledge areas, to retrieve relevant 
knowledge related to maize poses challenges as a result of unstructured 
data representation and the deficiency of retrieval mechanisms (Aminu 
et al., 2021a ; Fawei et al., 2019 ; Tulasi et al., 2017 ). In view of this, this 
section accounts for how ontology has been explored for knowledge 
representation and retrieval system; the challenges and future. 
Wimalanathan et al. (2018) implored a sequence based methods to 
produce a functional annotation of maize protein coding genes based on 
Gene Ontology (GO) (Ontology Gene Consortium, 2019 ) entities allo-
cation. Primarily, the study aimed at improving maize annotation of the 
existing phytozome and Gramene maize GO annotation set (Wimala -
nathan et al., 2018 ). However, the maize protein coding genes are 
structured as taxonomy classification system with metadata. It lacks 
semantic knowledge representation techniques; that is, no aspect of 
ontology modeling is considered in the classification system. 
The research work of Vincent et al. (2003) designed zea mays plant 
structure ontology database with the aid of Directed Acyclic Graph 
(DAG) Edits (Landgrebe, 2022 ) to aid knowledge sharing in terms of 
botanical terms classification along with abbreviated synonyms of 
terms. The plant ontology designed by the researchers (Vincent et al., 
2003) may be described as database for terms classification. In other 
words, concepts relationship were not explored based on inference. In 
the crop ontology of Shrestha et al. (2016) whose aim is to collect 
validated terms on anatomy, structure and phenotype of crops also with 
their relationship concepts; developed maize trait ontology as one of the 
crops using OBO-Edit (Karray et al., 2021 ). The research reported the 
significance of ontology to depict agronomic phenotypes terms as it offer 
structured data and thus enhance the retrieval of information. However, 
the ontology editor is no doubt limited in semantic expressivity; since 
the OBO-Edit version does not supports OWL knowledge representation. 
Therefore, the ontology output is deficient of formal computational 
definitions to other semantic based knowledge representations for 
effective information retrieval. Also concepts on soils formed less than 
five entities; knowledge on irrigations was not modeled. Similarly, the 
work of (Green et al., 2011 ) designed ontology by considering the 
retrieval of mutant phenotype information of maize gene only. 
Furthermore, the research of Ma et al. (2013) developed reasoning 
based ontology to diagnose maize diseases with the aid of OWL DL and 
Semantic Web Rule Language as maize diseases knowledge representa -
tion language and rule language respectively. However, the ontology 
developed is not pivoted on any defined methodology; and the maize 
information is limited to disease only. Similarly, Cao et al. (2013) 
equally developed maize ’s diseases diagnostic model based on ontology 
and algorithm for diagnosis. It is solely a domain-based ontology. 
The knowledge of appropriate soils, fertilizers, irrigation or any 
agricultural inputs to an appropriate crop has been giving research at-
tentions in a recent time by employing ontology, semantic data 
modeling technique to develop decision based system (Chougule et al., 
2019 ). Similarly, Car (2018) equally modeled a decision based ontology 
for irrigation knowledge. The researcher aimed to improve the decision 
system by paying attention to the concise relationship among the en-
tities of the ontology. Malik et al. (2018) developed ontology for the 
domain of agriculture but considering fertilizer knowledge. The re-
searchers anticipate in future integrating the knowledge with other 
related domain such as soils. More so, owing to the significance of soils 
knowledge in agriculture, the research work of (Heeptaisong & E.F. Aminu et al.

3Shivihok, 2012 ) designed an ontology based on soils domain to assist 
users in processing relevant information. 
In furtherance to the literature, the work of Cornejo et al. (2005) 
developed irrigation-based ontology aims to serve as learning guide for 
subsistence farmers. Following the Noy-McGuiness approach, the 
ontology was designed using a graph based ObjectEditor (Tsiakmaki & 
Hartonas, 2013 ). However, the editor for the ontology is highly 
restricted for complex knowledge representation. Consequently, the 
proposed system is limited in terms of inference capability. The hilly 
citrus ontology designed by Wang & Wang (2018) focuses on three 
heterogeneous knowledge which include irrigation and fertilizers. It was 
developed using TopBraidComposer editor (Khondoker & Mueller, 
2010 ) in the syntax of RDF and query in SPARQL. Considering the RDF 
technology, the ontology is limited to make detail semantic inferences. 
Finally, the research work of Aminu et al. (2019) modeled soils and 
fertilizers knowledge of maize crop ontologically based on the adopted 
methodology. However, the ontology developed did not consider veri-
fied CQs of the knowledge; and even though Hermit reasoner (Romero 
et al., 2012 ) validated the ontology, the overall performance was not 
evaluated. Similarly, Aminu et al. (2021b) equally designed an OWL 
Rule based ontology dubbed SIMcOnto by considering soils and irriga -
tion knowledge for the same crop. The same ontology development 
approach was explored considering it potentials to address complex 
questions and ontology evolution. However, the ontology was not 
evaluated to show its efficacy against the set standard of ontology 
content and construction evaluations. In conclusion, ontology can be 
adjudged as an effective semantic data modeling technique for complex 
knowledge representation such as agriculture domain Song et al. (2012) . 
Hence, the proposed application based ontology (MaCOnto) 
considered maize crop along with the essential agricultural inputs such 
as soils, fertilizers and irrigations, which are interoperable agronomic 
concepts. Similarly, unlike other review works in this section, the 
ontology is developed based on hybridized methodology, which 
uniquely includes the autonomous growth of the ontology. More so, the 
ontology is adjudged to be robust based on the satisfactory results of the 
evaluations. 
3.The MACOnto ’s ontology engineering process: the 
methodology 
Every standard ontology is developed based on a given engineering 
processes called methodology, which is similar to the iterative software 
development approaches. There are numbers of ontology development 
methodologies, but there is no standard or single correct methodology 
for ontology design (Kapoor & Kapoor, 2014 ; Noy & Mcguinness, 2001 ; 
Walisadeera et al., 2015 ). Consequently, this research adopted the hy-
bridized six steps iterative ontology design process shown in Fig. 1. The 
steps are collection of domain knowledge, terms specification of 
ontology, setting out competency questions, ontology formalisation, 
ontology evaluation, and ontology evolution (Aminu et al., 2020 ). 
The six activities (or steps) of harmonized Gruninger –Fox, Methontology and FAO based methodologies in Fig. 1 are described as 
an iterative ontology engineering process. This is because developer can 
easily loop back to any earlier implemented step if defect is noticed at 
any step. Therefore, the methodology for the development of the 
ontology (MaCOnto) is explained by the following steps. i. The first step 
in the development of MACOnto is the collection and analysis of domain 
knowledge; in this case, knowledge about maize crop itself, soils, fer-
tilizers and irrigation. Other related knowledge of maize collected as 
suggested by domain experts include climatic condition, farm imple -
ment, pest/insects and weed treatment. Terminological concepts were 
collected from various reliable information sources. This include 
research articles, authoritative online data sources, and published books 
from institutions such as International Maize and Wheat Improvement 
Center (CIMMYT), International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). 
Others are School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology (SAAT), 
Federal University of Technology, Minna and Institute for Agricultural 
Research (IAR), Zaria. More so, hundreds of CQs were collected via 
questionnaire however, after series of validation exercise by the team of 
domain experts, eighty CQs were satisfactorily used. The analysis of the 
knowledge is carried out manually following the middle-out-approach. 
The rationale behind the manual process is to ensure adequate 
involvement and participation of domain specialists. Besides, manual 
approach of ontology development is more reliable in terms of accuracy 
and precision when compare to available automatic processes, which 
have been proven inaccurate (Fawei et al., 2018 ). ii. The next step is 
specification of the knowledge terminologies analyzed from the previ -
ous step in accordance to OWL knowledge representation strategy. That 
is, the ontology ’s terms are specified as classes, properties (object and 
data) and individuals. The statistics of these OWL components starting 
from component classes, which include the default class of owl: Thing 
stands at 309. The total properties that is, object properties for relations 
and data properties for entity description stand at 619. Lastly, the in-
dividual component has a total number of 502 entities. In order to 
simplify the terms specified for domain experts, a knowledge modeling 
software called CMap tool (version 6.04) (Bonacin et al., 2016 ; Novak & 
Ca~nas, 2008 ) is employed in this research. It helps to stimulate the 
knowledge of the terms, and understanding between ontology de-
velopers and domain specialists. Each of the knowledge considered in 
this work has their terminologies specified. For example, sample of soils 
knowledge is presented in this paper using the CMap tool as shown in 
Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2 presents sample terms of some specified soils knowledge. The 
terms in oval shapes represent classes but the bolded terms represent 
individual ’s concepts. In this paper, the forward slash (/) in some of the 
oval shapes indicates that the terms are synonymous (for example, the 
term Soils is synonymous to SoilCondition and Edaphic_Requirements ) as 
additional attributes. Also the arrow stands for object properties. For 
instance, Loamy has SiltLoamSoil and Soil requiresFertilier Fertilizers . iii. 
Competency Questions (CQs) evidently distinguish ontology from other 
related knowledge representation models. The semantic contents of 
ontology largely have to do with its ability to handle the user query; in 
other word, to infer contextual knowledge of a given CQ. This step of the 
ontology development gives room for enforcement of logic and rules. In 
this research, there are 24, 23, 20 and 13 numbers of validated CQs for 
soils, fertilizers, irrigation and other supportive knowledge respectively. 
The supportive knowledge include but not limited to climatic condition 
and pest/insects. The reduction to the initial number of CQs is necessi -
tated because of repetitions of some questions by almost all the re-
spondents. Similarly, subject granularity is another factor that led to the 
reduction during CQs validation by experts; this is to revolve the 
ontology within its scope and purpose. First Order Logic (FOL) is 
exploited to model the questions in order to adequately represent the 
hidden contextual information. Table 1 presents the modeling of four 
sample CQs of the knowledge considered in this research. 
Table 1 presents samples of the formalized CQs in second column of 
the table against the expressed CQs in natural language as appeared in 
 Fig. 1.Ontology Development Methodology.  E.F. Aminu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Intelligent Systems with Applications 16 (2022) 200125
4the first column. The FOL model enables the contextual information of 
every question to be expressed, in other words, allows entailment of 
hidden knowledge. The first row contains the sample CQ for fertilizer 
knowledge, which is about the suitable fertilizers for maize plant. The 
logic takes cognizance of the two classes of fertilizers that can be 
applied. However, each of the classes has the most suitable type for 
maize crop; that is, not all types of fertilizers can be applied. Conse -
quently, the use of existential quantifier (9x) has to be invoked for both 
classes of fertilizers. In this case, PoultryDropping for OrganicFertilizer 
class and NitrogenPhosphorusPotassium (NPK) and Urea for Inorga -
nicFertilizer class are independently suitable for maize cultivation 
because of their Nitrogen content. The hidden knowledge or contextual 
information of the (informal) CQ that is modelled by the logic (the 
formal CQ) is that maize crop is aHeavyFeederOfNitrogen . This concate -
nated word is a relation (object property) for classes MaizeCrop and 
Nitrogen as shown in the first row, second column of Table 1. The second 
row is the CQ for soil knowledge; third row is the CQ for irrigation 
knowledge and the last row contains sample CQ for pest/insects 
knowledge of maize crop. The output is at the right side of the impli -
cation symbol (→), which is the consequence of antecedent knowledge 
at the left side. iv. The next step formalizes the ontology using latest version of Prot˘eg˘e 5.5.0 edition that strongly supports the OWL2. Terms 
specified in steps 2 and 3 are formalized in OWL along with constraints 
enforcement while, the formulated CQs of step 3 are formulized using 
SWRL. 
Next step is evaluation, which is a process of carrying out consistency 
checks of ontology in adherence to proper concepts. The process in-
volves ontology validation and verification with respect to W3C se-
mantic web vocabularies convention. In this research, the eight popular 
metrics of structural based evaluation is employed. In addition, HermiT 
version 1.3.8.413, an ontology reasoner was constantly used to verify 
and validates consistencies of the ontology ’s concepts. CQs were enco-
ded in SQWRL to validate the correctness content of the ontology; and 
domain experts ascertained the level of results ’ accuracy. In case of any 
defect, the ontology developer can easily loops back to previous steps for 
correction. 
Ontology evolution is the last step of this design methodology. The 
principle of ontology ’s scalability is an important aspect of evolution 
that aids ontology ’s self-growth and reuse. In view of this, the following 
novel Algorithm 1 presents design framework on how the proposed 
ontology can autonomously evolve.

5From this algorithm, it is expected to define before engage in 
execution of all the necessary user define methods that aid its objective. 
This is collectively termed as Ontology evolution threads in this research 
as shown by line 1; they include SemanticRelation, OntStatement, 
getRelatedAxiom and load WordNet. 
From lines 2 to 5, user inputs query string as competency question; 
and the query is immediately preprocessed to eliminate stop words like

starts to manifest from line 9. 
From lines 10 to 12, the user defined methods activate and load 
WordNet to learn the terms. It also determines with the aid of Seman -
ticRelation and OntStatement methods if such term is a super class 
(hypernymy), subclass (hyponymy) or relation (meronymy). Class can 
either serves as domain class or range class; it depends on the relation. 
This research is only considering the nouns POS; which are equivalent of 
classes and individuals in OWL ontology. Consequently, from lines 13 to 
19, the terms are being validated by the methods if they are classes or 
individuals. Hence the ontology is autonomously updated via the map-
ping strategy between MaCOnto, the domain ontology and WorldNet, 
the lexical database. If no update takes place, it implies that the term is 
outside the domain consideration as represented by line 20 and the 
ontology returns. At line 23, the pseudocode checks by the do…while loop 
construct if the condition is satisfy. That is, the counter (i) checks if it has 
got to the last term (n) in the string data structure. 
4.The proposed MaCOnto ’s framework 
The proposed MaCOnto is defined based on the Maize Crop Knowl -
edge Framework (MCKF) primarily consist of MaizeCrop (Mo) itself, 
Soils (So), Fertilizers (Fo) and Irrigation (Io) knowledge. Other Sup-
portive Knowledge (SKo) are Climatic Conditions (Windspeed, Humid -
ity, Sunlight, and Temperature), Farm Implements, Pest/Insects and 
Diseases. Therefore, the ontology is formulized as follows: 
MaCOntoDCCPCICαF (1)  
where C stands for set of nonterminal Concepts or Classes for the 
domain. In this research work, C comprises set of classes for Soils, Fer-
tilizers, Irrigation and other considered knowledge of Maize Crop. That 
is, 
CCMo}CSo}CFo}CIo}CSKo (2) 
P is set of Properties. Typically, property may be defined as set of 
relationship (R) that exists between concepts. That is, 
R≤C×CBOntheother handC⊥r∃RBr⊔c1Cc2Bc1Cc2∃C⊓ (3) 
However, in this research work the definition of Eq. (3) only hold for 
object property, which implies relationship (R). This is because Data 
Property (Pd) of (nonterminal or terminal) concept is also an essential 
component to consider for robust ontology. OWL based ontology is 
robust when developer equally harvests all required concepts from 
collection sources strictly in accordance to classes, individuals and 
(object and data) properties. However, in many cases, data property 
component is not considered, which inadvertently affect the correctness 
of ontology in terms of annotation. 
PdcdCid (4)  
that is, (class data property (cd), individual data property (id)). For example, class MaizeCrop hasRoot ; therefore, hasRoot is Pd specifically, 
it is cd. Because the data property belong to a class. Conclusively, 
property component of OWL is expressed in this research as: 
PRUP d (5) 
Symbol I stands for Individual which is/are terminal(s) set of c. that 
is, 
cx⊔i0Ci1Ci2C…in⊓n≽0 (6) 
α represents rules and constraints of concept, which is expressed as 
follow 
α 
CinfCCcon)
(7) 
Where Cinf stands for Contextual information derived from compe -
tency questions that form the rules. Ccon denotes Concept ’s constraints 
such as transitive and functional characteristics of object property. 
Furthermore, the development of MaCOnto is analogously described 
by the conceptual framework of Fig. 3. As stated by Eq. (1), the devel -
opment of the application-based ontology consists of taxonomy and 
semantic components ’ implementation. 
The framework of Fig. 3 is described as three-tier architectural 
design. They are:  
i Knowledge Collection: this is the first tier of the architecture where 
the required knowledge in textual forms are collected from reliable 
and trusted information sources. The domain experts constantly 
validate the (soils, fertilizers and irrigations) knowledge based on the 
defined domain of maize crop. Middle-out-approach is employed in 
this work as concept identifying technique owing to its ability to first 
identify most important concepts and then generalized and special -
ized into other concepts.  
ii Ontology Design: the second tier illustrates how the domain 
ontology is designed. The domain ontology at this level primarily 
consist of Eqs. (2) to 6; that is, ⊑C, P, I,⊒without contextual infor-
mation derived from the set of CQs (α). The entities of 309 classes, 
443 object properties, 176 data properties and 502 individuals based 
on OWL representation model defined the domain ontology at this 
point. From Fig. 3, classes, prop and ind denote the Classes, Properties 
and Individuals respectively. The entities are encoded via Prot˘eg˘e 
editor. At this level of the design, the ontology cannot performed a 
robust competency tasks; hence, the need for the last tier.  
iii Inference Design: This research goes beyond development of 
lightweight ontology or typical domain ontology that cannot 
perform competency tasks. It is extended by enforcing high-level 
constraints on concepts for example, properties are designed to be

Intelligent Systems with Applications 16 (2022) 200125
6transitive, functional and symmetric. Besides, class component of the 
domain ontology from second tier are furthered encoded by 
considering Classes General Axiom (CGA) mechanism of Prot˘eg˘e to 
minimize the challenge of synonyms. More importantly, the vali-
dated CQs are modeled using FOL as shown by the samples of 
Table 1. Consequently, the logics are encoded into rules and axioms 
with the aid of SWRL of Prot˘eg˘e; so that the ontology can perform 
robust competency tasks. That is, to infer contextual knowledge 
based on the informal query in CQs form. In the end, an OWL Rule 
based application ontology that autonomously evolves is developed. 
The aspect of ontology evolution is achieved via the adoption of 
WordNet as ontology to ontology mapping strategy as earlier shown 
by algorithm 1. Table 2 shows the SWRL representation of the CQs 
already modeled in FOL of Table 1 and their corresponding query 
format: SQWRL. 
Table 2 presents samples of implemented CQs using SWRL as shown 
by the second column of the Table. The first CQ in first row of the Table, 
which is on fertilizers knowledge, formulized the modeled CQ in FOL 
into SWRL using the notations. Concepts such as Fertilizers, Inorga -
nicFertilizers and NPK_Fertilizer are defined using letter as atom or vari-
able, which is normally preceded by question mark (?) symbol in 
parenthesis. For example, the concept Fertilizers is coded in SWRL as 
Fertilizers(?f) ; and the concepts are separated with the exponential 
symbol (^). The knowledge that precede the implication symbol (-F) 
such as containsAlotOf(PoultryDropping, Nitrogen) is termed as ante-
cedent knowledge. While the knowledge after the symbol is termed as 
the consequent that represents the output of the knowledge. Thus, the 
OWL axioms and the SWRL in the Table 2 are transferred to the rule 
engine (Drools). Consequently, execution take place and the inferred 
axioms were successfully transferred back to the OWL model. 
Similarly, the corresponding representation of the rule but in query 
form is the SQWRL shown by the third column of Table 2. Ontology 
query language that complies with the OWL evolution in terms of in- 
depth supports for semantic expressivity of axioms and rules is 
required; hence, the motivation for SQWRL. This query language works 
by using the antecedent and consequent parts of the SWRL as pattern 
specification and retrieval specification respectively. However, in order 
to avoid duplication of results during query, some special functions such 
as sqwrl:makeSet(?s1, ?f) is used. In this example, the atom (?s1) makes a 
union set of the concept Fertilizer (?f) regardless of the numbers of time it 
appears in the ontology file. The second row of the Table 2 shows the 
corresponding SWRL and SQWRL of the FOL model for soils. While, the 
third column is for irrigation knowledge, the last row is for knowledge on pest and insects. Therefore, the results are discussed in the next 
section of this research. 
5.MaCOnto ’s results and discussion 
This section firstly, presents and discusses the results of the devel -
oped MaCOnto based on the terminological construct of OWL and the 
competency questions. Similarly, the result of how the ontology 
autonomously evolve is equally discussed. Secondly, the results of the 
ontology ’s different forms of evaluations are also discussed in this sec-
tion of the paper. 
The ontology is developed using the java based Prot˘eg˘e editor, and 
the summary result is graphically presented by Fig. 4. 
Fig. 4 shows the summary representation of the ontology graphically, 
using OntoGraf of Prot˘eg˘e by considering only the core classes. The 
rectangular boxes of the Figure represent the core classes and the plus 
() signs signify that they are all super classes. As clearly shown by the 
Figure, every other classes span out from the root (default) class owl: 
Thing . As such, each of the classes contain numbers of classes among 
which are also super classes to some other classes. For examples, Figs. 5 
and 6 demonstrate fragmented results of the implemented soils and 
supportive knowledge respectively for terminological aspect of the 
ontology, semantically. 
Fig. 5 presents the snapshot of the implemented results of some 
classes of the soils knowledge. The arrows that precede some classes of 
the Figure for instance, Soil_Organisms, SoilAmendment and Soils signify 
that the entities are super classes. SoilAmendment has

7InorganicAmendments and OrganicAmendments as subclasses. This is the 
same implementation and operational methods with the super classes of 
the knowledge. Similarly, Fig. 6 presents other supportive knowledge 
such as ClimaticCondition along with subclasses, FarmChemicalTreatment 
and Pest/Insects . Pests or Insects is a similar class to Disease. Figs. 7 and 8 
also partly present the implemented classes for fertilizer and irrigation 
knowledge respectively. 
From Fig. 7, class Fertilizer_Application_Methods has BandingApplica -
tionMethod, BroadcastingApplicationMethod and others directly appeared 
under it as subclasses. Similarly, different categories of fertilizers are 
encoded along with their examples. Fig. 8 also partly presents the irri-
gation concepts such as Surface_Irrigation, Sprinkler_Irrigation and 
Drip_Irrigation . 
As stated earlier, CGA is employed to provide similar metadata to the 
agronomic concepts; therefore, Fig. 9 presents an implemented example 
for soil concept. 
The class Soils has Edaphic_Requirement and Soil_Conditions as 
equivalent concepts. However, beyond this effort, the developers of the 
ontology provide a metadata mechanism to easily identify concepts. As 
shown by Fig. 9, this is an annotation mechanism such that when 
document in the ontology contain concepts like compositionOfOrga -
nicMatter or mixtureOfSandClaySilt , it can be ascribed to the class Soils. 
Summarily, all the 309 classes along with 443 object properties, 176 
data properties and 502 individuals are duly implemented. The OWL file 
of the ontology can be accessed via https://github.com/enesifa/Enesi/ 
blob/main/MaCOnto_OWL%20File.owl. 
More so, Figs. 10 and 11 present the results of querying the first and 
last CQs as earlier shown by Table 2 using the SQWRL of SWRL. 
The semantic result of the CQ: What is the best fertilizer type for maize 
is displayed as variables n, u and a at the bottom of Fig. 10. Each of these 
variables contains NitrogenPhosphorusPotassium_Fertilizer, Urea_Fertilizer 
and PoultryDropping respectively as value; they are highlighted in blue color of Fig. 10. The query as earlier written on the third column, row 
one of Table 2 is successfully executed using drools engine. Similarly, 
Fig. 11 equally presents the result of successful execution of another 
sample CQ. 
The CQ: What type of pesticide to use if earworm, stem borer or army-
worm is noticed is named S72 in the SWQRL tab as shown in Fig. 11. The 
SQWRL is executed by the drool engine of Prot˘eg˘e and produces tabular 
results shown by the highlighted blue color at the bottom of the 
Figure labelled columns i and p. Column i, which is a coded atom for 
Insecticides_Treatment displays the corresponding treatment for the three 
diseases. Column p highlights the diseases. For example, the pesticide for 
treatment of EarWorm disease is Cypermethrin . However, each of the 
outputs has prefix of maizeCropOntology_MODIFY3_VALIDATION: as 
namespace. 
Furthermore, Fig. 12 shows the implementation results of how the 
ontology autonomously evolves based on the given CQ. 
Considering the executed CQ from Fig. 12, the only single candidate 
term is tree, a noun concept which could be superclass or subclass. 
However, the term is not found in the manually curated ontology file, 
whereas in actual sense, it could be a superclass to the term Maize_Crop . 
That is, Maize_Crop is part of Tree. Therefore, through the imple -
mentation of Algorithm 1 and the conceptual framework of Fig. 3, the 
term is autonomously added to the system. Firstly, since the term is not 
part of the ontology file, the WordNet is automatically activated to 
process the relevance of the term to the ontology by checking its se-
mantic relations. Secondly, once the condition is satisfy, the system infer 
maize crop to be the only tree in this context. Therefore, the term tree is 
considered as hypernymy of the class Maize_Crop based on the concepts

Intelligent Systems with Applications 16 (2022) 200125
8mapping between the MaCOnto ’s file and the WordNet ’s semantic 
relation. 
Consequently, the semantic relations of either meronym or hol-
onymy hold for the two concepts; and the term Tree is autonomously 
updated as class of the ontology. Similarly, the duo knowledge models 
also infer a user defined relation: hasVariousGrowthParts from the 
ontology as a result of the existence of the term: part in the CQ. Thus, the 
semantic result, which is Maize_Crop has VariousGrowthParts Maize_ -
Growth_Parts is displayed as shown by the Figure. The result is a hy-
perlink text upon clicking; various parts of maize crop as tree are 
displayed. 
5.1. MaCOnto evaluations 
In addition to HermiT reasoner for checking the consistency of 
MaCOnto ontology, structural and competency based evaluations were 
duly carried out to ascertain its validity. The details of the validations 
are as follows. 
5.1.1. MaCOnto structural based evaluation 
The ontology structural based evaluation is driven by the eight 
popular metrics (Vrandecic, 2010; Yao et al., 2005) listed in Table 3. 
MaCOnto is evaluated against the average and median values of 1413 
existing OWL ontologies. The OWL based ontologies obtained via 
swoogle have become a standard of ontology ’s validation and verifica -
tion (Sicilia et al., 2012 ; Wang & Wang, 2018 ). 
Table 3 presents the results of MaCOnto ’s structural evaluations 
against the existing ontologies based on the eight metrics. The first 
metric is the classes ’ numbers (cn). While the standard average and 
median number of classes for OWL ontologies are 36 and 6 respectively; 
the proposed MaCOnto has an outstanding number of 309 classes. The 
second and third structural evaluation metrics are numbers of individual 
and object properties with expected average numbers of 28 and 24 
respectively. However, the proposed MaCOnto has 502 individuals ’ 
numbers (in) and 443 number of object properties (op). Similarly, the 
fourth metric is the root classes ’ numbers (rcn), which are numbers of 
classes that are mainly first level super classes. In this research, there are 
109 numbers of root classes against the average and median minimum 
numbers of 6 and 5 respectively. 
Therefore, the results of the first four metrics (that is, cn, in, op and 
rcn) for MaCOnto are far higher than their corresponding average and 
median values of the existing 1413 benchmark OWL ontologies. The 
results validate the robustness of the ontology developed in this 
research. 
Furthermore, the fifth metric is average population (ap), which is 
obtained by dividing the absolute value of individuals ’ numbers by the 
classes ’ number. That is, ap |in| / |cn| which is equal to |502| / |309| 
or 1.62. This is against the average value of 1.34 for this metric; this 
implies the proposed ontology has a promising average population. 
Similarly, the sixth metric, which is utilization of class (uc) is obtained 
by dividing the absolute value of the number of classes that have a 
minimum of one individual by the classes ’ numbers. That is, uc |c| / | 
cn| which is equal to |309 –25| / |309|. |c| is calculated by subtracting 
numbers of classes without individuals, which is 25 from the total 
number of classes. With 0.92 for uc, it indicates that the ontology ’s in-
dividuals adequately utilized the classes. 
More so, schema deepness (sd), which is the seventh metric clearly 
portrays the robustness level of ontology. It is computed by dividing the 
number of subclasses by the total number of classes; that is, sd |nsc| / | 
cn| which is 200/309. Subtracting the number of root classes from 
number of the classes, derives the number of subclasses; that is, |nsc| | 
cn| - |rcn|. The value of sd clearly determine the robustness of the 
ontology in terms of how the classes are spread to form the ontology 
inheritance pattern. A higher value obtained for sd compared to the 
benchmark values shows the deepness of the ontology. Else, if the value 
of sd is less than the benchmark values, such ontology is described to be 
Fig. 7.Fertilizer Knowledge Classes.  
Fig. 8.Irrigation Knowledge Classes.  E.F. Aminu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Intelligent Systems with Applications 16 (2022) 200125
9flat. But, in the case of this research owing to the value of sd, the 
ontology is described to be deep. 
Finally, the last metric is the diversity of relationship (dr), which is obtained by dividing the absolute value of object properties (op) by the 
summation of number of subclasses and object properties. That is, dr | 
op| / |nscop| (|443| / (|200 443|)); this translate to dr value of 443/

Intelligent Systems with Applications 16 (2022) 200125
10643 or 0.96. This last metric intends to signify the multiplicity of 
ontology ’s properties (relations). This is based on theory that ontology 
consist many relations other than meronyms and holonyms, which are 
class inheritance relations. However, the value of dr in this research is 
less than the average dr value but closely equal to the median value. 
Therefore, since the total numbers of properties in the proposed 
ontology are the user defined relations; it can be concluded that the 
value is on the fair side. 
In conclusion, the structure of MaCOnto is evidently robust and 
stable judging from the values obtained from the eight metrics. Thus, 
Fig. 13 represents the results of the metrics graphically for clarity of 
comparisons. 
The graphical representation of the results of structural evaluation of 
the ontology is clearly shown in percentage by Fig. 13. Obviously, except 
for the diversity of relationship metric, the proposed ontology is sufficiently robust. Nonetheless, the result of MaCOnto for relationship 
diversity is fairly satisfactory because it is very close to the median value 
of the existing ontologies. 
5.1.2. MaCOnto ’s competency based evaluation 
Competency Question (CQ) forms another distinctive metric for 
ontology ’s validation. This evaluation is carried out by using the formal 
CQs as input string. It is important to mention that the CQs are not 
directly dependent on the contents of the ontology ’s file. The total 
number of CQs validated for this research is eighty; Table 4 presents 
them in four categories considering the four knowledge sources. 
The formal CQs (SWRL) are executed in their query forms that is, the 
SQWRL; and the results are shown by Table 4. Out of the 24 validated 
CQs for soils maize concepts, two (2) failed to give complete accurate 
results. For example, the CQ: Which type of soil can irrigation be carried out 
in maize cultivation returns Soil_Separates as part of results. Similar de-
ficiencies were recorded in the other knowledge as rightly shown by the 
Table. The rationale behind the inaccurate results is largely traced to the 
multiplicity and similarity of user defined relations (object properties) 
between the given concepts. Consequently, this deficiency manifest on 
the obtained value of diversity of relationship metric of the structural 
based evaluation. Numbers of CQs with deficiencies results are 3, 2 and 
1 for maize fertilizers, maize irrigation and maize pests/climatic con-
dition respectively. The results displayed were studied and validated by 
the domain experts. At the end, the competency based evaluation ach-
ieved an overall result with accuracy of 90%. Therefore, Fig. 14 presents 
the summary result of the evaluation in graphical form. Nonetheless, 
CQs that could not return complete expected results are attributed to the 
diversity of relations as earlier observed in the previous structural based 
evaluation.

11The formal CQs for each knowledge as presented by Table 4 are 
queried and tested in SQWRL formats. In the overall, the accuracy of the 
returned results being validated by domain experts is clearly promising 
as shown by Fig. 14. From the Figure, the summary accuracy of the 
proposed ontology based on the CQs is 90%, while the remaining 10% 
accounts for inaccurate results. This is tolerated because the magnitude 
of the inaccurate results is not total; that is, the inaccurate results 
contain a larger numbers of accurate results but contain one or more 
inaccurate concepts. 
6.Conclusions and future work 
In this research, a robust ontology christened MaCOnto, is developed 
based on the domain of maize crop but primarily considered the soils, 
fertilizers and irrigation agronomic concepts. MaCOnto is an extension 
of two earlier published literature of OWL Rule based ontology models; 
firstly, for soils and fertilizers ’ maize crop agronomic concepts; and 
secondly for soils and irrigation knowledge for maize crop. The devel -
opment of the ontology is premised on manual top-down approach of the 
six steps iterative ontology engineering principle. The domain knowl -
edge is represented using OWL2 based on RDF/XML syntax; while the 
CQs, which are modeled using FOL, are encoded into ontology files using 
the SWRL. Consequently, the ontology is queried in the format of the 
formal CQs as query input strings using SQWRL as query language. 
Hundreds of CQs initially collected via questionnaire instrument were 
finally scaled down to 80 after several analysis and validation by the 
team of domain experts. In the overall, MaCOnto has 309 classes include 
the root class of owl:Thing , 619 number of properties and 502 numbers of 
individuals component. Therefore, considering the sizes of the ontol -
ogy’s classes, properties and individuals following the results of the 
structural based evaluation, the proposed MaCOnto is described to be a 
deep ontology. In addition, efforts were equally made to exploit Class 
General Axiom technique of Prot˘eg˘e tool to provide metadata for the 
ontology ’s entities. More importantly, the robustness of the ontology 
leverages on the eighty (80) validated CQs by domain experts; and the 
new mechanism to allow the ontology to autonomously evolve. 
Furthermore, in order to ascertain the validity and verification of the 
ontology, structural and competency based evaluations were carried 
out; and the results are promising. This is in addition to the consistency 
checks of the ontology using the HermiT reasoner of Prot˘eg˘e 5.5.0. 
Therefore, the results recall are precisely defined, which saves a lot of 
retrieval response time and computational cost. However, a Graphical 
User Interface (GUI) would be developed so that user can query the 
MaCOnto ’s files in informal CQ or natural language form. Besides, the 
results obtained for autonomous evolution of the ontology is practically 
limited; because the novel algorithm can only add a single new concept 
that is a class or individual from a given CQ. The algorithm could not 
consider or adds new concept as semantic relation; consequently, it is 
yet to add two classes from a given CQ. More so, the data source 
(WordNet) employed to autonomously update MaCOnto is limited, 
because it is a general lexical ontology or database. Therefore, there are contending issues of polysemy associated with the data source to care-
fully select an intended concept to update the ontology. In future, an 
alternative peculiar semantic database like AGROVOC would be 
considered for autonomous update of the ontology.
