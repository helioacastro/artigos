Abstract
This paper seeks to understand how caring for new-born livestock is made possible, which prac-tices of care are privileged and to what effect? These aims are situated in attempts to promote the
prudent use of antibiotics amongst livestock farmers to prevent antimicrobial resistance. In focus-
ing on the rearing of new-born calves on dairy and beef farms in England and Wales, the paperreveals how care is con ﬁgured by different temporal orders, the tensions between different tem-
poralities of care, the reasons for them and the strategies employed by calf rearers to manage
these tensions. Drawing on the concept of the ‘timescape ’, the paper shows how calf care tem-
poralities are relationally enacted and con ﬁgured by materials, infrastructures and technologies.
Common (productivist) agricultural temporalities of care emphasise speed, urgency and ef ﬁciency.
However, by analysing the practice of feeding colostrum and ‘tubing ’–the forced feeding of calves
via a tube inserted into the oesophagus –we highlight how these rapid caring temporalities con ﬂict
with the slower, patient skills of calf rearing. At the same time, however, we show how care is
rendered ﬂuid as calf rearers ﬁnd ways of accommodating seemingly discordant temporalities –
what we call ‘patient urgence ’–allowing different temporalities to co-exist within agricultural
timescapes. Nevertheless, we show how these practices of accommodation are themselves the
result of a productivist temporal order that marginalises calves and calf rearers. We argue thatthese timescapes point to the need for broader structural and cultural changes within agriculture
to reduce the use of antibiotics.

Introduction
Feeding new-born calves like this is a routine practice of care found across dairy and beef farms.
During this neonatal stage of life, careful practices are vital to aiding long-term health and a pro-ductive life. But routine care is not straightforward on farms, nor is it a neutral practice. Care, as
Reisman (2021: 403) suggests, is situated within a ‘politics of relational maintenance ’that‘sustains
particular forms of agrarian political economy that bene ﬁt some at the expense of others ’. Careful
practices are established within ‘biosocial collectivities ’(Holloway et al., 2023) in which material-
ities, people and the lively more-than-human relationally choreograph the possibilities for care, and
the possibilities for a range of ‘somatic sensibilities ’(Greenhough and Roe, 2011). The aim of this
paper is to understand the underlying politics of care in productivist agriculture: how calf care is
made possible, which practices of calf care are privileged and to what effect?
The need to answer these questions is situated within ongoing attempts to promote the respon-
sible use of antimicrobial medicines in agriculture as a result of concerns about a future in which
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) renders these treatments ineffective and dangerous to public health
‘Hi baby! ’, Amber cheerfully announces as she walks into the calf shed. There are reasons to be positive: two
new calves have been born. ‘Baby ’will do for now: individual names might come later. Amber hopes her job of
getting both calves to feed from the bottle will be straightforward. This is an urgent time: drinking colostrum –
the cow ’sﬁrst milk thick with immunoglobin –now will help build a calves ’immune system and help ﬁght
possible infections. She can tell the ﬁrst one is healthy: it is alert but quiet. Climbing into the pen, Amber squirts
some milk onto her ﬁngers and inserts it into the calf ’s mouth, slowly guiding the calf towards the bottle held in
her other hand, before quickly swapping her ﬁngers with the bottle ’s teat. The calf starts sucking noisily and
soon she can take her hand away completely. But the other calf in the pen is less vigorous and less inquisitivewhen Amber approaches. It doesn ’t know what to do, or how to suck: the teat rubs against her mouth, but
doesn ’t stay in. Patience is required, otherwise problems will unfold down the line. But Amber is also running
out of time: there are other urgent jobs to be done. After one last try, she turns to a small whiteboard attachedto the pen and notes that this calf needs further care and attention.Enticott and O ’Mahony 995
(O’Neill, 2016). Approximately half of the global use of antimicrobials is accounted for by live-
stock farming (Van Boeckel et al., 2015), their use having rapidly diffused into productivist agri-
culture (Kirchhelle, 2018) and sustained through practices that precipitate greater use in an
unvirtuous circle (Allen and Lavau, 2014). Warnings surrounding AMR invoke dark consequencesfor agriculture and an atmosphere of future uncertainty. As the repercussions of antimicrobial
overusage rebound within the ﬁelds and sheds of productivist farms, farmers must ﬁnd ways of
countering this threat, as much as responding to evidence of antibiotic resistance itself (Helliwellet al., 2019). Calls for the prudent use of antimicrobials and antimicrobial stewardship have there-
fore been accompanied by attempts to regulate or educate farmers about the dangers of AMR
(Hinchliffe et al., 2018).
As AMR warnings have intensi ﬁed, so the everyday has become as important as the excep-
tional. Daily farming routines and foundational husbandry principles have become reframed by
the AMR agenda as key activities to preventing resistance. In the case of calf rearing, feedingpractices have been given renewed importance which, if done properly, promote a healthy
metabolism and help prevent common ailments such as diarrhoea (often known as scour) and
pneumonia, and thereby reduce the need for antimicrobials (Bartram et al., 2017; RUMA,2018). However, calves have historically been marginalised on farms. As one vet told us,
calves are just not ‘sexy’enough to be a priority: they are not of immediate economic value,
nor do they necessarily capture the attention of t ech-orientated agri-businesses. This ontology
enacts what calves are thought to be, how they should be cared for, and who they are cared
by (cf. Mee, 2013; Vaarst and Sørensen, 2009), one mirrored within the AMR agenda. In the
United Kingdom, for example, numerical forms of medicinal governance, such as the use oftargets, are focused on productive adult cattle (RUMA, 2020). Calves, in contrast, appear to
escape these forms of medicinal surveillance, not least because their relative marginality
m e a n sd a t ai sh a r dt oc o m eb ya n dp a t t e r n so fa n t i b i o t i cu s ed i f ﬁcult to discern. Meanwhile, aca-
demic study focusing on adult cattle, pathologising the bodily sites of production, and focusing
on farm owners rather than all farm workers (such as calf rearers) further enacts this marginal-
isation. In this context, calf AMR has hitherto been framed around more nebulous concepts ofwelfare, and practices such as cleanliness, feedin g and ventilation (Helliw ell et al., 2020). In this
calf ontology, what can be done about the use of antibiotics in calf care, or what counts as
careful rearing, is not straightforward, pres enting dilemmas of care that calf rearers must
somehow resolve.
We explore these dilemmas and tensions of care through the lens of time. Compared to spa-
tialities, the temporalities of animal health and b iosecurity, or agriculture in general (Mincyte ̇
et al., 2020), have received less attention (for exceptions, see: Allen and Lavau, 2014;
Hinchliffe et al., 2016; Phillips, 2020b). As H enry et al. (2022) argue, despite farming ’s inherent
exposure to different temporalities –the role of the seasons, and the life cycle of birth, growth and
decay –spatialities overshadow temporal analyses, reducing them to ‘matters of fact ’, naturalis-
ing speed and eliding multiple temporaliti es. Instead, to explore the range and signi ﬁcance of
temporalities in calf care, we draw on Adam ’s (1998) concept of the ‘timescape ’,i nw h i c ht e m -
poralities are choreographed in relation to con ﬁgurations of materials, biologies and technologies
that are spatially distributed (cf. Law and Lien , 2014). In this context, we follow literature con-
ceptualising ‘care’to explore how calf care temporalities are relationally enacted and con ﬁgured
by materials, infrastructures and technologies (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015). These agricultural
timescapes commonly specify temporalities o f care that emphasise speed, urgency and ef ﬁciency
(Allen and Lavau, 2014). By focusing on the practices of feeding colostrum and ‘tubing ’–the
forced feeding of calves via a tube inserted into the oesophagus –we highlight how rapid and
urgent temporalities of care con
ﬂict with slower, patient skills of calf rearers. At the same
time, however, we show how time is rendered ﬂuid as careful practices ﬁnd ways of996 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
accommodating seemingly opposite temporalities –what we call ‘patient urgence ’–enabling dif-
ferent temporalities to co-exist within agricul tural timescapes, and allowing calf rearers to live
between these worlds. Nevertheless, we also consider how these practices of accommodation
are emergent from a productivist temporal orde r that marginalises calves and calf rearers. We
argue that these timescapes point to the need for broader structural and cultural changes within
agriculture to reduce the use of antibiotics. Drawing attention to these human and nonhuman mar-
ginalities is an important part of highlighting unjust intersections within agriculture, AMR
agendas and their politics of care.
The paper is structured as follows: ﬁrstly, we describe the relationship between care and time,
introducing the concept of the timescape and its relevance to animal health and biosecurity.Secondly, we describe the temporalities of calf car e, the tensions between different temporalities
of care, the reasons for them and the strategies employed by calf rearers to manage these
tensions. Finally, we conclude by highlighting t he way different caring temporalities can accom-
modate each other, whilst also highlighting the need for AMR initiatives to pay attention to
the systemic and structural dimensions of time scapes, rather than rely on individual behaviour
change.
The timescapes of animal health
Despite the interweaving of time and space in everyday life (May and Thrift, 2003), recent geog-raphies of biosecurity and animal health have largely focused on spatial imaginaries –such as the
border and borderlands (Hinchliffe et al., 2013) –rather than its temporalities. Just like space,
time is made through ‘socio-technical arrangements and everyday practices ’(Puig de la
Bellacasa, 2015) which form what Adam (1998) refers to as a ‘timescape ’. Timescapes
provide a temporal order to a landscape, establishi ng temporal expectations, routines, and appro-
priate conduct. Understood thus, the timescape of productivist agriculture seeks to create asmooth, rapid ﬂowing network of relations that maximise productivity, transporting animals
between different sites of production and conve rting them into food in the quickest and most ef ﬁ-
cient ways possible. The excesses of this temporal ity, however, come at the cost of environmental
protections (Franklin et al., 2021) and animal welfare (Haggerty et al., 2009). A biosecurity time-
scape is allied to this logic of productivism, ima gining a future temporality in which veterinary
technoscience promises disease freedom, so long as farmers follow appropriate medicinal prac-
tices in the present time. Biosecurity timescapes are therefore characterised by an urgent tempor-
ality to facilitate the rapid growth of crops and liv estock by pre-empting and overcoming frictions
–like disease outbreaks - that slow down livesto ck production and food processing, and disturb
their synchronisation. On the farm, this timescape summons an ‘affective atmosphere ’
(Anderson, 2010) that commonly prescribes prophylactic and pre-emptive medical interventions,
and orients farmers ’anticipatory senses to signs of ill health and the unexpected (Phillips, 2020a;
Wang, 2022). Elsewhere in the food system, pract ices are developed to overcome systemic tem-
poral frictions, but which may ironically increase the consequences of productive excess. For
example, Allen and Lavau (2014) describe how the rapid temporalities of ‘just-in-time ’food
systems heighten the risk of animal disease. In this tightly coupled timescape, chickens trans-
ported to slaughter must arrive at dedicated timesl ots. If delivery lorries stand idle by arriving
early, they risk a build-up of bacteria due to a lack of air ﬂow. Instead, early arriving lorries con-
tinue to drive to ensure suf ﬁcient ventilation.
However, suggesting that these temporalities are merely marked by speed and urgency belies the
complexity and precarity of temporal relations. Whilst dominant temporal paradigms may emerge,timescapes are ‘restless temporal regimes ’(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015) whose ﬂows, rhythms,
cycles, and tempos are not ﬁxed (Law and Lien, 2014), nor entirely predictable (Broz et al., 2021;Enticott and O ’Mahony 997
O’Mahony, 2022). These instabilities are re ﬂected in the rebounding temporality of AMR, frequently
enacted by an imagined future of biological breakdown and crisis as a result of the present-day
excesses and malpractices of productivist agriculture. This rebounding timescape is common
across narratives of productivist agriculture (Adam, 1998) but leads to ‘the everyday experience of
time [as] one of permanent precariousness: an on-going sense of urgency and crisis [which] calls
to act ‘now’’(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015: 694). Dominant technoscienti ﬁc timescapes are called
into question by such breakdowns: action in the present time by farmers and vets is demanded toprevent a future in which animal and human health is compromised. However, whilst the urgency
to do something about AMR highlights the creation and contest over how a timescape should be orga-
nised (cf. Helliwell et al., 2022), it also hints at the tensions and accommodations between a diversityof temporalities within the productivist biosecurity timescape. Thus, if productivist biosecurity time-
scapes direct attention to the sites and practices at which time is sped up (Henry et al., 2022), they can
also lead to a focus on marginal sites and practices in which these temporalities are contested throughslower practices of care (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010). Here, the emphasis has been on exploring a
feminist ethics of care in which more-than-human temporalities are identi ﬁed, nurtured, and accom-
modated (Mol, 2008). These actions highlight the existence of alternative more-than-human tem-poralities that operate at a different pace to those programmed by productivist timescapes.
Avoiding the kinds of ecological and biological breakdowns in productivist timescapes requires dif-
ferent forms of conduct: more-than-human temporalities are enacted through practices of attentive-ness (Krzywoszynska, 2019) and play (Ellis, 2022) by learning to be affected by more-than-human
temporality (Brice, 2014).
These embodied practices and ‘somatic sensibilities ’(Greenhough and Roe, 2011) are not neces-
sarily alien to sites of productivism: they are routinely found in the laboratory (Anderson and
Hobson-West, 2023; Giraud and Hollin, 2016) as well as the modern farm (Holloway et al.,
2023), or in times of crisis (Gibbs, 2020; Law, 2010). However, paying attention to caring tempor-alities problematises the notion of care, revealing its tension and co-existence in the timescapes of
technoscience and modern agriculture (Cusworth, 2023). For Haraway (2016) the solution to these
tensions lies in ‘staying with the trouble ’: adopting an ethics of care that seeks to make animals less
‘killable ’(Greenhough and Roe, 2011), developed through practices of attention and care-giving
that demonstrate ‘response-ability ’to others ’needs (Haraway, 2008). In doing so, the temporalities
of care become ﬂuid: transitioning between fast and slow to become neither one nor the other. Thus,
as Puig de la Bellacasa (2015: 692) concludes in relation to the temporalities of soil care, ‘care time,
in practice and experience, is neither a slowed mode of, nor outside, the timescales of technoscien-
tiﬁc futurity. Focusing on making care time does, however, offer glimpses into a diversity of time-
lines that, despite being made invisible or marginalised in the dominant timescape, can challenge
traditional notions of technoscienti ﬁc innovation ’.
This kind of temporal ﬂuidity, situated through the tensions of care is evident, at least impli-
citly, in recent relational and ecological concep tualisations of the management of animal health
(Broom and Doron, 2022). Firstly, Holloway et al. (2 023) identify biosocial collectivities as
‘intentional groupings that come together because members have a shared concern for a funda-
mentally biological issue ’(Morris and Holloway, 2014: 152). In analysing endemic livestock
disease, they show how they are connected to farm-speci ﬁc environments and priorities that
have become embedded by productivist modes of agriculture. In seeking to maintain welfare,practices of care, such as breeding resilience, ensure that the systemic causes of ill-health go
‘largely unquestioned ’(Holloway et al., 2023). As Holloway et al. (2023: 1293) suggest, this
makes ‘relations of care troubling because they can be associated with an acceptance of harm
b e i n gc a u s e dt oa n i m a l s ’. Moreover, in managing animal disease, practices of care involve
making animals ‘killable ’
to reduce individual or collective suffering, such as the continued trans-
mission of disease within the herd. Secondly, ot her relational approaches to animal disease998 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
understand the farm as a set of heterogeneous relations that prescribes a spatio-temporal order for
livestock from birth to productive life and death ( Law, 2006). Maintaining the rapid temporalities
of these productivist systems casts farmers as ‘ﬂuid engineers ’(Higgins et al., 2018) who seek to
prevent relations from ‘overﬂowing ’or breaking down in ways that recon ﬁgure temporal orders.
One way of preventing over ﬂows such as disease outbreaks is by using standardised practices
such as protocols and hygienic routines. Howev er, the complexity of these relations is such
that systems are never likely to be perfect and over ﬂows are inevitable (Enticott and Little,
2023). Practices of accommodation –care and ‘tinkering ’(Law, 2010) –allow these systems
to continue to function (Singleton and Law, 2013) as a form of ‘local universality ’(Enticott,
2012): making standardised systems workable in challenging environments using lived experi-ence (Krzywoszynska, 2016) to guide on-going experimental practices in order to ﬁnd ways of
living with uncertainty (cf. Atchison, 2015). Thi s is reliant on different practices of care in
which vets and farmers care for themselves, car e for their colleagues through informal learning
practices, and for the herd and farmers by deploying situated judgement rather than standardised
procedure. These practices of accommodation, choreographed through space and time (Law,
2010), show how care extends beyond its traditional understanding, and is implicated in promot-ing‘ongoingness ’(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017) –the work of sustaining and maintaining inter-
dependencies in all their forms. In this way, as Reisman (2021: 421 emphasis in original)
argues in relation to disease management, care ‘is not a solution but a perpetually open and
deeply political question of how relational maintenance takes place …it is a call to see the
web of relations …as the site of politics where the ongoingness of speci ﬁcc o n ﬁgurations of
existence is negotiated ’.
Efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics should therefore direct us to a consideration of the
complex timescapes of livestock agriculture. Payin g attention to these intersecting temporalities
is essential to understand how practices of care enable the maintenance of animal health, but alsothe material politics of care and its inclusions an d exclusions more widely. In this sense, care, like
time, is not normative: it is differentiated, troubl ing and evolves in relation to the situation at
hand. Yet, it is at these sites of contest that it is possible to witness the ﬂuid temporalities of
care, and ﬁnd ways for different times to live with each other. In what follows, we explore
how the future threat of AMR is folded into everyday practices of calf rearing. Rather than spe-
ciﬁc instances of AMR, we examine how its different temporalities are revealed through the
on-going, quotidian practices of care which res pond to its more nebulous threat by minimising
antimicrobial intervention. In doing so we disc uss the tensions between caring practices, who
cares and how it is valued; and the ﬂ
uidity that allows different temporalities to co-exist and
form a paradoxical temporality, one we call ‘patient urgence ’. Our analysis is based on qualitative
methods that were themselves temporal in natur e. Disrupted by the 2019 coronavirus disease pan-
demic, we conducted online interviews with 25 calf rearers in England and Wales, and a further
13 interviews with industry specialists (vets, a dvisers, nutritionists and equipment suppliers).
Reﬂecting the structure of the industry, all but one of the calf rearers interviewed was female.
Interviews employed a biographical narrative met hod to elicit descriptions through time of sig-
niﬁcant challenges and changes to calf care in the careers of calf rearers, and their evolution in
relation to the threat of AMR. In developing res earch relations with these calf rearers, and the
ebbs and ﬂows of lockdowns, we were able to conduct participant observation on three farms
where we observed the feeding of calves, and oth er routine calf rearing practices. This was sup-
plemented with video ethnography in which calf rearers were asked to wear Go-Pro cameras to
ﬁlm practices they felt were important to maintaining calf health and preventing AMR. This tech-
nique facilitated particular insights into the te mporal practices of care in absentia of researchers.
Further information on the characteristics of re search participants can be found in the supplemen-
tary material and in Enticott et al. (2022).Enticott and O ’Mahony 999
Feeding rapid temporalities
When new life emerges on farms, so it becomes enrolled into everyday practices that are partially
guided by the future threat of AMR. Feeding ﬂuids to calves –as Amber does here –is one such
example, revealing the ﬂuid temporalities of calf care and the politics of AMR. Speci ﬁcally, here we
refer to the practices of feeding milk to new-born calves, and pathologising of the conduct of
feeding at different bodily sites and through different kinds of milk. The neonatal phase of acalf’s life sees them born into the rapid timescape of bovine productivism. Calves must be carefully
(but also quickly) enrolled into this timescape because their future is de ﬁned by their response to
attempts to accelerate the development of their rumen. Rumen development is initially achievedby using concentrated feed (a coarse pellet known as calf starter) which stimulate microbes to
allow grass and forage to be fermented within the rumen (for more details see: AHDB,
Undated). The process be ﬁts the logic of productivist agriculture, replacing a calf ’s mother ’s
milk as a feed source. However, as Glen a calf vet told us, the acceleration of rumen development
is not easy and needs careful management:
[calves] are designed to be weaned at six months of age when they ’re ruminants. We ’re trying to turn a
baby pre-ruminant …a simple-stomached animal into a ruminant in a space of eight weeks. That takes a
There are two calves in the pen. To me, they look the same, with their brown and white coats, and over-sized ear tags.
But Amber, their calf rearer, tunes in to subtle differences: the one on the right seems livelier than the other. She assesseswhether the calf ’s coat is shinier, her ears more alert? The differences are made noticeable when Amber starts to feed
them. Slowly, she pours a bucket of freshly mixed milk into a ‘milk bar ’–a large plastic trough with three rubber teats.
Rather than move on to the next calves, she waits and watches. The calf on the right is straight in, sucking strongly, noisilyon the teat. The other struggles: it doesn ’t know what to do, the teat rubbing against its mouth, but not into it. It tries to
get the other calf ’s teat, then the spare one but with no success. Amber knows that if the calf doesn ’t learn to suck soon,
problems will follow that could require antibiotics. She leans into the pen, offering her hand to the calf, trying to guide itinto the teat. The calf is interested at ﬁrst, but then wanders off, unfed, leaving Amber to ponder what to do next.1000 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
lot of skill, and you need to get a lot of nutritional aspects right there. You need to feed a lot of milk, but
you also need to be improving …increasing their starch intake from day one in order to develop the
rumen so that when you wean them at eight weeks, they don ’t suffer a setback, and that that
weaning period coincides with a high risk for pneumonia.
Productivist temporalities therefore mean that the ﬁrst feeds are vital to help develop a calf ’s
immune system, as well as avert a future of AMR . The healthier the calf, the more productive
and resilient it will be in later life. Pneumoni a and scour, the conditio ns that calves are sus-
ceptible to, can have long-lasting conseque nces (Bartram et al., 2017) and require urgent
intervention to prevent transmission within th e herd. These are also conditions that antibio-
tics could be used to treat, particularly pneum onia which is understood to require rapid
medical interventions due to the rapid speed and i ntensity of infection: neonatal time is there-
fore an urgent moment in seeking the prudent us e of antibiotics and prevent the rebounding
of AMR. As part of these efforts, farm advisory o rganisations promote the use of colostrum.
Colostrum has been labelled ‘liquid gold ’(RUMA, 2018) because of the antibodies (immu-
noglobin) it contains. As one farm advisor told us: “colostrum [is] the root of [preventing] all
disease really. If the calf has not had decent colostrum, then it ’s going to need a lot of anti-
biotics to get it to adulthood ”(Laura). Urgency also arises t hrough the decreasing ability of
calves to absorb immunoglobin over time: calf r earers are advised to feed three litres in the
ﬁrst two hours of life, followe d by a similar feed within twelve hours (AHDB, 2020). Farm
assurance schemes in the Unite d Kingdom specify that calves must be fed colostrum within
six hours.
The urgency of feeding colostrum, coupled with the acceleration of weaning outlined above by
Glen the calf vet, re ﬂects an urgent productivist timescape. However, this timescape can be dis-
rupted by undesirable more-than-human tempor alities that might be bred into productivist
systems. Speci ﬁcally, dairy productivist systems value the genetic ability to do some things
quickly –become pregnant, give birth and grow –and maximise milk production, often at the
expense of health and welfare (see: Holloway et al., 2023). In block calving systems –when
breeding is organised so calving ordinarily occurs en masse in spring and/or autumn –this
rapid temporality is referred to as being ‘in sync ’:i fac o w ’s’reproductive system fails to
match the desired productivist ﬂow, they are likely to be culled to maintain the herd ’s synchron-
icity. The consequence of these temporal orders is a transformation of bovine sensibilities inwhich qualities of rapid growth and adaption are bred into cows, whilst slower practices of
mothering and natural feeding are bred out:
I think traditionally you would have left the calf o n the cow to suckle, or maybe left the calf with a
cow for a few days. But I think you ’re really putting a lot of faith in the mothering ability of the cow,
particularly with the genetics in the Holstein ’s now. A lot of that mothering has been bred out of
them. So, I wouldn ’t feel comfortable now just leaving calves just to work out how to suckle
(Katherine).
there ’s something wrong with the Holstein breed in my view, they seem to have lost the will [to suck].
You know, they ’re not very …They ’re not very vigorous (Pauline).
The excesses of these rapid productivist bovine sensibilities, ones contributing to rather than resolv-
ing health problems, are also witnessed at calving. Calf rearers talk of an appropriate speed at which
calves should be born in which they are ‘more likely to be born happy and healthy and take a good
stomach full of colostrum ’(Laura). By contrast, calvings that are ‘too slow ’(resulting from calves
being born backward or with twins) or ‘too quick ’are associated with abnormalities such as ﬂuid onEnticott and O ’Mahony 1001
their lungs, or mineral de ﬁciencies that require urgent medical intervention. Other aspects of pro-
ductivism may also affect how calves are fed colostrum. Endemic diseases like paratuberculosis
(known as Johne ’s disease) can be transmitted to calves by consuming infected colostrum.
Separating calves from cows at birth may thus ensure the long-term care of the herd, and potentiallyreduce the antibiotic treatment of sick cows, but means that the cow ’s teat is off limits for calves,
necessitating other feeding practices. Thus, if feeding colostrum enacts a productivist timescape,
one that closely couples logics of care with concerns about AMR rebound, these bovine sensibilitiespresent more-than-human frictions to the calf-rearing timescape.
While rearers understand the importance of feeding colostrum, they also face decisions over
which colostrum to feed. The best is often thought to be straight from the mother, partly becauseit is readily available, perceived as natural, and provides longer term immunity that is matched
to the local environment. In doing so it reduces the future need for antibiotics. However, getting
this colostrum into the calf is problematic because cows ’teats are pathologised as hazardous
bodily sites. Their cleanliness is called into question by their living conditions, but also the use
of antibiotic tubes of dry cow therapy, inserted into the teat to prevent infection in the weeks
before giving birth. The danger is that if a calf does suckle, its ﬁrst mouthful will be contaminated
with dirt, bacteria, and antibiotic residue. As Katherine told us, the best way for a calf to get its ‘ﬁll’
of colostrum is to feed the calf yourself.
Doing so, however, also requires caring for colostrum. Importantly, uncareful colostrum prac-
tices –often compromised by the urgencies and time constraints of competing on-farm temporal-
ities –can compound or contribute to ill health. Unclean bottles, dirty buckets, or inadequately
heated colostrum become vectors mobilising risky pathogens to susceptible calves. Some cowsmay fail to produce colostrum of suf ﬁcient quality –something common with ﬁrst time mothers
–whilst others can produce enough for more than one calf. Commonly, careful rearing practices
mean the excess colostrum of healthy cows is frozen, stored, and defrosted for subsequentbirths. As such, the care of future immunity p roduced by healthy cows is diffused throughout
the herd, and choreographed through practices enacted with multiple temporalities in mind.
Alternatively, some rearers purchase col ostrum powder which can be mixed with water
which should, time permitting, be mixed warm. Either way, colostrum quality is important,
something commonly measured and calculated by using a Brix refractometer. Re ﬂecting
Holloway et al. (2023), these temporalities of cal f care can be seen to enact a biosocial collect-
ive whose geography stretches around and beyond the farm gate, incorporating humans,
animals and materials.
Feeding protocols and patient urgence
As a way of reigning in the productivist excesses o f these bovine temporalities, calf rearers often
deploy two colostrum-related feeding practices. B oth practices sustain p roductivist timescapes
but in ways that reduce the likelihood of AMR rebound. The ﬁrst of these is the use of
feeding protocols, such as the monitoring of colostrum quality before feeds, or at least at
regular periods throughout the year. This allows cal f rearers to eliminate poor quality colostrum
being the cause of ill-health in growing calves. Most protocols relate to the amount of colostrum
to be fed to calves, the temperature to which it should be heated, and when it should be fed. Other
protocols encompass routine hygiene procedur es including cleaning feeding equipment such as
buckets, or sterilising rubber teats. Similarly, m any calf-rearers establish protocols, often with
their vets, to guide and monitor the use of medicines, whether anti-in ﬂammatories and painkillers,
or antibiotics.
The use of protocols provides a further way of standardising the timescape, choreographing
behaviour and eliminating the causes of ill-health to maximise ef ﬁcient productivist ﬂows, whilst1002 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
avoiding its excesses that contribute to AMR. Implementing and following protocols therefore
enacts speci ﬁc practices of care that are consistent with desirable timescapes of calf rearing, and
their outcomes. Here, care is not just for calves, but applies to the labour force and the reputation
of the farm as a producer of strong healthy calves. For example, Michelle describes how she hadwon awards for her calf rearing, which had led to her selling calves to another farmer because
they valued their health status. Central to this reputation within the industry was a set of protocols
that were used to monitor how effectively staff cared for calves, as much as the health of calvesthemselves:
if someone doesn ’t follow the protocol, with new-born calves, for example, or with the animals and
feeding, and then and then there ’s some kind of problem down the line, I might be able to know if some-
one’s sort of making the record up or hasn ’t done it properly …we have such high standards, for
example, with cleanliness and cleaning, and our other protocols, and he [calf rearer] couldn ’t really
go any further. He found it hard to ful ﬁl all the expectations of the job and, it sounds really ruthless,
but we had to let him go.
In this sense, Michelle ’s use of protocols demonstrates how care can be multi-faceted and collect-
ive, not limited to just an animal or plant, but to other people and the farm as a business.
Establishing and implementing protocols in response to the threat of AMR therefore enacts a pro-
fessional identity for calf rearers, and the skills they should possess such as attention to detail andthoroughness. Thus, calf rearers who do not follow such protocols or who fail to pay full attention to
how they feed calves can be cast as unloving and uncaring. For example, referring to a former col-
league, Amber said:
I don ’t think she cared about the calves as much as what we did, she kind of came in and did it as a job
whereas I do it for the love of calves …I know we had a couple of Heifers shot down at the other unit
[I used to work at] because they weren ’t growing properly because they hadn ’t had the right start. So, we
want to get at least four litres of colostrum into them in the ﬁrst feed so she ’d say she ’d put four litres in
and they ’d still be [some left] in the bottom and she ’d go oh, yeah, it ’s had 4 litres, take the rest away …
Whereas to me that is crucial to get that four litres in so every last bit has to go in. (Amber)
Say if it was if it was born just after milking in the morning, it wouldn ’t get fed till milking time in the
afternoon, till four or ﬁve o’clock or six o ’clock, it could be about that time until my uncle could get to it.
Well, I ’m like it has always got to have colostrum. You know, I ’d go in if I needed to, if it was born in
the middle of day I ’d have to get in the parlour to go and get some milk off it. (Abbie)
Nevertheless, just as others have shown elsewhere in animal disease management (Enticott, 2012),
care or tinkering (Law and Mol, 2011) is also integral to the application of protocols. This meansfeeding colostrum ought to be a carefully unfolding practice, rather than one that blindly follows a
pre-set protocol. Whilst calf rearing protocols offer the promise of standardisation consistent with
productivist timescapes, in practice, different forms of care are inherent to them. Indeed, as Andreaa calf vet pointed out, the point of protocols is not just to specify speci ﬁc practices, but also explain
how those practices should be performed:
If everything ’s organised, and they ’ve got protocols in place, it ’s not to complicate things, it ’s actually to
make things simpler so that there is no panic about, ’Oh, gosh, what do I do? Oh, how much colostrum
do I give it? Oh, gosh, what am I supposed to do? Where ’s the milk? ’You know? Everything ’s done in a
sort of less hasslely manner …the aim is to do things in the best way possible. And the best welfare-
friendly ways. And that ’s got to be calmly and gently (Andrea).Enticott and O ’Mahony 1003
Careful feeding practices that go beyond the protocol draw on other skills of calf rearing, notably
patience and taking time. The veterinary profe ssion has been instrumental in ingraining the
importance of feeding protocols amongst calf rearers, but there was also concern about the
effects of ‘becoming hooked ’(Pauline) on protocols and not knowing what to do when, for
example, equipment breaks. For some calf-rear ers, however, feeding protocols were not set in
stone and represented an object of experimentat ion, as shown in the following examples high-
lighting how calf-rearers adapt colostrum feeding practices over time, and challenge ‘old’
ways of rearing calves:
It’s making wee tweaks to your protocols along the way. So, yeah, I mean it was four times a day and it ’s
now just at either end as long as they take something in. You know, even if it is just a litre, it ’s enough to
keep them hydrated to the next feed, and then hopefully they ’ve made an improvement, that they want to
drink themselves, and I think that ’s always quite a good sign (Fiona).
We started changing the protocol around looking after the calves and the routines of calf-rearing. For
example, previously we didn ’t use to give new-born calves any water. I think it ’s because old
farmers worry if they give calves water, the calves wouldn ’t drink the colostrum and milk so they
don’t want to give them water. But water is so important. And even if they drink water, they will
still drink milk. Now all the calves are given water and corn in the ﬁrst twelve to twenty-four hours
to help them through. So, this is one of the protocols we brought in (Michelle).
These adaptions appear to be antithetical to the urgency of feeding. Instead, patience slows the farm
timescape down to the times of calves. Patience enables rearers to become calf as far as possible: to
develop a sensuous understanding of a calf ’s life and recognise through multi-sensory attunements
when individual calves are ‘not right ’. Spending time in the calf shed watching calves play, listen-
ing to their breathing, understanding their posture, and noticing ‘good and bad poo ’, are connected
to the patient sensibilities of skilled rearing. As Lucy described:
As soon as you go in a pen of calves, they think they ’re going to be feed, so it ’s a race to the front. You
will always get one, if it ’s poorly sat at the back and a bit slow to come, that ’s one sign. And maybe an
ear that ’s slightly drooped that ’s another, maybe mycoplasma …Just breathing, tifting we call it: just
breathing slightly fast. And sometimes it can take you ten minutes to sit there and watch your calf
because it will breathe fast and then breathe normally, and then breathe fast. Catching things like pneu-
monia at that stage is far better than six hours later, you know, because the damage can already be done.And yeah, smell is another along with scour. Like you can just smell that straightaway …[it has] a real
pungent like rotten smell.
The importance of patience and attention to detail therefore reveals a complicated relationship
between different temporalities of farming and AMR prevention. Protocols enact both fast and
slow timescapes, showing how different temporalities of care intra-act with one another on afarm. Taking care can mean engaging in slower practices, but also those associated with the
urgency of productivism, or what we refer to as ‘patient urgence ’. As the following section
shows, patient urgence is a critical skill to acute dilemmas of care, but these temporal accommoda-tions are not without their own politics or tensions.
Tubing colostrum and the tensions of patient urgence
If productivist timescapes simultaneously accommodate urgency and patience, this is not withouttension. This is exposed in the second feeding practice that helps avert future threats of AMR.
Tubing involves force-feeding colostrum to a calf to ensure it has the necessary volume in the1004 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
ﬁrst hours of its life. Tubing may also be used to provide other ﬂuids, such as electrolytes, to help a
calf recover from illness. In practice, tubing involves preparing a bag of colostrum (hence tubing
may also be referred to as ‘bagging ’), gripping a calf securely between the calf rearer ’s legs, and
then inserting a tube into the oesophagus and pouring the colostrum directly into the stomach.
This is a skilled task that should be conducted by trained staff (AHDB, 2020). Dangers includeinserting the tube into the windpipe and lungs, and killing a calf by drowning. In this way,
tubing re ﬂects a productivist timescape in which care is enacted as rapid and urgent, if not
violent and dangerous:
I just tubed this calf like normal, and next thing it started coming out of its nose and it dropped dead …
This calf was just like choking on the ﬂoor, and I just didn ’t know what to do. I just stood there and I
thought shit, I can ’t believe it. And all I could say was, it was in the right hole, I could feel it. It was in the
right hole because I felt it go down, I would not have tipped the milk in if I didn ’t feel the thing go
Back in the calf shed, the calf has still not drunk. It ’s time for emergency care. Amber had been dreading this: the only
way to save her now is to force feed her using a tube. She ’s done this before when every calf was tubed following an
outbreak of rotavirus. She didn ’t think they liked it and worried about hurting them, but reasoned that it is for the best.
Two of her colleagues are helping. One prepares a bag of colostrum, whilst Amber places the tube against the calf togauge how far it should be inserted into oesophagus. The other holds the calf upright –it’s too weak to stand. The calf is
wearing a ﬂeece jacket to keep her warm, and there ’s fresh bedding to give the calf the best chance of avoiding bacteria.
Slowly, Amber inserts the tube to the length she had measured. Initially, the calf does not object, and the colostrumbegins to pour in. But soon the calf begins to wriggle and emits a loud belch, sounding more like a sheep than a calf.Amber whispers to the calf, “it’s alright, it ’s alright ”. More belching follows, the calf throwing her head upwards and
sideways. Jane says she can ’t hold her up much longer. Just as Amber says, ‘that ’ll do ’, the calf collapses onto her side
and into the bedding. ‘She fell ’says Jane, ‘I couldn ’t keep her up ’. Amber laughs nervously, not sure whether tubing the
calf will provide the care it needs or not.Enticott and O ’Mahony 1005
through my ﬁngers …. You feel so bloody bad because you are responsible for their life, and you ’ve just
snuffed it out in ﬁve minutes. And it was a good calf as well (Hayley).
Tubing provides urgent care as well as the ability to monitor the intake of colostrum, unlike feeding
from the teat. This could also be achieved by bottle feeding, but this slows down care. Bottles must
be sterilised and cleaned before their next use, all of which disturbs the ﬂow of productivist time.
Patience in bottle feeding is also required because not all calves readily take to sucking and need tobe taught. As noted above, this can be attributable to poor mothering by the cow, or the fact that the
calf may not have learnt to suck because they were separated at birth in order to prevent the trans-
mission of disease. The solution to these challenges within productivist timescapes lies in tubing aspart of a neonatal feeding protocol which may routinely specify tubing when calves are ‘slow’fol-
lowing dif ﬁcult births:
I have plenty of calves, especially this year, when they ’ve had this Selenium and iodine thing and
they’re all very slow. And, and if they are, if we ’re not sure now, if we ’re not sure that they have
drunk properly, we will just tube them automatically, that ’s what we ’ll do. And then they ’ll get the
full bag (Hayley).
A routine reliance on tubing can be choreographed by the temporal order of the farm (Law and Lien,
2014), especially the lack of time or human labour available to constantly monitor how much colos-trum has been consumed, or a desire to be present (or not) when calving occurs during the night.
While some farms have individuals whose sole role is to care for calves, the marginal status of
calves means that many do not or attending to them is undermined by other on-farm priorities.The wider organisation of calving contributes to this lack of time: farms that use a block calving
system, or experience a glut of calvings, may routinely tube calves to help manage the workload
during calving. Eleanor, for instance explained her routine approach to tubing in these terms:
So where possible, mother ’s milk goes to baby, and every calf gets tubed with the milk for the colos-
trum. Because when you ’ve got 15 to 20 [being born] in a day, you just need to bang that colostrum in. It
needs to go in as soon as possible. So, we tube just to save faf ﬁng about, and then we know that that calf
has had its ﬁrst couple of litres of colostrum and it ’s good to go. So that ’ll be done as soon as possible
after calving …If, you know, it ’s sucked from its mum, great, and it might not have that much. But
generally, everything gets tubed twice before we start feeding it.
Amongst calf rearers, tubing highlights the tensions that productivist time places on care. For some,
tubing should be a last resort because of the perceived pain of forcing a tube into a calf ’s stomach.
Such a practice of care, then, can be discomforting and distressing for both calf and rearer. At thesame time, tubing ’s urgency enacts a future of care, providing the antibodies to ﬁght off infection
and reduce the likelihood of future antibiotic interventions. Ellen for example described this contra-
diction thus:
The one thing I still hate doing to this day, is to tube them. I ﬁnd that pretty dif ﬁcult just because the
calves don ’t really like it, and I think they ’re a little bit sensitive and things like that. And, but sometimes
it’s got to be done because they won ’t drink and if they don ’t have a feed, then they ’ll get dehydrated …
It just makes me feel a bit sad because I think that I ’m hurting them, and I don ’t want to hurt them …but
I guess it ’s for the greater good.
Thus, tubing provides a form of care for the calf rearer themselves, providing reassurance and peace
of mind that the calf has had the best start to a healthy, resilient life. In this way, tubing can1006 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
simultaneously symbolise both good care and lack of care. Tubing ensures the calf is healthy, but
the need to tube re ﬂects the excesses of productivism (cf. Haggerty et al., 2009), and potentially the
absence of time and practical skills that calf rearers should possess to care less intrusively. Being
patient and paying attention to the calf –fostering ‘somatic sensibilities ’–is one way of avoiding
tubing. This gives calves time to feed on their own terms by giving them a chance. Patience there-
fore means deviating from the rapid timescape of productivism and making exceptions to feeding
protocols based on the situation at hand. Other caring materialities may also be employed to avoidtubing: calf jackets, for example, can help keep calves warm and remain healthy rather than suc-
cumbing to infections and loss of appetite that tubing may help resolve. Whilst these skills and tech-
nologies help calf rearers avoid tubing, they can also help calf rearers spot other health problems byvirtue of the amount of time they can spend with them:
So as long as they ’re making a little effort, they ’ve obviously got a little bit of something about them
wanting to get better, and forcing stuff into them just maybe isn ’t the right thing to do. So, if they ’re
willing to take a litre, but maybe not going to drink three, at least they ’ve got something on board, and
nine times out of ten you go back to feed them at the next feed stage and that ’s done some good (Lucy).
We take a lot longer to get them going on the bottle and the last resort is to bag them. We realise it takes a
lot longer to get going, the lads are like shove the bottle in their mouth and try and get them going, if
they’re not they bag them …[And] because we ’re with them all the time we spot when something ’s not
right, they associate us as being their mum, we ’d sit there and play with them whereas the lads are like
oh, come on, do some work (Amber).
As Amber notes, patience also con ﬂicts with the productivist ideals of ‘real work ’: hugging, playing
and just ‘messing around ’with calves appear to have no productive value despite their role in calf
health. This is the difference between protocol care, and compassionate care which involves “actually
thinking about that animal as a sentient being rather than just an item, a product ”(Laura, vet). This is
made evident by Amber telling the calf ‘It’sa l r i g h t ’as she tubes her. Indeed, talking as a practice of
care is evident across calf care: when Amber walks into the shed and announces “Hi baby ”to the calf,
it allows her to check on their reactions. Calves also learn and recognise individual rearers, and com-
munication with new-borns is understood as a means of cultivating mutual trust. Talking to calves
often goes hand in hand with naming them which, although calf rearers suggest that they shouldn ’t
because of the emotional bonds it creates, allows them to learn from their reactions. These caring prac-
tices join two temporal worlds, the patient and the urgent, allowing both to live with each other, as
well as assuage moral injuries caused by tubing and other acts of productivist time.
In contrast, the dismissal of patient skills re ﬂects how care is embedded in and sustains speci ﬁc
forms of agrarian political economy and labour at the expense of others (Reisman, 2021). In calf
care, productivist timescapes are not only dif ﬁcult to change, but also choreograph the very pro-
blems that calf rearers are trying to resolve. The low priority given to calf rearing means that
there is commonly neither enough time nor space to look after calves appropriately:
Youﬁnd that this calf is being left in a dry cow yard, and it ’s wandering around trying to ﬁnd its mum,
and they lick the walls, and they follow other cows which are not their mum. And by the time the farmer
picks them up in the morning, they could be a bit hungry, but they …they go off the boil a bit, they …
they’re very keen to suck as soon as they ’re born, but twelve hours later, or even six hours later, they ’re
not. So, the suck re ﬂex just diminishes …You could even go mad and actually clean the cow ’s udder,
you know …just put a wet wipe over their udder so that the ﬁrst feed the calf gets isn ’t a mouthful of
muck. But people are reluctant to adopt these regimes because it takes up more space in the dry cow yard
(Pauline).Enticott and O ’Mahony 1007
If there is not enough time or space to care for calves, then as Amber alluded, this timescape is
ordered by a socio-cultural timescape in which old-fashioned gendered attitudes determine what
constitutes ‘good farm work ’(Leckie, 1996). Instead, calf rearers working with neo-natal and
young calves –rather than on bespoke integrated units, for example –are frequently women
who often ﬁt rearing around their family and maternal roles and other paid work. They may be
expected to return to the farm at times of crisis to rear calves, but also in doing so care for the con-
tinuity of the farm and the family (Enticott et al., 2022). In this politics of care, caring for calvescannot be optimal as it involves balancing too many competing interests. Thus, Hayley suggests
that accidentally tubing a calf to death was a consequence of her being pregnant and looking
after other young children whilst also managing the calves, as well as having limited time toaccess training to learn how to care:
It’s a massive responsibility, especially when you really don ’t know what you ’re doing. Like, I don ’t
think any of us know what we ’re doing, really. You just kind of like make a series of mistakes and
it’s like each time you don ’t make that mistake again, and then you make another one and you don ’t
make that mistake again, it ’s, I don ’t know, it ’s quite hard work (Hayley)
Similarly, the systemic basis for tubing is evident in the material and spatial choreography of farms
themselves. The legacy of productivist timescapes means that calf sheds are often far from ideal and
reﬂects the prioritisation of productive cows in relation to unproductive calves. Whilst cows occupy
the newest sheds, calves must make do with older sheds, with poor ventilation, that are not designedfor calf rearing:
Some mornings you ’d go in and the beds would be quite damp, even though obviously we were keeping
up with the bedding, and the passageway would be quite wet, and that ’s just purely the rain, like the
prevailing wind coming in. I mean it would hammer it with the wind and rain, and it was prettyintense. So, it was blowing in, so it was moist. It wasn ’t the best, really, environment for fresh air, if
that makes sense. So yeah, there was moisture. I mean it was …yeah, it was an old, old building (Sam).
Hygiene practices such as routine cleaning are compromised: resting sheds is dif ﬁcult because of
the need for continuous use to maintain productivist ﬂow, meaning that bacteria cannot dissipate.
Calf care is therefore directed as much to calves as it is to the infrastructure in order for it to best
accommodate calves. The consequence of these productivist relations is that practices of care
revolve around small incremental adaptions that calf rearers can make. In this form of makingdo and bricolage, old buildings become retro ﬁtted with old materials –fences and barriers are
used to create calf pens, whilst strategically placed hay bales are used to create barriers and
wind breaks to help protect create appropriate ventilation for calves to prevent them succumbingto pneumonia:
We’ve had to put on either sheeted gates, or straw bales inside the pens. Just think of it as a big box and
you basically just put a straw bale here, and they can walk around to go in behind their shelter or they
can come out the front to feed. So just gives them just somewhere to keep warm, because otherwise, Iknow you fed them warm milk, but then if you ’re getting …it’s like standing on a hill. If you ’re not
moving, you ’re just going to get cold. So, we ’re just trying to give her a little bit of protection (Katie).1008 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
The future timescapes of antimicrobial resistance
If the rapid timescapes of productivist agriculture con ﬁgure how calves are cared for, tracing their
politics of care to understand who bene ﬁts at the expense of others (Reisman, 2021) has important
implications for attempts to foster the prudent use of antimicrobial medicines across the industry.Firstly, understanding the timescape of livestock farming exposes the systemic challenges facingattempts to reduce the use of antibiotics. The temporalities of calf rearing and the materialities
and subjectivities they enact are key to understanding these systemic challenges. Thus,
calf rearing can frequently ﬁnd itself in tension with an ‘old’or‘aging ’temporality: it has been
beset by traditional cultural attitudes that it is not productive work, and therefore of limitedvalue. These politics of care are re ﬂected in the way calf rearing is perceived to be women ’sw o r k ,
and which can be organised around other maternal and labour roles. Similarly, this old temporality is
reﬂected in the make-shift buildings and facilities calf rearers must often work with. This does not
mean that it is the same across all farms, or that ne w technologies, practic es and labour conditions
are not being developed and used by calf rearers. Rath er, shifts in the cultural timescape of calving
are taking shape at different pace on different farm s resulting in a differentiated geography of calf care.
Whilst the temporalities of calf rearing come to sustain productivist farming, they have conse-
quences for calf care and AMR: insuf ﬁcient time is available to care appropriately for calves, the
skills of patience and attention to detail are constantly under pressure, and the availability of train-ing opportunities is inadequate. These systemic challenges pose a key problem for the AMR agenda(cf. Bellet, 2018). On the one hand, farming timescapes create conditions in which the use of anti-biotics is inevitable: they enact fragile relationships of care that are easily broken by the absence of
time and presence of past times. In these systems, the use of antibiotics is therefore a ‘normal acci-
dent’(Perrow, 1999); an over ﬂow waiting to happen (Law, 2006). On the other hand, attempts to
encourage behavioural change in relation to AMR on farms conceptualise change as a matter ofcommunication with ‘farmers ’(Bard et al., 2022) and/or the adoption of new technologies. As
we have shown, technological solutions like tubing do not address systemic challenges, ratherthey seek to strengthen existing systems enacting a technoscience future temporality of hope(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015). Yet, adding new materialities to old systems makes them morecomplex, more vulnerable and more likely to over ﬂow (Perrow, 1999). At the same time, these
methods fail to re ﬂect the complex relations that comprise farming timescapes. Indeed, as other
research on calf rearing and animal health demonstrates, systemic change is emotionally driven
(Bassi et al., 2019) or by other social factors in the family (such as succession) (Enticott et al.,
2022; Sutherland et al., 2012), rather than a simple response to communicative stimuli. Thus, inunderstanding farming timescapes, we suggest for AMR initiatives to be successful, attention isturned to these systemic challenges, rather than the future timescapes of technology.
Secondly, the timescapes of calf rearing provide insight into the constitution and nature of care in
agriculture. Care in calf rearing is similar to other agricultural practices. As in soil management
(Krzywoszynska, 2019; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015), care in calf rearing is marked by distinctbut intersecting temporal practices: of slow, patient care versus fast, technoscience care.Similarly, as in the management of animal health (Singleton and Law, 2013), so in calf rearingis care re ﬂected in the patchwork, bricolage tinkering practices of retro ﬁtting and adaption of
calf sheds to ensure that systems work. And, just as (Reisman, 2021: 404) notes, care is multi-faceted, going beyond simply eliminating bacterial pathogens, and focuses on ‘a politics of rela-
tional maintenance: what relations are being sustained, and to what ends? ’. As the calf rearers in
this study revealed, their care was constituted by the relations of political economy and theirrelated timescapes. Thus, whilst their care was focused on calves, where was the care for calf
rearers: who cared for them? Their references to lack of time, being fearful of making mistakes
whilst juggling over responsibilities, and their use of tubing to make themselves as well as theEnticott and O ’Mahony 1009
calf feel better, point to an absence of care for them. Moreover, calf rearers expressed care not just
for the calves, but also through their multiple roles as care givers for the farming family and farm.
At the same time, in following the relations of care in farming timescapes, it is also possible to
see tensions between different temporalities of care, but which can nevertheless be accommodatedwithin an overall timescape. The dominant timescape of productivist agriculture and its excesses
that lead to AMR emphasise speed, ef ﬁciency and urgency. Protocols and feeding technologies
like tubing seek to enact this timescape whilst also seeking to avoid the rebounding risks ofAMR. It is easy to put this caring temporality in opposition to the slower skills of patience and atten-
tion to detail. Yet, this is not an easy opposition, rather these different temporalities ﬁnd themselves
as part of the same system. Caring temporalities are neither fast or slow, but both, the balance ofwhich changes in context and the situation at hand. Thus, the prudent usage of anti-microbials was
commonly associated by our rearers as relating to patience, time and waiting; as well as being atten-
tive enough to respond when necessary. Conversely, responding to infection, particularly somethingwith its own rapid temporalities (such as pneumonia) requires urgency, but an urgency that comes
from patience: spending time and noticing symptoms, or listening to the calves and picking up on
wheezing or a cough. Crucial to the attempts to encourage the prudent use of antibiotics is, therefore,the development of these different temporal sensibilities –what we have referred to as ‘patient
urgence ’–, the recognition and accommodation of the tensions between competing temporalities,
andﬁnding ways for calf rearers to experiment and ﬁnd the balance between them.
Finally, Haraway (2008) suggests that recognising the presence of care in unlikely settings (such
as laboratories) is important in developing an ethics of care and ‘response-ability ’through slower
practices such as attention and patience. Whilst there may be similarities between the ethics of carein laboratories and productivist farms (Greenhough and Roe, 2011: 55), a ﬁnal question our
research raises is why are these ethics of care found on some farms and not others? What stimulates
their presence? The experimentation with protocols to avoid tubing was not present on all farms.Similarly, where tubing protocols were present, tubing could be conducted reluctantly with calf
rearers concerned about the reasons for its use. This signi ﬁes the presence of a different range of
farming timescapes and affective atmospheres that are important to understand in attempts tomanage AMR. Previous studies of AMR in farming and calf care either focus solely on intensive
agriculture (Helliwell et al., 2020) or fail to differentiate between different farming systems
(Palczynski et al., 2022). Paying greater attention to the differentiated evolution of the timescapesof care –or care-full timescapes –may therefore help understand the breeding of patient urgence –
and other temporal tensions and accommodations –that are better placed to ensure responsible calf
care.
Conclusion
To ask how to feed a calf is to ask, what is it to care in livestock agriculture? Feeding calves enactsthe timescapes of modern livestock farming, reminding us of its excesses and rebounding risks.
Promoting the use of colostrum to reduce the use of antibiotics asserts a timescape in which
feeding is con ﬁgured by standardisation, consistency, and urgency. Feeding practices such as
tubing entrench productivist temporalities, enacting urgent care as a means to ensure the producti-
vistﬂow of calf to cow in the smoothest way possible. At the same time, feeding colostrum sym-
bolises temporal ﬂuidity: urgent feeding practices can give way to slower, patient and situated
practices of care that have been developed in situ (Hinchliffe et al., 2021). In this way, different
caring temporalities come to co-exist as ‘patient urgence ’, making protocols workable, and per-
forming care for calf rearers themselves by allowing them to live with the emotional and practicaldemands of agricultural work. In doing so, understanding the timescapes of calf rearing highlights
how the reduction of AMR may be less about individual actions, and more about the material, social1010 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
and biological relations that con ﬁgure them. If calf rearers are de ﬁned by attention to detail and
patience, then so should efforts to contain AMR pay attention to systemic practices that have
become embedded and require longer term change (Bellet, 2018). The cultural status of calves
and calf rearers, the genetic evolution of bovids, and their material living conditions all demandattention. Thus, if feeding calves is to understand care within livestock farming, then it is to also
direct attention to what sustains systems of agriculture, and how best to repair them.
Highlights
Livestock care on farms is con ﬁgured by different temporal orders known as a timescape.
Urgent temporalities specify productivist technologies to reduce the use of anti-microbial
medicines
Patient temporalities specify slower embodied and situated practices to prevent disease outbreaks
In livestock farming, these different temporalities co-exist within agricultural timescapes render-
ing time as ﬂuid.
The concept of “Patient Urgence ”is developed to show how discordant temporal orders are
accommodated in farm animal care.
