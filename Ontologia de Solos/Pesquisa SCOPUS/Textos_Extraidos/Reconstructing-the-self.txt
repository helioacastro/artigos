Reconstructing the ‘self’: representation tactics for 
multispecies empathy

ABSTRACT
Humans have been accelerating biodiversity loss through spatial changes 
in land and sea use. Pursuing resource accumulation and exploitation, 
nation-states have relied on human-centric policy and development. 
Professionals shaping the built environment—architects, landscape archi -
tects, engineers, and urban planners—are uniquely positioned to help 
humans envision coinhabiting with the more-than-human world. This 
essay argues that fostering multispecies empathy —the cognitive and 
emotional capacity to feel as other beings—is essential for this vision. 
Drawing on Dr. Petra Tschakert’s heuristic framework for ‘encountering 
the Unknown Other’ , Indigenous scholarship, landscape architecture, and 
other fields, this essay contends that humans must perceive themselves 
as extensions of their more-than-human counterparts to empathise with 
other beings. Using this conceptual orientation, designers can foster 
multispecies empathy through representation tactics, such as relational 
space-time , more-than-human agency , and co-labour  =  co-flourishing .
Biodiversity loss and the role of design
In More-than-Human Stories , Emily O’Gorman and Andrea Gaynor discuss both the ontological 
divide and the material entanglements between the ‘human’ and the ‘more-than-human’ within 
environmental humanities (O’Gorman & Gaynor, 2020 ). Advancing a relational framework, they 
advocate for human and more-than-human histories as co-constituted systems, mutually shaping 
and transforming one other. While O’Gorman and Gaynor credit philosopher David Abram with 
introducing the concept of the ‘more-than-human world’ in his 1996 book, Spell of the Sensuous  
(O’Gorman & Gaynor, 2020 , p. 716), the ‘more-than-human’ term has become interchangeable 
with other terms, such as ‘non-human. ’ The authors of Field Guide to the Patchy Anthropocene  
define the ‘more-than-human’ as encompassing humans, non-human living entities, and non-living 
forces, such as ‘petrochemicals, volatile dust particles, or phosphorus fertilisers, the characteristics 
of which nonetheless have the capacity to bring about change in the world’ (Tsing et  al., 2024 , 
p. 259). While acknowledging the inseparability of humans and their co-constituents, this essay 
distinguishes between humans and ‘more-than-human’ to scarify reciprocal responsibilities and 
obligations woven in these relationships. Moreover, while the essay honours the spirit, agency, 
and vibrancy of all matter (Bennett, 2010 ; Hutton, 2019 ), its primary focus is on non-human

living beings. These beings form one thread of a complex web requiring human empathy and 
ethical obligations in the face of anthropogenic climate impacts and biodiversity loss.
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services defines 
biodiversity loss as a ‘reduction of any aspect of biological diversity in a particular area through 
death, destruction or manual removal; it can refer to many scales … resulting in decreased total 
diversity at the same scale’ (IPBES, n.d.). Significant unfolding biodiversity loss has raised concerns 
on whether we are experiencing a sixth mass extinction. Although scientists acknowledge a 
baseline level of extinction, known as ‘background extinction, ’ conservative calculations estimate 
that the ‘average rate for vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 144 times higher 
than the background rate’ (Ceballos et  al., 2015 , p. 1). Invertebrate loss may be even higher 
given the significant gaps in our knowledge of these species. According to the 2018 Red List 
of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation (IUCN), vertebrates make up 
67% of assessed species, while invertebrates account for only 2% (Eisenhauer et  al., 2019 ). 
More-than-human worlds have been disproportionately studied for reasons ranging from char -
ismatic species biases (Tschakert, 2022 ), or ‘spatial and taxonomic biases’ (Eisenhauer et al., 2019 , 
p. 1), to conservation cultural constructs and values of the time (Mace, 2014 ). Despite unprec -
edented extinction rates, biodiversity loss is generally untethered from anthropogenic climate 
science conversations, limiting our understanding of their intertwined drivers and impacts.
One of the most cited international goals tackling climate change has been the 2016 Paris 
Agreement, which aims to ‘limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels’ (The Paris 
Agreement, n.d.). In response, nations have focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
(Mailloux et  al., 2021 ). However, primarily focusing on greenhouse gas emissions does not 
necessarily tackle direct drivers of anthropogenic biodiversity loss, namely ‘land or sea use 
changes, direct exploitation (fishing, logging, hunting), pollution, climate change, and invasive 
species’ (Jaureguiberry et  al., 2022 , p. 2-3). Land or sea use changes, which are spatial drivers, 
therefore become critical to climate science and biodiversity conversations. In recent years, 
scientists and non-profit organisations have begun noting the importance of studying landscapes, 
or the ‘stage, ’ where species live, rather than or in addition to the ‘actors, ’ or the species of 
concern (Eisenhauer et  al., 2019 ; Tack et  al., 2023 ; Zhu et  al., 2023 ) to account for future climate 
change scenarios and climate resilience. While it has been challenging to measure biodiversity, 
and thus precisely define the degree of conservation needed, landscape architect Nina-Marie 
Lister argues that biodiversity can be likened to libraries, holding valuable data reserves that 
inform both human and more-than-human worlds (Lister, 1998 ). For example, even microscopic 
soil-dwelling amoeba have helped scientists advance human health (Baldwin, 2016 ). Consequently, 
these libraries require investment and advocacy to face our increasingly stochastic climate 
conditions (Fraterrigo et  al., 2020 ). Professionals shaping the built environment, from rural to 
dense communities, therefore must foreground more-than-human beings in their designs and 
policies to safeguard critical cultural-ecological relationships.
While international bodies recognise anthropogenic climate change and biodiversity loss as 
interconnected ‘wicked problems, ’ efforts remain focused on substitutions from high to low-carbon 
alternatives. These substitutions-oriented solutions conceal how biodiversity loss drivers spatialise 
uneven political economies (Nightingale et al., 2020 ). Often glossed over in these market-focused 
conversations are the interconnections between cultural and ecological loss. For Indigenous 
peoples, this loss has been vividly clear for millennia. Sheila Watt-Cloutier, then International 
Chair for the Inuit Circumpolar Council, framed climate change as a human rights issue in her 
2005 petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ( Sheila Watt-Cloutier et  al. v. 
the United States of America , 2005 ). In the Arctic, the Inuit people cannot substitute between 
ice thicknesses or wildlife to hunt. If the ice is thin, it breaks and hunters fall to their peril. If 
the wildlife disappears, people starve. Ice grounds and hunting rituals have no substitutes; they 
are intertwined with Inuit peoples’ lifeways. Watt-Cloutier petitioned the United States to address 
its ‘acts and omissions’ contributing to global warming ( Sheila Watt-Cloutier et  al. v. the United 
LANDSCAPE  RESEARCH 3
States of America , 2005 ). Acknowledging that arctic ice melt is not only a threat to the Inuit 
people but to the entire planet, Watt-Cloutier requested ‘the right to be cold’ on behalf of her 
people and more-than-human relations (Watt-Cloutier, 2015 ). The court dismissed the petition. 
Twenty years have passed since the petition hearing, and global political polarisation perennially 
threatens human coexistence with more-than-human beings.
There is no one way to address the deeply enmeshed intricacies of biodiversity loss, but the 
interwoven nature of multispecies fates is evident. While technological substitution markets will 
continue to dominate climate change narratives, land use policy and design must also prioritise 
our more-than-human relationships. Architects, landscape architects, engineers, and urban plan -
ners are uniquely positioned to help humans envision coinhabiting with the more-than-human 
world. For instance, developers transform landscapes by razing topography, vegetation, and any 
elements that do not acquiesce to the standard bearer of housing or commercial developments. 
Agricultural landowners, facing economic pressures, overwork their soils at the expense of 
wildlife and macroinvertebrate systems. Policymakers continue to displace racially and ethnically 
minoritized peoples (Chan et  al., 2021 ) and more-than-human beings (Kay et  al., 2022 ) by 
implementing top-down construction projects. In these market transactions, humans lose access 
to the outdoors, as well as a sense of individual and collective identity (Beery et  al., 2023 ). 
Designers working in the built environment have an obligation to existing site inhabitants. 
Landscape architects, in particular, mediate between humans, plants, and wildlife, wielding 
significant power over what remains or is removed from a landscape. Beings displaced or 
remaining then set the stage for how residents relate to their human and more-than-human 
counterparts.
In Staying with the Trouble , Donna Haraway discusses the need for relational worlding, acknowl -
edging our multispecies entanglements. Relational worlding can be characterised as 
‘becoming-with’ (Haraway, 2016 ) or ‘co-becoming’ (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2022 , p. 187), as well as 
entailing both grieving and imagining-with (Haraway, 2016 ; Rasmussen, 2024 ; Tschakert, 2022 ). 
When designers draw to think, market proposals to clients, or share ideas with a public audi -
ence, their drawings articulate a range of possibilities. Designers, such as Maya Lin, Kate Orff, 
Joyce Hwang, and Nina Marie-Lister advocate for multispecies assemblages in their research 
and practice (Hwang, 2022 ; Kolodziejski, 2015 ; Lister et  al., 2015 ; Rehak, 2012 ). However, most 
built projects have a human-centric focus and narrowly prescribe how people can inhabit land -
scapes. In her book, Ruderal City , Anthropologist Dr. Bettina Stoetzer describes how walking, 
picnicking, or running have become sanctioned ‘tools of governance’ for ‘making citizens’ in the 
city of Berlin (Stoetzer, 2022 , p. 105). While improving people’s well-being, recreation as the 
primary source of interaction with the built environment can obscure meaningful relationships 
with the landscape and more-than-human inhabitants. Alternatively, drawings can tell different 
stories, those of multispecies entanglements encompassing shared joy and grief. In turn, this 
may prompt human empathy with other beings, what I call multispecies1 empathy . While empathy 
has conceptually been studied widely in business marketing, user experience design, psychology, 
and architecture, it has largely focused on human-to-human relationships. Multispecies empathy 
can help us reimagine our obligations to and relationships with other beings.
The role of empathy in spatial planning and design
Since Rachel Carson’s A Silent Spring  sparked environmental policy changes, interest in how 
humans might care for biotic and abiotic beings has grown (Reed & Lister, 2014 ). Through a 
multispecies lens, ‘care’ and ‘justice’ guide human behaviour towards more reciprocal and inten -
tional relationships with other beings (Celermajer et al., 2021 ; Jacobs & Wiens, 2024 ). While such 
relationships are not wholly devoid of friction, they can guide daily practices of relationing with 
our more-than-human neighbours. Dr. Maria Puig de la Bellacasa’s work highlights soil as a 
living and breathing web of organisms, endangered by large-scale, monofunctional agricultural 
4 S. BOLIVAR
land use. By working with and tending to soils, one can recognise their vibrancy as a host to 
and embodiment of time, material, and energy flows. Acknowledging soil agency positions it 
as a subject of care (de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). Working from ‘object’ and towards ‘subject’ is osten -
sibly the crux of the multispecies justice question (Celermajer et al., 2021 , p. 13). Seeing ‘Others’ 
as entities deserving of intrinsic value and rights is foundational to multispecies justice, yet this 
classification has been used as a tool for objectification and domination (Escobar, 2023 ; Tynan, 
2021 ). Landscape architect Dr. Beth Meyer has written about the construction of culture-nature 
binaries as a basis for legitimisation of territorial power and control (Thompson & Steiner, 1997 , 
p. 46). However, most institutions and frameworks do not foster an expansive, relational way 
of being. Trawlwulwuy scholar Dr. Lauren Tynan describes relationality as an active, intentional 
practice, constituting ‘responsibilities with kin’ (Tynan, 2021 , p. 589). Writing about cultural 
burnings within her community, Tynan describes fire not as a management strategy but as a 
kinship-building practice allowing people, fire, and other beings to feel ‘more unified as one’ 
(Tynan, 2021 , p. 602). While visions of more-than-human care, justice, and relationality may 
seem radical, they can shape everyday practices through intentionality. Empathy, as a foundation, 
can help bridge these theoretical ideas and galvanise a multispecies ethics of care.
Empathy involves complex, multifaceted neurological activation and behavioural responses. 
Despite extensive neuroscience and social science research, researchers disagree on how to 
define and measure empathy (Adriaense et  al., 2020 , p. 63). Growing research differentiates 
between ‘emotional empathy’ and ‘cognitive empathy, ’ linking their activation within distinct 
brain regions, while functioning integrally as one system (Asada, 2015 ). In the influential Russian 
Doll Model of empathy, primatologist Dr. Frans De Waal posited how ‘perception-action mech -
anism, ’ (PAM), or a mirroring of neural responses, might form the foundation for nested empa -
thetic responses, each becoming more cognitively complex (Adriaense et  al., 2020 , p. 66). For 
example, De Waal’s model nests emotional contagion and mimicry at the inner core. Emotional 
contagion studies, such as those by Professor of Psychology Elaine Hatfield, have explored how 
people subconsciously regulate their facial, body, and vocal shifts in response to their human 
counterparts, resulting in a synchronised pattern of mimicry (Hatfield et  al., 1993 ). De Waal’s 
model positions perspective-taking at the outer shell. Perspective taking has been studied as 
imagining how another might ‘perceive the situation and feel as a result’ (Batson et  al., 1997 , 
p. 751). Perspective taking also requires emotional regulation and ‘Self-Other distinction’ for 
humans to not feel so much distress that they are overwhelmed and cannot provide aid to the 
Other (Adriaense et  al., 2020 , p. 63; Lambert, 2024 ). De Waal’s nested model may be critiqued 
for interpreting emotion as lesser than or more simplistic when compared to cognition. Alternative 
models, such as Dr. Shinya Yamamoto’s Combination Model, explore empathetic responses 
through non-linear and non-sequential lenses (Yamamoto, 2017 ). Despite the variability in 
empathetic human and more-than-human responses, scientists must reckon with ‘the notion 
that human empirical data serve as a benchmark to which animal data should be compared’ 
(Adriaense et  al., 2020 , p. 76), thus risking perpetuating anthropocentric beliefs and models. 
Empathy remains a widely debated subject matter, requiring more multidisciplinary studies and 
approaches to understand its potential for fostering deeper human and more-than-human 
connections.
In architecture and art, empathetic relationing has been identified as Einfühlung , a German 
term for ‘feeling into…to describe an embodied response to an image, object, or spatial envi -
ronment’ (Koss, 2006 , p. 139). Philosopher Robert Vischer described how the art viewer could 
become wholly transformed, their ‘identity destabilized’ (Koss, 2006 , p. 139) despite the other 
not being physically present (Ganczarek et  al., 2018 , p. 141). Sculpture artists have been incisively 
effective in this effort. For example, Kara Walker’s ‘A Subtlety, ’ or the Marvelous Sugar Baby , 
confronts viewers with the United States’ legacy of slavery and otherizing of Black women 
(Walker, 2014 ). Through the monumental scale and commanding pose of the sphinx woman, 
the Marvelous Sugar Baby  temporarily enfolds viewers into contemplating the nation’s 
LANDSCAPE  RESEARCH 5
entanglements with White supremacy. While artists have generally been undaunted by provoc -
ative storytelling, architects have been more confined by tacit rules of polite public discourse. 
However, to unmoor people from comfortable tropes regarding coexistence with otherized 
beings, storytelling needs to account for complex cognitive and emotional empathy. For design -
ers who want to represent more-than-human entanglements to a public audience, this means 
a delicate negotiation between fostering empathetic responses while strengthening human 
resolve to embrace alternative futures. In this context, empathy plays a critical role in shaping 
stories, spaces, and visions, serving as a bridge between the self and other.
Empathy can be characterised as a guiding tenet of spatial planning and design. Prior to 
sketching spatial possibilities, designers must consider the physical or neurological abilities of 
their stakeholders. It is an exercise of decentring the self while acknowledging the responsibil -
ities of the self to the other. Ideally, designers would get to know project stakeholders or even 
be part of their communities, but this latter scenario is rare. More often, driven by geographical, 
monetary, or time constraints, designers must rely on their imagination to take the perspectives 
of others (Sandman et  al., 2022 ). While empathising with unfamiliar groups of people is not 
insurmountable, relating to other species requires humans to interrogate their deeply rooted 
beliefs in their exceptionalism. Recent research finds that human may have a preference for 
beings that are closest in ‘phylogenetic distance, ’ prioritising primates and mammals over inver -
tebrates and plant life (Miralles et  al., 2019 , p. 2). Despite worries about anthropomorphising 
more-than-human beings, the study by Miralles et  al. assessed that humans exhibit more 
empathy and compassion with those they perceive to have external human-like features. For 
design and conservation practitioners, these findings suggest the need to foster multispecies 
empathy while also foregrounding humans’ individual and collective responsibilities towards 
more-than-human beings (Tschakert, 2022 ).
Building on social and neuroscientific empathy studies, as well as deep ecology and multi -
species ethnography, Dr. Lauren Marie Lambert has proposed an ecological empathy model to 
address ‘human-nature (re)connections’ (Lambert, 2024 , p. 1). Her framework outlines six 
sub-competencies needed to cultivate ecological empathy: personal embeddedness, body embed -
dedness, ecological embeddedness, more-than-human perspective taking, more-than-human 
temporal perspective taking, and more-than-human sensing and listening. In defining these 
competencies, Lambert also suggests applicable exercises, some of which resonate with the 
design fields. For example, creating systems thinking maps and integrating more-than-human 
perspectives early in design processes can elevate more-than-human registers (Lambert, 2024 , 
p. 8). While these competencies have great potential to reshape human and more-than-human 
relationships, this framework suggests all six competencies are prerequisites to attain ecological 
empathy. In contrast to developing a singular methodology, landscape architects Sean Burkholder 
and Karen Lutsky speculate how probing the landscape might lead one to plural methodologies 
with unexpected questions and scenarios (Burkholder & Lutsky, 2017 ). Inviting serendipity, their 
self-described curious methods  physically engage with and are attuned to landscape agents. 
Through inquiry and insights gained, Lutsky and Burkholder record their impressions, which 
then leads to greater inquiry. Such playfulness and openness are fertile grounds for building 
more-than-human empathy and learning from the landscape.
Indigenous scholars, such as Dr. Kim TallBear, Dr. Linda Tuhiwai Smith, and Dr. Zoe Todd, 
have long foregrounded the role that other inhabitants and our surroundings play as relations, 
kin, and teachers (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2022 ; Smith, 1999 ; Todd, 2017 ). In Jagged Worldviews 
Colliding , Dr. Leroy Little Bear states, ‘ … Aboriginal languages allow for talking to trees and 
rocks, an allowance not accorded in English. If everything is animate, then everything has spirit 
and knowledge. If everything has spirit and knowledge, then all are like me, then all are my 
relations’ (Bear, 2000 , p. 78). To see one’s more-than-human neighbour as kin or as a relation 
requires deep empathy and love, which can only take place through the labour of continuously 
showing up (hooks, 2000 ). Such complex cognitive-emotional states and processes do not 
6 S. BOLIVAR
happen automatically or in a vacuum. Nor will they take place if humans continue to view 
themselves as separate from their more-than-human neighbours. While acknowledging that 
otherizing can have harmful effects for all, this author also recognises that people’s construction 
of the ‘self’ influences how they perceive themselves, their roles in society, and their ability to 
change their life outcomes (Sedikides, 2021 ). Thus, while destabilising or decentring the self 
might lead to empathy, completely dissolving the self might lead to the inability to cope with 
challenging life situations, much less provide consolation to others. In the following section, 
building on geographer Dr. Petra Tschakert’s work, I probe how the self-other might become 
recontextualized to bridge binaries while maintaining degrees of separation.
From ‘the other’ to the constituted other: re-constituting systems
Geographer and anthropologist Petra Tschakert has written extensively about human and 
more-than-human relationships, developing a rich, multifaceted framework for building relational 
spaces (Tschakert, 2022 ). Tschakert offers a heuristic of ‘four types of encounters—visual, embod -
ied, ethical, and political—to engage with Distant and Unknown Others’ (Tschakert, 2022 ,  
p. 279). Tschakert’s heuristic for multispecies justice is additive and non-linear; it does not 
necessitate a visual encounter to lead into an ethical one. Her works builds on Dr. Nino Antadze’s 
exploration of humans’ ethical and ‘moral engagement with the Unknown Other. ’ Antadze’s work, 
in turn, draws on philosopher Dr. Emmanuel Levinas’s work, who wrote about humans’ ethical 
obligation to the Other as they are face to face (Antadze, 2019 , p. 42). In this physical encounter 
with the defenceless other, people become aware of others’ suffering and cannot turn away. In 
Antadze’s view, climate change effects are distributed in such a way that it is difficult to identify 
and account for all impacted beings; they are the Unknown Other, beings with vulnerabilities 
and the ability to experience suffering (Antadze, 2019 , p. 43). To effectively empathise with 
these Unknown Others, Antadze argues they must have a face or a ‘representation of an expe -
rience of otherness’ (Antadze, 2019 , p. 42). These frameworks are critical for designers who often 
represent fictions and future spaces, which then become the lived experience. While designers 
typically draw fictions with positivist messaging, they can also engage in more speculative 
worldbuilding that envisions more-than-humans shaping those spaces. To do so, designers must 
represent what entails the ‘face, or identity, experience, and voice of the Unknown Other’ in 
ways that also foster multispecies empathy (Antadze, 2019 , p. 38).
Tschakert’s walking journeys and conversations with rural Australian inhabitants reveal the 
diverse narratives surrounding climate impacts. These narratives range from ‘future-oriented 
optimism’ to ‘apocalyptic discourse balanced by anticipatory acts of hope’ and ‘postapocalypse, ’ 
where the assumption is that ‘catastrophe is already upon us’ (Tschakert et  al., 2024 , p. 2). 
Whether humans stand on the brink of collapse or have already crossed it, climate change 
narratives must navigate the emotional complexity of loss, mourning, and hope (Tschakert et al., 
2024 ). While acknowledging differences is crucial, the act of ‘otherizing’ risks further marginalising 
beings, perpetuating inequities, and minimising accountability and opportunities for 
becoming-with. However, ignoring differences and failing to confront the supremacist legacies 
of destruction and harm carries its own set of risks. As philosopher Sylvia Wynter observes, 
‘only certain people are given the privilege of entertaining humanity’ (Tsing et  al., 2024 , p. 31). 
Black, Indigenous, and melanin-rich peoples have historically been otherized and stripped of 
their voices and political power through nation-state building projects (Scott, 1998 ). Creating 
an empathetic and just world requires confronting several existing mental models:
1. Human beings feel exceptional to other beings, obscuring how human and more-than-
humans are intricately connected (Gagliano, 2018 ; Tschakert, 2022 ; Tsing et  al., 2024 ).
2. Humans implicitly favour beings with human-like features and tendencies, perpetuating 
anthropocentric belief systems (Gagliano, 2018 ; Miralles et  al., 2019 ).
LANDSCAPE  RESEARCH 7
3. Humans contain, simplify, commodify, and erase ‘the Other’ in pursuit of individualistic 
agendas, accelerating climate impacts and disproportionately burdening vulnerable pop -
ulations (Celermajer et  al., 2021 , p. 6; TallBear, 2019 ; Tuana, 2019 ).
Designers must go beyond these mental models by considering the Distant and Unknown 
Other, listening to and staying attuned to the stories reverberating beneath the surface, beyond 
their immediate grasp.
Working from Tschakert’s heuristic (Tschakert, 2022 ) and Antadze’s framework (Antadze, 2019 ), 
designers can bridge the imaginary but palpable gulf between Self and Other by a slight recon -
figuration to recognise their connectedness and inseparability ( Figure 1 ). The Self becomes a 
Constituted Self, a contextually aggregated and relational self. By recognising humans are made 
of and informed by their surroundings, humans can verbalise and manifest their obligation to 
the Other within them. The Constituted Other consumes the Other and Unknown Other to rec -
ognise an identifiable and distinguishable Other that is, in fact, a dispersed extension of the self. 
Vice versa, the Other disperses into the Self. Together, these two attractors work in concert to 
create Constituted Systems, a permutation of identifiable and unknown relational beings. 
Constituted Systems acknowledge that humans are made whole  by others and vice versa, some 
of which are identifiable and some of which are, in Antadze’s view, Unknown. Despite their 
unknowability, it does not make them less worthy of a relational understanding and practice. 
This construct assumes that the Self and Other function in relation to a cosmos of known and 
unknowable beings. While this working construct flattens or folds some of Tschakert’s quadrant 
vertices, it does not flatten the criticality of a heuristic to thread the Self and Other. Perhaps 
through such a reconfiguration, humans might begin to feel as Other  rather than for or with 
Other . Dr. Tynan notes how ‘community members and scholars … have reframed the notion of 
“Caring for Country” to become “Caring as Country”’ (Tynan, 2021 , p. 602). Building from a rela -
tional lens, the following case studies explore how designers might integrate representation tactics 
that engage with Tschakert’s visual heuristic for enhanced more-than-human relationships.
Deploying representation tactics
While the possibility of multispecies empathy (engaging with the Distant Other) might revolve 
around Tschakert’s four heuristics, I focus on the visual one as it is the predominant purview 
of designers, who must make a visually compelling design case to clients and stakeholders.

One should note that the visual format can exclude people with vision impairment or who 
have colour-blindness. However, if combined with other multi-sensory stimuli, designers can 
create rich, complex stories that evoke more-than-human entanglements. For example, this 
might encompass illustrating how trees require continuous care by showcasing community 
residents pruning mature trees or watering saplings even while eating their fruit or climbing 
tree limbs. Although some might worry about tree climbing or fruit littering streets, embracing 
plural forms of interacting with the built environment moves people beyond the norms that 
have constrained human and more-than-human relationships. These visual encounters, through 
their medium and content, can lead people to contemplate how to better coexist with their 
more-than-human neighbours.
Socioculturist Vlad P . Glăveanu has discussed how ‘the possible is mediated’ and how this 
mediation can ‘transform the self’ (Glăveanu, 2023 ). Building on this thinking, anthropologist 
Arturo Escobar has speculated that the 1492 Columbian conquest expedition inadvertently 
colonised our concept of what is possible (Escobar, 2023 ). The European colonisation and 
‘civilization’ project, with its complex hierarchical categories for subjugating the Other, ‘pro -
duced a very narrow notion of reality’ (Escobar, 2023 , p. 57). Conceptualising linear 
spatio-temporal progress with modernity as its end goal, hegemonic powers espouse a 
‘One-World View’ that purports one reality, rather than multiple realities or possibilities (Escobar, 
2017 , p. 86). Therefore, to imagine the possible demands a great ontological lift. And while 
the possible might encompass the future, it should also encompass all ripples of time. To 
imagine the future and remove the past is to reduce history to a singular lens. Geographer 
Doreen Massey posits that ‘in the case of relational space-time, phenomena, relations, and 
space-time are mutually constitutive’ (Massey, 2001 , p. 260). While we humans may imagine 
ourselves as bounded spatial beings in a particular point of unidirectional time, matter and 
energy transverse and surround us at multiple spatio-temporal scales. And space-time cannot 
be imagined as bounded sites in bounded time. They must be relational. Thus, the first rep -
resentation tactic can be characterised as ‘relational space-time’ (Massey, 2001 ; Tschakert, 
2022 ). Temporal and spatial together evoke the necessity of representing a space becoming-with , 
as Donna Haraway espouses in her work (Haraway, 2016 ). Space is not static or changing 
according to a singular construct of time; rather, it is overlapping worlds and dynamics, 
necessitating representation of a landscape’s transformation alongside other beings, both 
abiotic and biotic.
When examining visual renderings, most landscapes are visualised as mature; trees have 
grown to their full stature, planting is lush, and cultural programming is at high capacity. These 
representations provide a sense of instant gratification and relief for developers and stakeholders, 
who, understandably, want their communities to feel complete . However, such drawings also 
release developers, planners, stakeholders, etc. from their obligation to care for their landscapes’ 
wellbeing. If designers could capture multiple temporalities, or relational space-time, in one 
image, it might look something like Figure 2 . This image illustrates a creek erosion-stabilisation 
project where coir logs are being installed and aggressive plants are removed to allow diverse 
plants to flourish throughout the expanse of the image. Granted, this visual still maintains a 
sense of linear time progression, but it attempts to show how the creek evolves over time. 
During a spring 2024 University of Tennessee Knoxville landscape studio, students combined 
plan and perspective, as well as different temporalities of the American Bumblebee, as they 
relate to the different functions and operations of an agricultural landscape ( Figure 3 ). From 
the bumblebees building their nest directly on top of soil, in a tall grassy patch interspersed 
with winter’s woody debris, they then move throughout the farm in search of pollen for their 
colony. During this quest, they help pollinate the tomato crop through their fervent movement. 
Such images attempt to show spaces morphing through different timescales, in relation with 
each other and other beings.
LANDSCAPE  RESEARCH 9
The second representation tactic can be described as recognising ‘more-than-human agency, ’ 
or honouring the ability of more-than-human beings to occupy spaces, move, or behave in 
ways that suit them best. For example, representations generally feature humans and more-than-
human worlds as separate entities, with the more-than-human world subservient to humans. 
Scholar Lauren Tynan writes, ‘Relationality with Country and relationality as an ethos means 
being prepared to listen to messages we may not want or expect to hear’ (Tynan, 2021 , p. 69). 
Our more-than-human neighbours, the waterways, soils, or winds, might seem to revolt one 
day, and how humans respond characterise their empathetic capacity. When humans respond 
with suppression, smothering, or extinguishment methods, this is not, according to ‘Dakota 
understanding of existence … “being in good relation”’ (TallBear, 2019 , p. 25). Rather, these 
methods of control and domination lean closer to settler colonialism and undermine the con -
stant and intentional practice required of ‘caretaking relations’ (TallBear, 2019 , p. 25). If we 
consider projects related to futuring, possibility studies, or any spatio-temporality that is aspi -
rational, we humans must also consider those relations we have irrevocably harmed or continue 
to harm before any fabrication of the ‘future’ can take place.
In the article, The Desert we Eat , professors Montserrat Bonvehi Rosich and Seth Denizen, 
along with their students, Samantha Correia Pires and Michelle Chen, produced a series of 
relational plans and sections, where audiences can better understand how soils are con -
structed of labour, material, and time in the Mezquital Valley of Hidalgo, Mexico (Bonvehi 
Rosich & Denizen, 2023 ) (Figures 4  and 5). These drawings showcase an accumulation of

embedded and embodied processes. Confronting viewers with the manual labour required 
to harvest plants, such as corn and prickly pear, the viewer is invited into a range of 
ethical-political conversations. Latino farmhands work daily in the fields, so that North 
Americans may consume expediently, conveniently, and comfortably. Envisioning a multispe -
cies world, where humans and more-than-human live more reciprocally, intentionally, and in 
kinship with each other does not imply an absence of tension. Rather, kinship implies an 
intense commitment to caretaking relations for generations to come (TallBear, 2019 ). Designers 
can be more intentional in depicting the complexity of relational frameworks. Design firm,

SCAPE, through the Launch School at Floyd Bennet Field, explores how students can learn 
from and alongside other beings ( Figure 6 ). In this image, birds exhibit migratory behaviour, 
which is attuned to behavioural, physiological, climactic, and seasonal changes. People are 
working with oysters and helping the threatened Atlantic horseshoe crab. It is a multispecies 
extravaganza that does not shy away from the potential, albeit delightful, strangeness of 
such interactions.

Building on relational space-time and more-than-human agency, the third tactic specifically targets 
human and more-than-human interactions through ‘co-labour  =  co-flourishing, ’ meaning that humans 
must better understand the needs of their more-than-human counterparts so as to care for and 
accommodate them. For this example, I turn again to SCAPE and their oyster-tecture proposal, where 
the oyster, an invertebrate creature, becomes a catalyst for reimagining human relationships with 
coastal dynamics ( Figure 7 ). Through a fuzzy reef lattice seeded with oyster larvae, oysters grow and 
accrete to form complex spatial breakwaters that breed multispecies life, filter water pollutants, and 
protect the harbour from strong wave currents. This relational section demands that people recognise 
how land forms and accretes or merges into other beings, how people care for this tiny creature 
with palpable large-scale effects on their homes, and how this multispecies relationship survives in 
the heart of a city that is constantly remaking itself. In labouring with other critters, labour is rec -
ognised as emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausting, and yet, potentially fruitful in inexplicable 
ways. Holding space for joy, mourning, and emotional ranges in-between acknowledges that rela -
tionality requires practice and patience. We humans can and must transcend a human-centric way 
of thinking and doing to one that honours multiple ways of being.
In viewing our human selves as constituted selves, we acknowledge that we are incomplete 
without the constituted other. Such an orientation opens possibilities for how humans might 
view their own existence as mutually bound to  more-than-human beings’ lifeways (Todd, 2017 ). 
And through this reframing, designers can explore representation tactics that speak to and 
inevitably shape multispecies interactions. While the aforementioned tactics are not exhaustive, 
easily intuited, or defining of a singular approach to multispecies representation, they ask 
designers to continuously probe and speculate on multispecies possibilities. Representations 
depicting more-than-human beings as fellow protagonists might then lead audiences to emo -
tionally and cognitively feel as  other beings (Tynan, 2021 ). How we humans move through the 
world, in light of species loss and suffering, is dependent upon the stories we tell, as are ‘the 
stories we use to tell those stories’ (Haraway, 2016 , p. 12). These stories can become catalysts 
for crafting spatio-temporal worlds that lead into Tschakert’s ethical, political, and embodied 
encounters to engage with the Distant and Unknown Other (Tschakert, 2022 ). While biodiversity 
loss and climate change science can seem enigmatic and paralysing, professionals shaping the 
built environment can help build visions that speak to multispecies co-existence and co-flourishing.

Note
 1. This is an attempt to capture multiple beings, while acknowledging the limitations of bounded scientific 
taxonomies. ‘Multispecies’ is often used as it is becoming a more widely understood concept, but this also 
has taxonomic limitations, and therefore, philosophical, political, and spatial boundaries for relating to 
beings, such as soils and waterbodies.
