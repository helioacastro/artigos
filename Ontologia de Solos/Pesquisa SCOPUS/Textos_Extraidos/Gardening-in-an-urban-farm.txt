Urban gardening ABSTRACT  
Simultaneously perceived as places of agriculture, of nature, and of social ties, urban collective gardens and 
farms enable city dwellers to immerse themselves in gardening, to recover forgotten skills, to learn from nature 
and the environment. They reinstate the soil as a feature of the city by making it visible to the urban population, 
to whom it is often unknown. In this article, we focus on urban gardeners ’ representations of the soil in a city of 
south of France. These representations were analyzed through the lens of the relationships that gardeners 
develop with the soil as an element of nature. Our results highlight relations where the care ethic is central. They 
suggest that the practice and the extension of agroecological urban gardening, by placing city dwellers in 
physical, skilled contact with the soil, promise a reconfiguration of citizens ’ relationship with soil.   
1.Introduction 
In industrialized countries, human relationships with the soil have 
weakened since the industrial revolution. Agricultural soils, closely 
tended for centuries by farmers, have been neglected with the advent 
of chemical fertilizers (Chabert et Sarthou, 2017 ). Considered mainly 
as a support, a substrate to exploit to accelerate productivity, soils 
have suffered substantial damage (Koch and al, 2013; Puig de la Bel-
lacasa, 2014; Artiola et al., 2019 ). This particularly applies to cities, 
where the soil is strongly artificialized and largely invisibilized, con-
cealed under layers of concrete, considered as a degraded environ -
ment, “the heavily disturbed remnants of a once natural soil” 
(Meulemans, 2017 ). The urban design principles of the last centuries 
have promoted practices of systematic earthmoving and water -
proofing, resulting in a historical urban loss of knowledge relating to 
soils, which thus become “non-soils ” (Meulemans and Labat, 2016 ). 
These authors speak of a “double performative movement ”: the soil’s 
disappearance from city dwellers ’ consciousness buries it under con-
crete, and vice versa. 
The Anthropocene, marked by the influence of human beings and the 
process of generalized urbanization, is raising new issues in terms of 
relations between humans and non-humans. Recently, soil health has emerged as a concept to be considered in agriculture, together with the 
organisms that live in and are an essential component of the soil (Besson, 
2011; Bender et al., 2016 ). The rediscovery of the soil is in particular 
linked to its importance in the agroecological production processes that 
have developed as a reaction to industrial agriculture using synthetic 
fertilizers and pesticides. Yet interdependence between man and soils is 
increasingly being taken into account in many spheres, particularly 
scientific and political (Fournil et al., 2018 ).1 In cities, which outsource 
their waste and deplete natural resources, soils are attracting the 
attention of decision-makers because they affect the volume of green -
house gas emissions and promote biodiversity (Guillain and Le Gallo, 
2017 ). Through the role they can play in mitigationg the climate crisis, 
the soil issue is thus becoming politicized. It offers a potential lever for 
rethinking the urban environment, ecologically, socially, and 
aesthetically. 
In parallel, the “agriculturalization ” of the city (Ernwein and 
Salomon-Cavin, 2014 ) is a concept increasingly manifested in attempts 
to reconnect city dwellers to the soil. The practice of agroecological 
gardening in urban collective gardens brings the soil back to the city and 
to the attention of its inhabitants, who often know nothing about it and 
its ecosystem services (Donadieu et al., 2016 ). It makes soils visible 
again, reminds city dwellers of their presence (Chalmandrier et al.,

22017 ). Urban agriculture experiments seeking to cultivate vegetables 
and fruits in collective gardens are popular with city dwellers and can 
change urban living patterns and philosophies. Urban collective gardens 
and farms are places of production, of social ties and well-being; they are 
considered as an interface between city, nature, and agriculture 
(Scheromm, 2015 ; Silva et al., 2016 ; Slavica et al., 2020 ). They allow the 
inhabitants to immerse themselves in an extra-ordinary universe where 
gardening leads them to recover forgotten skills, to learn from nature 
and the environment. They partially compensate for the loss of in-
teractions between human and nature characteristic of urban societies 
(Bendt et al., 2013 ), thereby helping to combat “the extinction of nature 
experience ” (Pyle, 1993 ). These places are therefore considered 
“pockets of socio-ecological memory ” in the urban environment (Barthel 
et al., 2014 ). Donati et al. (2010) perceived urban community gardens 
and farms as “urban geographies in which the mundane and everyday 
practices may produce new and more meaningful connections and net-
works with the more-than-human communities of the city”; they may 
foster new ethical connections between human and non-human in-
habitants, since they represent “hybrid human-natural places ”. As an 
experience of nature that goes beyond mere contact with the latter, 
gardening is even endowed with a transformative power that can go so 
far as to alter the identity of those involved (Clayton et al., 2017 ). 
Although the above reflections suggest that urban collective gardens 
can have a strong impact on the human/soil relationship, little is known 
about the representations that urban collective gardeners have of the 
soil they meet in the gardening experience. The majority of the literature 
approaches gardens ’ soils from the perspective of their contamination 
by toxic chemicals (for example Schwarz et al., 2016 ; Al-Delaimy and 
Webb, 2017 ; Dumat et al., 2018 ). The rise of urban gardening has in fact 
been accompanied by a growing concern about the sanitary quality of 
plants grown on urban soils, due to the presence of pollutants, and this 
question is now being raised by all those involved in the design, devel -
opment and management of urban gardens and farms, including gar-
deners (Grenet et al., 2016; R˘emy et al., 2017 ). 
In this article, we explore urban gardeners ’ representations of the 
soil. City dwellers are key players in the soil issue because the human 
knowledge of soils has direct implications for the future of life on 
Earth (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019 ). Their representations, as a means 
of knowing the world and acting on it (Jodelet, 2003 ), directly in-
fluence practices and ways of living (Abric, 2016 ). Exploring repre -
sentations of the soil and taking them into account should thus 
contribute to the development of sustainable land management, 
especially inside the cities. In the first part, we present our case study, 
a collaborative urban farm in Montpellier (France), and our method -
ology. The second part focuses on the results of interviews conducted 
with the founders of the farm and with members involved in the 
cultivation of the agricultural plot. These results are then analyzed 
through the lens of the relationships that gardeners develop with the 
soil as an element of nature. 
2.Method 
This study of urban gardeners ’ representations of the soil they 
cultivate forms part of a multidisciplinary action-research project 
conducted in 2019/2020. This one-year emerging project brings 
together researchers (two in soil science and two in social sciences), 
leaders and members of an urban farm with an associative status, and 
representatives of the Montpellier intermunicipal body (Montpellier 
M˘editerran ˘ee M˘etropole). Its objective is to contribute to building a 
pool of knowledge on urban soils, permaculture practices, and urban 
agriculture to be shared by scientists, urban political actors, and citi-
zens, and to initiate a collaboration on a pilot experimental site. The 
M˘etropole ’s involvement in the project is linked to its interest in 
approaching the issue of urban agriculture and its soils scientifically. 
The research we present here concerns the social science component of 
the project. The research focused on the members of an urban farm described as " 
collaborative " by its founders, in the city of Montpellier (270,000 in-
habitants), situated in the south of France. Named Oasis citadine, the 
farm was created in 2018 by four young project leaders -between 30 and 
35 years old-, all with higher degrees and complementary skills 
(agronomy, business, personal development) on land provided by a 
winery. While the city’s urbanization has left some wineries standing 
(Scheromm and Soulard, 2018 ), these now blend into the urban fabric, 
surrounded by busy roads and shopping malls. 
The purpose of Oasis Citadine is to initiate urban dwellers into urban 
agriculture and the principles of permaculture.2 Permaculture is about 
working with nature, the soil in particular, rather than against it (Mol-
lison, 1988 ). Applying permaculture principles encourages members to 
think about human-nature relationships, making their representations of 
the soil interesting to analyze. But permacultural gardening is not the 
only activity that the members can practice. Oasis Citadine also offers 
others activities (yoga and tai chi workshops, meals, concerts, confer -
neces and debates through a community caf˘e). It is a place of convivi -
ality where the social contact is privileged. 
A hundred people were registered at Oasis citadine at the time of this 
study, but only about twenty are really involved in gardening activity. 
The members, most living in Montpellier, the majority ranging in age 
from 25 to 40, are mainly middle class and do not work in agriculture. 
The farm covers a plot of 4000 m2 which is designed and organized 
as a collective space, without individual mini-plots. The choice of crops 
is left to the founders, but the members can participate in creating 
planting schemes. Crops are harvested collectively, and shared equitably 
among the members who practice gardening. The project leaders are 
very often to be found at Oasis Citadine cultivating the plot, so informal 
discussions can take place several times a week with members who come 
to garden. 
A set of one- to two-hour interviews were conducted:  
– 4 informative interviews with the project leaders to explore their 
points of view regarding the soil and the content of the messages they 
send to gardeners 
–9 individual comprehensive interviews (on appointment) with gar-
deners to study their representations of the soil.  
– More informal interviews with little groups of gardeners during the 
field work, which enabled the content of the comprehensive in-
terviews to be validated according to the principle of field data 
saturation (Sardan, 1995 ).  
– A feedback meeting to report the findings to the members was held 
after the interviews and their analysis. This meeting, which was also 
attended by ten people who had not been interviewed, confirmed the 
validity of our results. 
All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The informative in-
terviews with the project leaders were conducted to understand the 
context in which the urban gardeners cultivate. The goal of the 
comprehensive interviews with the gardeners was to understand their 
representations of the soil and of its fertility. What soil are they talking 
about? What relationships do they establish with the soil ? How do they 
integrate it into their gardening practice? How do they envisage human 
interventions? 
2 Agroecology is defined as " the application of ecological concepts and 
principles to the design and management of sustainable agroecosystems " 
(Gliessman, 2007 ). It gathers a set of agricultural techniques based on the 
functioning of natural ecosystems. Permaculture matches this scientific defini -
tion of agroecology. Permaculture uses the tools and techniques of agroecology, 
but goes further by proposing a reflection on our relation to the world (Cen-
temeri, 2019 ). Furthermore, Oasis Citadine people use both terms inter-
changeably for their agricultural practices. P. Scheromm and A. Javelle

3.1. Oasis citadine: a site offering training in permaculture and exchanges 
on ecological transition 
The city farm Oasis citadine is defined on its website3 as an experi -
ence to share with friends or family in the natural setting of a winery, 
performing an activity that provides well-being through contact with 
nature. It falls within the “ecological transition challenge to create 
resilient human ecosystems ”, as the website states. The project includes 
not only cultivating the site under permaculture, but also an extensive 
social component, the goal being to create “a social fabric of people 
actively participating in the ecological transition ” (Oasis citadine project 
leader). Multiple issues are addressed: fighting global warming, recon -
necting with nature, with food, creating a place for well-being and for 
social ties, with a view to inclusion (helping people who are trying to 
find their way), transforming an agricultural wasteland into an oasis of 
biodiversity, occupying urban territory to protect it from urbanization. 
Oasis Citadine regularly welcomes environmental-oriented associations, 
which offer workshops to members. 
Tackling global warming is undoubtedly the concern most common 
to the four project leaders: 
“It’s what connects us the most, it’s how we can take concrete action 
on climate change, it’s our greatest motivation ” (Oasis citadine 
project leader). 
The site is seen by the founders as a pilot project aimed at creating a 
network of oases. It is used to test and validate the social, environmental, 
and economic objectives of their model. When thinking about the type of 
support to put in place, the founders analyzed the needs of the members, 
who confided in them their fear of anything time-consuming, their 
desire not to work alone in the garden and to be accompanied by experts 
in the field. 
The permaculture training proposed at Oasis citadine relies mainly 
on practical workshops on the farm (Fig. 1). The soil and its forms of life 
are essential factors to be taken into consideration in permaculture. The 
project leaders emphasize the living dimension of the soil (the earth -
worm is seen as an indicator of soil life: if the earthworm is present, so 
are the other organisms), the natural biological cycles (phosphorus, 
nitrogen, carbon), the provision of nutrients used to feed not only plants 
but also a population of soil organisms that create soil fertility. The idea 
is to see the functioning of plants from a perspective of the functioning of 
the soil. For the trainers, it is fundamental that the gardeners learn to 
look at the soil: look at the clods, the color, the aeration, the argilo- 
humic complex, and the life it shelters: 
“Once you have become aware of soil life, your vision of the technical 
aspects changes because you will have to find material to feed these 
populations, identify what they eat, straw, very woody materials [.], 
to recreate soil balance and autonomy, [.] we must be aware that 
there is a permanent creation of matter ” (Oasis citadine project 
leader) 
The strong message from the project leaders is therefore that it is the 
soil life that matters, more than imported nutrients provided to feed 
plants and increase yields. The trainers recommend feeding the soil 
appropriately, rather than the plants themselves, since a properly 
balanced soil will guarantee proper plant growth. 
3.2. Gardeners ’ representations: respecting and taking care of the soil as a 
habitat for life 
It should be recalled that Oasis citadine is a place of coviviality where members have different degrees of commitment to gardening and where 
other activities are offered (do it yourself jobs like solar hoven con-
struction, or yoga classes for example). This means that interest in 
gardening and intensity of gardening practice can differ greatly among 
Oasis Citadine ’s members. However, they share similar representations 
on a number of features, no doubt due to their regular contact with 
leaders. 
Interviewed members are mainly attracted to the farm by a lack of 
nature in the city, by dissatisfaction with the urban way of life (interest 
in alternative projects to create social ties that may change social 
vision), by a desire to acquire food autonomy. Some are concerned about 
preparing for the aftermath of imminent social collapse.4 Others clearly 
state a need to participate actively in improving environmental 
conditions: 
“I thought, how can I put this into practice to participate a little bit in 
stopping this pollution [.], get involved, personally? ” (gardener, 28 
years old, farm worker) 
Although all the gardeners are interested in permaculture, only one 
intends to make agriculture a profession. They are there for their 
pleasure. 
“It’s fun for me, I like to explore areas that I don’t know and without 
necessarily aiming to become a specialist, I don’t intend to be a 
permaculture pro, that’s not my intention at all” (gardener, 30 years 
old, journalist) 
Some are not confident regarding their gardening practices and rely 
heavily on the skills of the founders, whom they consider experts: 
“I’m more comfortable than when I first arrived, yeah, a little more, I 
still ask anyway so I don’t do anything stupid. ” (gardener, 30 years 
old, translator) 
Most of them state that their perceptions of soil have changed since 
they started attending Oasis citadine: 
“At the time, soil was just ground, we grew things on it, that’s all, and 
now I’m more aware that it’s more complex, that there has to be life 
in it, if you just have dirt there isn’ t much that will grow ” (gardener, 
29 years old, green spaces maintenance worker) 
“Before, I thought soil was above all mineral, now I understand that 
it is above all alive ” (gardener, 30 years old, journalist) . 
The gardeners say they want to try to get closer to the soil, to be more 
in tune with what a gardener call its “terroir ” - a multi-referential 
concept as defined by Pr˘evost et al. (2014) -, thus translating his 
attachment to both the soil and the place (Oasis Citadine). The general 
public, manufacturers, scientists, and farmers are frequently criticized 
for not taking care of the soil and for participating in its pollution by 
overdosing fertilizers in a short-term aim: 
“I am in opposition to what is currently being done in intensive 
monoculture where the soil can be seen to be turning into dust, 
completely dry and destroyed. So it’s more in opposition to these 
practices that I am trying to learn more about a fertile soil, so I can 
reproduce it” (gardener, 40 years old, project manager). 
They describe the soil in a fairly homogeneous manner, consistent 
with the approach of the Oasis citadine founders, namely as a habitat, “a

possible collapse of our civilization and in its consequences. It is linked to the 
idea that man alters his environment in an ecological emergency, in particular 
in connection with global warming. In France, collapsology has been brought to 
the attention of the general public, notably by Pablo Servigne and Rapha el 
Stevens (2015) . P. Scheromm and A. Javelle

4mixture of ore and organic matte ”, hosting a wide diversity of micro- 
organisms (bacteria, fungi, worms, etc.). 
“The definition of a soil would start with having earthworms, having 
bugs of all kinds, spiders ” (gardener, 31 years old, craftsman) 
The soil is called by some gardeners a “living organism ”, which gives 
it a kind of specific organic identity. It is never referred to as a support or 
resource. Gardeners ’ remarks refer to representations of the soil as a 
living environment, a habitat, more than as an organized whole, except 
for two members with more extensive gardening experience acquired in 
other places. These experienced gardeners have more precise knowledge 
of soil composition and layered organization, and refer to “successive 
strata, matter horizons, soil fauna ”. The soil life mentioned is limited, for 
most of the gardeners, to earthworms, considered the real “chefs5” of the 
soil (an expression that comes from the trainers) which produce the 
argilo-humic complex and the humus, guarantors of a soil of good 
quality: 
“The mound is a feast, it’s the Roman Bacchanalia for earthworms ” 
(gardener, 40 years old, project manager) 
Few gardeners cite other soil-dwelling species, which are very often 
generically referred to as “little animals ” or “bugs ”. But even if the 
gardeners ’ naturalistic knowledge of the soil biodiversity seems to be 
limited to some species and if their comments are often not very 
detailed, they always identify the soil as something living, not inert. 
Soil fertility is also considered from the angle of the life it harbors: 
“A fertile soil means that there is life in it, it’s the biodiversity, the 
life in the soil that determines fertility, and thanks to fertility there 
are plants ” (gardener, 30 years old, head cook) 
Several gardeners mention that fertility is above all a natural feature 
of the soil. Fertility is thought of as an original property, with recurring 
references to the lands of the Nile and the soils of primary forests. For 
most of the gardeners, human presence, especially in recent decades, has 
diminished this fertility: 
“Before there were humans, the soil was doing just fine, there were 
primary forests ” (gardener, 30 years old, head cook). “I think a soil is originally naturally fertile, then we made it infertile, 
we can re-make it fertile, we can increase its fertility […] it was 
because it was fertile that life was able to develop, humans arrived 
much later ” (gardener, 47 years old, social worker) 
Humans are often related to predators, so much so that some gar-
deners ’ words express the desire to blend into a perfect nature and not to 
intervene through actions considered as too destructive. The natural 
processes of the soil are idealized, sublimated, and artificiality and 
anthropization of soils are negatively perceived. 
“The soil works well alone, it does not need us” (gardener, 30 years 
old, head cook) 
“What would really be best, definitely, is to leave the forests as they 
are or not to destroy them, or to succeed in setting up a system where 
we could pick without having to plant “ (gardener, 40 years old, 
project manager) 
In extreme cases, some gardeners personify the soil: 
“The soil is earth, and the earth knows what it’s doing, what it needs 
to do to ensure a balance ” (gardener, 30 years old, translator) 
“The earth is intelligent, so what grows is automatically in the right 
place ” (gardener, 28 years old, green spaces maintenance worker). 
The gardeners and the leaders agree that any plants removed from 
the garden must never be described as weeds, consistent with the idea 
that the soil (and nature) does not produce anything useless. 
The gardeners are however aware that some interventions are 
necessary. They report that it is necessary to supplement the soil with 
manure, ramial chipped wood, or compost to attract worms and make it 
lighter. But they insist on the fact that green manure for example has to 
be added sparingly, that the soil is naturally balanced and that too much 
of anything from outside can lead to saturation. They consider that they 
must intervene as little as possible and rely primarily on the autonomous 
functioning of the ecosystem. Interventions have to draw on observation 
of natural processes and on their imitation: 
“You observe nature, always reproduce or follow what nature does 
[…], you allow nature and the plants their freedom to some extent, 
don’t force them too much, observe, let them do their thing and have 
more confidence in them than in yourselves ” (gardener, 30 years old, 
translator)

5The founders show them practices that respect this idea, like creating 
mounds 6 that have their lives with as little interventions as it is possible, 
or mulching to imitate forest covers. Some gardeners question the status 
of the land they have helped to build: 
“It’s a mound soil, yes. But it’s not natural soil, well it’s not soil… yes 
it’s natural soil which has been built in a natural way, hmmm, how 
can I put it… Aaah, it’s complicated ” (gardener, 47 years old, social 
worker) 
The reference to the respect of natural processes is permanent, and 
guarantees the sustainability of soil fertility. Human action must only 
accompany the natural processes at work in the soil, as described by a 
gardener speaking of a permaculture mound: 
“Let’s say that for once, human action is restorative and non- 
destructive […] if we set up a mound there we’ll just contribute to 
the development of soil fertility, but in a natural way” (gardener, 47 
years old, social worker) 
This gardener seeks to understand the processes at work with a view 
to engaging in an interrelationship with the soil, not taking arbitrary 
action on a nature-object: 
“It is important that we interact but in a good way, or at least with 
benevolence, without an attitude of ‘me first, after me chaos, I don’t 
care’. No, no, no, it is in a spirit of benevolence for the other or-
ganisms that exist on this earth ”. 
The gardeners want to " cherish " and " care for " the soil, in such a 
way as: 
“to make it possible to cut out the use of pesticides, to cut out any-
thing that depletes the soil, anything that causes erosion, anything 
that causes the death of our soils, to oppose destruction as far as 
possible, whether it’s from monoculture or concreting over ”. 
Comments of some gardeners, in particular the more experienced, 
show that their senses (sight, touch and smell) are mobilized in their 
approach of the soil, and that it is essential to take care of the soil 
properly. 
“Last time I dug holes, there, to plant tomatoes, and I see lots of 
golden cetacean larvae. […] the golden cetacean helps to degrade 
organic matter, and once the larva becomes an adult, it’s a polli-
nating insect so they ’re very good larvae ” (gardener, 28 years old, 
farm worker). 
Concerning the smell, the gardeners repeatedly refer to the smell of 
decomposing matter, a smell akin to the smell of forests ’ soils: 
“If it smells like forest, it’s a good sign” (gardener, 30 years old, head 
cook). 
These descriptions of the soil calling upon the mobilization of the 
senses are part of a sensitive relationship with the soil and linked to the 
desire and the will to take care of it. 
4.Discussion 
Oasis citadine farm is a place where members like to gather to enjoy a 
natural environment and experiment with agroecologicall practices 
within the framework of shared values. In this sense, the gardeners form 
a community of agricultural practice, learning, thinking and having 
their own identity (Wenger, 1998 ). The interviews seeking to explore their representations of the soil generally rely on an ethical and spiritual 
approach of nature preservation and on environmental concerns. Cen-
tral to these representations is the notion of life and respect of this life. 
The gardeners see the soil as a habitat for life, almost independently of 
what it produces. The notion of yield appears very secondary, which is 
often the case in shared gardens (Scheromm, 2015; Martin et al., 2017 ), 
as if producing was not the main objective. Their concerns are mostly 
about the intrinsic value of soil life and echo recent scientific works 
stating that it is "no longer understood as abiotic and static", and "has 
become a dense web intermeshing elements and organisms" (Granjou, 
2019 ). Being aware of the vital importance of the soils, the gardeners see 
them as “living worlds ” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019 ) that it is time to stop 
destroying and exploiting. The natural processes at work, even if they 
are not clearly described, are considered as a model, associated with soil 
inherent fertility. 
Soil, and nature in a general way, are often idealized, taken into 
consideration for their perfection, and set in opposition to humans ’ ac-
tions that are considered as responsible for the devastation of non- 
renewable resources of the soils. Comments show indeed that some 
gardeners are drawing on a moral dimension based on the assertion that 
all that is natural is good (Beau, 2017 ), thus relaying the perpetuation of 
the myth of an ideal world where humans evolved in a wild, virgin, and 
immaculate nature, an outdated image widely deconstructed by a 
number of authors (Denevan, 2012; Descola, 2005 ). Adhering to this 
moral dimension, these gardeners tend to lose sight that humans must 
produce an abondunt food to survive. 
If the soil is sometimes perceived as part of an idealized nature, the 
gardeners however develop in parallel the idea that it requires human 
intervention: it needs to be repaired, on the condition of respecting its 
natural content and functioning. The artificial appears acceptable when 
it imitates the natural, raised to normative status. In this way, the gar-
deners are in line with the principles of agroecology by establishing 
natural functions as models for the construction of agroecosystems that 
respect biological processes and their complexity (Mal˘ezieux, 2012 ). 
In imitating nature, human action can be meaningful. Although 
comments sometimes sound contradictory (attraction of an absolute 
laisser-faire approach toether with needs of interventions), the gar-
deners express the idea of working in synergy with the soil. They 
enounciate relationships rehabilitating human action, considering " 
interdependent conceptions of human-soil relations [that] could chal-
lenge the unidirectional linearity and anthropocentrism of productionist 
and service approaches. " (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). Thus, the rela-
tionship between gardeners and the soil appears relatively symmetrical, 
not a relationship of domination theorized by a number of authors 
(Latour, 1997; Panelli, 2010; Ingold, 2013; Berque, 2014 ). Acting in the 
most natural way possible, while respecting the soil’s life and its pro-
cesses, is the principle behind the gardeners ’ intervention. The humility 
and modesty of this human attitude paves the way for a dialogical 
relationship, in opposition to the dualistic view of the human-nature 
relationships. They develop a thinking based on the "co-production of 
a more-than-human world [.] which excludes any strict separation be-
tween the domains of the social and the natural" (Meulemans and 
Granjou, 2020 ). This can lead them to question what nature is. 
This dialogical relationship is reinforced by the will of the gardeners 
to provide care for the soil. The care-inspired ethic strongly permeates 
the representations of gardeners, in relation to their practice of perma -
culture which puts the care at the heart of its conception. Seen in this 
way, the relationships leave room to feel responsibility while repairing 
the damage caused. The importance of the environmental care has 
already been noted in some papers related to urban gardening in col-
lective gardens (Pitt, 2018; Alarcon and Hochedez, 2018 ) and for 
alternative farming practices (Krzywoszynska, 2019; Foyer et al., 2020; 
Mincyt le et al., 2020 ). Environmental care proposes a new quality of 
relationship with the elements of nature based on attention and pro-
tection. It posits seeing humans ’ relationship with ordinary, everyday 
nature in a way that goes beyond the traditional opposition between 6 The permaculture mound is an experimental technique requiring no tillage 
and favoring ecosystem processes, which makes it an object that can be 
described as natural. Nevertheless, the soil has to be extensively remodeled to 
build mounds and this must be carried out with great care (Javelle, 2020 ). P. Scheromm and A. Javelle

6natural and artificial, changing how we view our relations with 
non-humans (Laugier, 2012 ). Care generally makes relationships and 
their entanglements central, with the bodily solicitations and physical 
contact they involve and opens the way for emotions to build “a different 
moral voice ” (Gilligan et al., 2010 ). “Denouncing the illusion of pure and 
perfect reason, care leaves room for perceptions, for affects, for sensi-
tivity ” (Petit, 2014 ). Reflected in the gardeners ’ words is an affective 
relationship with the soil that engages the gardeners in practices 
respectful of soil life and makes them pay attention to bioogical pro-
cesses that take place in the soil. The gardeners ’ relationship with the 
soil is not viewed in utilitarian and instrumental terms, but rather in 
terms of mentoring and sollicitude, where the human takes a “compas -
sionate assistant ” stance (Pineau, 2019 ). Seen in this way, the rela-
tionship is consistent with a feeling of responsibility for the damages 
caused. Insofar as the gardeners consider the soil as living, nourish it, 
give it back the matter they have taken from it, they become “soil 
farmers instead of soil consumers ” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 ). 
They are aware of the need to respond appropriately to a soil that is 
vulnerable. However, two considerations must be taken into account 
here. On the one hand, taking care of the soil and providing what it 
needs requires the care-giver to " take a certain degree of responsibility 
for an identified need and to determine the means required to meet it " 
(Tronto, 2008 ). On the other hand, where produce is involved, fertility is 
directly linked to the soil’s ability to produce plant biomass; fertility is a 
socio-technical construct, the result of interaction between man and the 
soil, whose maintenance requires appropriate management via specific 
techniques and practices (Gasselin, . et al., 2010 ). As a number of gar-
deners rely heavily on the advice of the project leaders and do not 
immerse themselves much in the practice, they do not fully realize the 
degree of responsibility they bear for setting up this interaction. Nor do 
they fully understand the kind of care that is required; the " gardeners ’ 
care " is actually directed towards a soil that they know little about and 
idealize. Having only recently joined the newly-created Oasis citadine 
farm, they lack the specific agronomic knowledge recognized as essen -
tial to a productive agroecological approach (Cristofari, 2018; Tour-
donnet and Brives, 2018 ), showing the importance of a regular 
confrontation with the soil and of assiduity in practice. A strong physical 
relationship with the soil is indeed necessary to reconcile humans with it 
(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2019 ). 
Moreover, we have observed some tensions and contradictions in 
gardener ’s statements. These are characteristic of new representations 
are representations under construction. The gardeners have indeed told 
us that their perceptions have changed since they started visiting the 
Oasis citadine. The distance between gardeners and soil could be 
reduced thanks to time spent gardening, when the gardeners become 
more physically and intellectually accustomed to soil cultivating. The 
construction of new representations is a long and complex process; long 
term involvement in urban gardening practices should allow the would- 
be gardeners to go beyong the process of idealization that we have 
observed, establishing an even more dialogical relationship with the 
soil. 
5.Conclusion 
The disproportionate exploitation of soil is linked to the relations of 
domination that have developed between humans and non-humans in 
an urbanized world. This domination has resulted in massive use of 
chemicals and farming techniques such as deep ploughing, altering soil 
life while forgetting that this life determines soil quality. City dwellers 
have been unaware of these degradation since their daily lives offer 
them very little contact with the soil. Today, collective urban gardens 
and collaborative urban farms are attractive to city dwellers for many 
reasons, including their need for nature and social ties. Frequenting 
them allow to discover the soil and its functioning, to think about what is 
a soil. Although long-term follow-ups are required to confirm these first 
data, our results show that gardening modifies soil’s representations of city dwellers. They suggest that the places where it is practiced could 
participate in building an ethic, both individual and collective, of the 
citizen ’s relationships with the soil. Frequenting such places initiates 
them to a dialogical relationship with soil. They are taught the living 
dimension of the soil and enter in a sensitive, affective, and caring 
relationship with it. New soil’s representations are set up, that promote 
it from a support status to a living and dynamic status. The multiplica -
tion of gardening experiments in cities, that attract wider and wider 
audiences of practitioners, will allow city dwellers to participate to the 
project of thinking with soils (Salazar et al., 2020 ). 
It would also be important to broaden the issue within the framework 
of an environmental care geography : how can the quality of the relation -
ships established with the soil be extended outside the garden, so as to 
involve other inhabitants in this approach? The reconfiguration of citi-
zens ’ relationship with soil (and elements of nature in a more general 
way) is fundamental for the construction of a sustainable city. Future 
research could usefully explore these essential reconfigurations with a 
view to promoting new approaches to urban planning based on new 
relationships with soil and nature.
