This paper explores learning about environments 
with a focus on starting with trees. The paper exam -
ines children and young people's perceptions of and 
engagement with trees, as part of a large grant that 
sought to examine the dis/benefits of trees for chil -
dren's lives and learning. In this paper, we attempt to 
move beyond notions of ‘education for sustainabil -
ity’ in that we start with knowledges generated with  
trees. We are concerned that current educational 
discourses tend to incorporate extractivist perspec -
tives. They also focus on humans rather than the 
inseparability of the natural world from the human 
experience as a starting point for research. The 
paper is based on a large-  scale, transdisciplinary, 
UK- based project, rooted in in-  depth, co-  produced 
research with a total of 545 children and young peo -
ple, across multiple primary and secondary schools 
in England and Scotland. The paper begins and 
exemplifies a new conversation about what start -
ing with trees might enable for studies of education 
and childhood. We propose the concepts of dwell -
ing, skilling and belonging as a novel framework for 
‘starting with trees’.

STARTING WITH TREES
INTRODUCTION
In this paper we ask what it might mean for us—academics, educators, learners—to ‘start 
with trees’ in co-  producing environmental knowledges. On the one hand, to start with 
trees is to offer a constructive critique of other possible starting points when it comes to 
environmental learning. To start with trees might be to (attempt to) move between and beyond 
notions of ‘education for sustainability’ that have often become entangled in problematic 
ways with neoliberal understandings of sustainability and economic development (Cachelin 
et al., 2015 ). To start with trees might also be to avoid the ways in which certain aspects of 
environmental change—like climate change, plastic pollution and desertification—come to 
dominate both popular discourses and concerns about the environment, and educational 
curricula, in part because of anthropocentric bias (Kopnina, 2014 ).
On the other hand, to start with trees is—in our conception—an attempt at a more open, 
inclusive, entangled, networked, complexified, less clearly defined way of working, play -
ing and experimenting with environmental knowledges. To start with trees does not, for 
instance, mean to start with deforestation; it does not, of necessity, mean taking children 
into ‘pristine’ forested environments with some determinist views of the healing benefits of 
nature in mind (cf. Louv, 2005 ); it does not have to be tied to the ways in which trees could 
sequester carbon (if only we could plant more of them); it does not mean simply looking at 
this tree and measuring its height. It could  mean any or all of these things, but it could mean 
much else besides. And if we attend to what else  (Horton & Kraftl, 2006 ) starting with trees 
might enable, in open arrangements that attend to the uncertainty of the happenstance 
(Badwan et al., 2024 ), it might be possible to think and work with diverse, exciting, genera -
tive possibilities: potentially new, heterogeneous, even disruptive ways of relating with trees 
emotionally, bodily, affectively, artistically, scientifically (etc.)—whatever those terms might 
mean in context (e.g., see Nxumalo et al., 2022 ). Such terms can take us into areas that 
stretch beyond neat understandings into spaces of not knowing that require attention as a 
mode of creative inquiry (Badwan et al., 2024 ).
What if we start by simply drawing a tree (any tree)? Or start by modelling the roots of 
trees with pipe cleaners? Or start by telling stories about what might happen to a particular 
tree in the future? What if we start with movements of children and technologies as they Key insights
What is the main issue that the paper addresses?
The paper addresses the limited focus in current approaches to ‘education for 
sustainability’ and is concerned with what they might leave out. It develops an 
understanding of climate change education, with a focus on trees and children and 
young people's relationships and entanglements with them.
What are the main insights that the paper provides?
Drawing on the experiences of children and young people, we argue that it is important 
to work with the concept of diversity, both with children and young people as part 
of methodological attuning to trees and children assemblages. Our key message 
is the importance of starting with trees as a mode of working within the field of 
environmental education, focusing conceptually on dwelling, skilling and belonging.

attempt to measure trees through a whole range of techniques—some ‘accepted’ by tree 
scientists, others not? Or by starting conversations about the soil in which trees grow?
Indeed, in thinking through all of the above questions, it might not matter too much if 
we start with trees; grasses, shrubs, rocks, plastics might all be equally interesting and 
provocative. However, trees are a good place to start in thinking and doing between and 
beyond environmental education: they are a key locus—symbol, even—of attempts to deal 
with climate change through carbon sequestration; and trees hold a special place in human 
cultures, replete with myths, imageries, meanings and the sense of rootedness-  in- place 
they afford us. Therefore, this paper charts just some ways in which, in our work with teach -
ers and children in schools in the United Kingdom, we have experimented in ‘starting with 
trees’—and what the implications for curriculum, learning and teaching about the environ -
ment might be if we take such starting points seriously.
In order to grapple with the questions outlined above—and in order to outline an agenda 
for what it might mean to start with trees in environmental education —this paper progresses 
through three ‘traces’ of research materials from the Voices of the Future project. Voices of 
the Future was a large, UK-  based, 40-  month, transdisciplinary research project involving a 
core team of 23 academics representing disciplines including childhood studies, education, 
applied linguistics, human and physical geography, ecology, youth studies, sociology, art 
practice, anthropology, landscape architecture, English and philosophy.
Driven by a commitment to co-  production, the wider team included partners from major, 
regional tree-  planting agencies such as The Mersey Forest and Manchester City of Trees, 
educators from a wide range of settings, youth workers, and children and young people 
themselves. Across our various sites, we worked in-  depth with a total of 545 children and 
young people, aged from 2 to 25. In the north west we worked with 12 families and 21 very 
young children, 330 primary and 30 secondary school children, and 61 young people. In 
Aberdeen we worked with 103 primary school children.
Although forming part of a larger UK research programme ('The Future of UK Treescapes') 
aiming to improve UK treescapes (environments with trees) for the benefit of the environ -
ment and society, principally through mobilising the capacity of trees to absorb carbon, this 
project took a rather different approach. Through a series of work packages and sub-  work 
packages, across sites in northwestern England, South Yorkshire and Aberdeenshire, it 
sought to understand and co-  produce with  children knowledge about trees. Central to our 
work, grounded in philosophies of hope, the project aimed to co-  construct with children a 
range of plans, actions and (speculative) stories to address the (possible) future of trees and 
treescapes where they live.
Across these aims, we sought to attend to the diversity  of children and young people's 
learning, knowledges, experiences and hopes for trees. On the one hand, this meant that we 
worked in depth (in most cases for a year or more) with large groups of children (up to 90) 
at each site, ensuring that we worked with a very diverse range of spaces and communities. 
These sites included: early years settings in South Yorkshire; a highly ethnically diverse 
primary school in central Manchester; a predominantly white, working class primary school 
in Bolton; children between the ages of 6 and 12 in an ethnically diverse city primary school 
in an area of high deprivation and a middle-  income suburban primary school on the edge of 
Aberdeen; several secondary schools and colleges in the Greater Manchester region; and 
a group of around 20 recently arrived asylum-  seeking young people via a youth group in 
Manchester.
On the other hand, we developed, with our partners, a range of transdisciplinary method -
ologies that could enable us to start with trees. Some of the richness of these approaches 
is articulated via small, ephemeral ‘traces’ of practice that, in our words, ‘start with trees’ 
later in the paper. However, in broader terms, as noted above, this often meant spending a 
year or more at each site, carefully co-  developing appropriate methods with children, young

STARTING WITH TREES
people and their associated adults. Often, researchers from multiple disciplines participated 
in research sessions at the same time, as we: explored with and trained children and young 
people how to do research with trees from different disciplinary perspectives; introduced 
‘scientific’, ‘social-  scientific’ and ‘arts and humanities’ approaches to working with trees; en -
gaged children in a range of creative activities—from designing treescapes to writing stories 
about trees in the future; engaged children in planning, planting, caring and maintaining for 
trees, often in their school grounds or places proximate to where they lived; experimented 
with a range of lower-  and higher-  tech equipment (from laser scanners to iPads, and from 
notebooks to rulers) to derive manifold ways to ‘measure’—or get the measure—of trees 
(Pahl et al., forthcoming ); and attended, all the while, to the stories, memories, experiences, 
emotions and embodied interactions children and young people engaged in with trees—
whether verbal or non- verbal. It is this assemblage of our attentions that offers glimpses into 
children's and our own experiences of learning with trees. As historical geographer Sarah 
Mills notes: ‘it is the fragments that contain the beauty, mystery and particular way of reading 
the archive that so enchants them’ (Mills, 2013 : 704).
DWELLING, SKILLING AND BELONGING
We combine this approach of starting with trees with a focus on ideas of ‘dwelling, skilling 
and belonging’ as ways of developing a shared understanding of—and potentially powerful 
framework for—the mechanisms needed to start with trees. The idea of dwelling is drawn 
initially from Ingold's notion of the ‘dwelling perspective’, first introduced in The perception of 
the environment  (Ingold,  2000 ), which troubled a housebound understanding of what it is to 
dwell, and was the starting point for rethinking the place of people in the world and the rela -
tionships between humans and non-  humans in the world. Reflecting back on this idea some -
time later in Being alive: Essays on movement, knowledge and description , Ingold ( 2011) 
reiterates the way in which a ‘dwelling perspective’ opens up the notion that humans ‘inhabit’ 
(p. 71) rather than occupy the world, working ‘with materials, … rather than just doing to 
them’ (p. 10). Distancing himself from Heidegger's idea of dwelling, which separates humans 
from other animals, Ingold makes clear that a ‘dwelling perspective’ draws instead on the 
role of movement in the eco-  psychological approaches to perception of Gibson ( 1979 , cited 
in Ingold, 2013 : 11) and Merleau-  Ponty's phenomenological approach to perception in which 
humans are ‘stitched into the fabric of the world’ (p. 12). In this reflection, Ingold reconfigures 
the ideas of the dwelling perspective from being cosily placebound to situate the dwelling 
perspective within the expansive movements of everyday life and activity of humans and 
non- humans in the world, putting an emphasis on ‘wayfaring’ (p. 12). A dwelling perspective 
in which humans and non-  humans live and move ‘skilfully in and through their surroundings’ 
(p. 10) implies that in so doing, people are shaped as much by what they live amongst as 
by people.
In the context of exploring how children and young people—along with adults—in schools 
encounter, make sense of and learn from/with/about trees, both the notions of the dwell -
ing perspective and wayfaring, underpinned by the development of the skills to ‘live and in 
through their surroundings’ (Ingold,  2013 ) are pertinent to our work. Skills in this sense are 
multifaceted and do not follow meritocratic hierarchies, drawing from Bernstein's example 
of a skilled blacksmith, who despite creating a different arc of the hammer on each blow, 
always hits the spot because they have the skill to tune their movement (Bernstein 1967 , 
cited in Ingold, 2013 : 58). This then provides a very different framing for education, one that 
emphasises what children know and what they can do.
In contrast to current global educational policies that focus attention on attainment (e.g., 
PISA, which fosters a competitive and often reductive perspective on learning), Ingold's 
 14693518, 2025, 2, Downloaded from https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/berj.4099 by Capes, Wiley Online Library on [18/09/2025].

writing suggests a slow and deep development of experience, skills and knowledge, which 
come into being through encounters between humans and non-  humans of different ages 
and dispositions, through practice and repetition. His ideas echo Alison Clark's call for slow 
pedagogies (Clark, 2022 ), which, although stemming from working in an early years context, 
is relevant to people of all ages. Our work with children, young people and trees has allowed 
everyone to slow down and make time to be curious, to question, to listen, to learn together 
and reciprocally between children, trees and adults. Our approach has made it possible to 
recognise when being still or moving about heightens our perceptions of being in a treed 
world. It also calls into question how open schools are to breaking down the dualism between 
‘vocational skills’ and curricular knowledges. We mean this in two inter-  related ways: on the 
one hand, in terms of the ways in which children and young people (especially) found ways 
to dwell (or not), feel comfortable (or not), settle (or not)—even if momentarily—through the 
course of our co-  production activities; on the other hand, in terms of the ways in which these 
forms of dwelling recursively dwelled, sat or fit within (or not) the spaces, rhythms, knowl -
edges and practices of the schools we worked with, and their curricula.
Building on the above discussion, in terms of skilling , we argue later in the paper that 
we were struck by forms of doing and knowing that are either rarely valorised in, or actively 
excluded from, school curricula. We use the term ‘skills’ deliberately and provocatively since 
(in the United Kingdom) there are increasing concerns about a shortage of skills for the 
forestry sector and—increasingly—about the lack of diversity within the forestry workforce 
(particularly in terms of gender and ethnicity). Whilst our project does not seek to address 
this ‘skills gap’, the notion of skilling more broadly understood is helpful in extending debates 
about environmental learning beyond those covered by the literatures above (where ques -
tions of ‘skills’ are rarely broached). We want, for instance, to explore and amplify instances 
of where ‘traditional’ or ‘working class’ skills (and knowledges) about working with trees, 
treescapes and wood—which are often fairly localised but also often effaced in contempo -
rary school curricula—are being and might be a part of school-  based learning about trees -
capes. In an interview with a forest educator (conducted by the team in March 2023), the 
educator described how rare the skills are that are connected to woodlands, and he argued 
that these need to be more visible within schools. The educator, who was himself a forestor, 
talked about the skill of coppicing. He said that the children
… just come up here, learn some stuff, build some stuff, have a good time and 
enjoy with your friends and it links with those children who don't have that con -
tact with nature, like when we coppice this hedge, I need it a lot more … that's 
why we do other coppicing going because they may not know how to live with 
nature and keep it alive . 
(Interview, 14 March 2023)
We are concerned about the ways in which ‘tree skills’ are positioned within the sec -
tor and wonder how they might open out opportunities for learning that may resonate well 
with some learners—that may enable them to dwell more comfortably with trees and tree- 
knowledges—than do other forms of environmental education. We also want to avoid ro -
manticising those forms of knowledge and skills (who and what might ‘traditional’ ways of 
working with and knowing land exclude?), and evade any sense of a dualism between ‘voca -
tional’ skills and curricula knowledges. In other words, we want to ask how a move to consid -
ering skill-  ing—understood as, but also beyond, ‘traditional’ forestry skills—can challenge, 
augment, supplement or otherwise develop environmental education in school curricula?
The concepts of longing and belonging (articulated as ‘ (be)longing ’) weave time, place, 
humans and non-  humans together to provide unexpected diffractive configurations. The 
project's emphasis on the future is anchored in learning to attend to children's past memories,

STARTING WITH TREES
experiences and histories, as well as their present being, becoming and ongoingness in the 
world (Horton & Kraftl, 2006 ). This connection between the past, the present and the future 
stretches life like a story in an act of ‘longing’ (Ingold, 2018 : 21). However, we use longing in 
a slightly different way here. Unlike Ingold's focus on stretching life ‘along a line’, we break 
free from lines as they risk keeping us in the epistemological pursuit of coherence and con -
vergence (Deleuze & Guattari, 1983 ). The longing we embrace is stretching in regular and 
irregular shapes, following the rhythm of children's entanglements in this research assem -
blage. It is a tool to tie together and yet branch out. It is also a space to assemble and scatter 
voices and worlds (Ambreen et al., 2023 ; Ambreen et al., forthcoming ). We recognise this in 
the way we write about children's encounters with trees.
In the next part of the paper, we briefly position our work and its contributions in respect 
of the large and complex field of environmental education. Thereafter, we recount in detail a 
series of experiential traces of practice from across our research sites in order to draw out 
a range of key questions and considerations for starting with trees, between and beyond 
environmental education.
We draw on the idea from Said ( 1981 ) of ‘traces’ of practice, snippets recorded in the 
field and then written down in an experimental way (see also Mills, 2013 ). Said's original 
account was situated in the context of recovering a history that has been subjugated. Here, 
we use the term ‘traces’ to describe the echoes from the field that we experienced. Written 
by different combinations of authors, they are deliberately multiply voiced and mediated, as 
we experiment with different written and presentational styles that we argue are necessary 
for witnessing the outcomes of our approach, outlined above (on the need for such styles 
in socio-  environmental research with children and young people, see also ; Kraftl, 2020 ). 
This led to a more diffuse and open conceptual framework for the idea of starting with trees. 
Throughout, and in conclusion, we outline the broader implications of our work for (environ -
mental) education scholars.
LOOKING BETWEEN AND BEYOND 
ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
There are many established fields of scholarship that critically evaluate environmental 
education as broadly understood (for detailed reviews, see Monroe et al., 2019 ; Rousell 
& Cutter-  Mackenzie-  Knowles,  2020 ). There has been a proliferation of research about 
environmental education, education for sustainability (and sustainable development), 
outdoor learning, experiential learning, alternative education and Forest School. In relation to 
sustainability, environmental and climate change education, the common terms used in the 
UK Department for Education strategy (Department for Education, 2022 ) over-  emphasise 
economic values and less attention is paid to social and relational dimensional aspects, 
requiring a collaborative partnership among policymakers, teachers, educators, young 
people and children (Dunlop & Rushton, 2022 ). The focus on environmental learning has 
tended to focus on the potential for human-  oriented learning and the benefits to humans. 
For example, environmental education has been described by the American Association for 
Environmental Education, and quoted on their UK site, as being
… a key tool in expanding the constituency for the environmental movement and 
creating healthier and more civically engaged communities. ( https://  naee.  org. 
uk/ so-  what-   is-  envir onmen  tal-  educa  tion/ )
This work has been accompanied by burgeoning theoretical perspectives, many of which 
have sought to challenge the notion that learning about environments and environmental

KRAFTL  et al .
change should be based on the didactic transfer of knowledge to learners in traditional 
classroom settings (Trott & Weinberg, 2020 ). Many, indeed, focused on children and young 
people as agents of change (e.g., see Mackey, 2012 ). In part, this involves decentring ‘teach -
ers’ as providers of stable environmental knowledges, towards more discursive, participa -
tory, inclusive, interdisciplinary and creative approaches to environmental education (BERA 
Research Commission,  2021 ). In part, though, this means moving beyond the classroom, 
as outdoor learning and Forest School settings privilege forms of learning through active 
‘connectedness’ with specific (‘natural’) places, such as local woodlands—often involving 
activities like walking, playing, climbing, collecting and making in the generation of ‘place- 
responsive pedagogies’ (Kraftl, 2013 ; Lynch & Mannion, 2021 ).
Meanwhile, Common Worlds conceptualisations of environmental learning seek to 
question the very foundations of what it means to be a human (and a ‘learner’) within envi -
ronments (Taylor & Pacini-  Ketchabaw, 2018). Where Forest School might still view (child) 
learners as individuated human subjects, Common Worlds framings deploy feminist new 
materialist and posthumanist theories to position children as porous, emerging only ever 
in relation with  the world (e.g., see Crinall & Someverville, 2020 ). Although still profoundly 
place-  based and place-  aware, Common Worlds theorists and pedagogues are thus more 
interested in how children interact, are entangled and become-  with the more-  than-  human 
flora, fauna and flows with which they have contact (Land et al., 2022 ). As the Common 
Worlds Research Collective ( 2020 : 2) argues in a recent paper for the UNESCO Futures 
of education  report, ‘this requires a complete paradigm shift [for environmental educa -
tion]: from learning about the world in order to act upon it, to learning to become with the 
world around us’.
Whilst overlapping to some extent, each of the above approaches offers a different frame -
work for understanding the relationship between learners, learning and environments (and 
particularly environmental change). Moreover, to differing extents, each offers a critique of 
contemporary approaches to environmental education as it is set within the disciplinary, 
regulatory and political traditions of education systems in countries like the United Kingdom 
(Howard-  Jones et al., 2021 ). As indicated above, a key outcome of this critique is that in -
creasingly popular forms of environmental learning now take place ‘outside’ the classroom, 
if not the curriculum itself (Jickling et al., 2018). Yet, in this paper, we want to think again, and 
to think further, about what it means to engage in diverse forms of learning, doing, feeling 
and knowing (about) trees . For our work, these diverse literatures prompt three consider -
ations, questions and provocations—about dwelling , skilling  and (be)longing .
In terms of dwelling , we demonstrate later in the paper how different disciplinary curric -
ula (especially science) cannot (fully) accommodate our co-  production work in the Voices 
of the Future project. It was hard to find spaces and times in which our work could settle 
or sit comfortably within or alongside the curriculum in schools, especially when different 
schools have different interpretations of following and enriching the statutory curriculum, 
and it is even harder to imagine how it might be incorporated in a formal sense into future 
curricular developments. Part of the reason for this was that we wanted to consider more 
deeply what it was like to (be)long , with treescapes, in diverse forms and styles. Critically, 
this did not mean privileging certain ways of being (and acting, and skilling ) within carefully 
chosen (‘pristine’) treescapes in order to afford socio-  culturally narrow forms of nature (re)
connection (Kraftl et al., 2019 ). Rather, it meant proliferating ways of dwelling with/in , skill-
ing with/in and (be)longing with/in treescapes with diverse ages and groups of children, in 
diverse kinds of treescapes and in places that might not (yet) be considered as treescapes 
(school classrooms, playgrounds, urban streets). In this paper, then, we seek to extend 
beyond notions of nature connectedness, place responsiveness and doing/being-  with, in 
order to explore what the concepts of dwelling , skilling  and (be)longing might afford envi -
ronmental education.

STARTING WITH TREES
In the remainder of the paper, we introduce experimentally written traces of prac -
tice from our sites, which draw together and extend our discussion of dwelling , skilling  
and (be)longing , above. Our approach is to allow—to some extent—the case studies to 
‘breathe’, attending to the multiple rhythms, mediations and performances that emerged 
when starting with trees. In the paper's conclusion, we draw out the implications of the 
case studies.
LEARNING HOW TO BE IN THE WORLD: TREE AS TEACHER
Here we draw on observations and films co-  created by children in a small patch of wood -
land adjacent to a primary school playing field in Bolton. We hone in on a semi-  rural 
school, which was located adjacent to a town in the north west of England. We developed, 
with the children, a project called Trees and Us, which was concerned with trees. In part -
nership with Manchester City of Trees, a tree-  planting charity, and with the support of the 
Year 3 and 4 teachers in the school (children aged 7–8, n  = 90), we worked intensively 
in the school to support a tree-  planting and tree-  exploring project. Alongside tree plant -
ing, we worked with a trained Forest School teacher, who encouraged the children to 
encounter trees through free play in a series of Forest School sessions within the school 
day. We documented these sessions, developing an understanding of a relational sense 
of (be)longing, which was both multilingual and sensory, experienced through action and 
experience. This sense of (be)longing was actively constructed through interaction with 
the woodlands.
The writing below was created as a response to spending several afternoons with chil -
dren and a forest educator in the space. At times it was chilly, and we found it difficult to 
concentrate because of the cold. The children's responses to the woodlands constituted a 
commentary on how the woods could become methodologies for learning.
Children roamed freely in the school woodland. Moving away from didactic modes of 
learning within the concrete walls of the classroom, children learned through a process 
of self-  discovery (Ingold,  2013 ). During the process, trees, children and other human and 
more-  than-  human materials and bodies became part of the process of learning about/with 
nature. Children were not told by their Forest School teacher, Richard (pseudonym), what to 
do. Instead, the focus was very much on how to experience things. This enabled curiosity 
among the children about ‘what to look for’, in the Forest School teacher's words, by watch -
ing, listening, feeling and paying attention to human and more-  than-  human materials and 
bodies.
You get to climb trees and if you fall over, you don't hurt as much . (Richard, 
forest practitioner)
It is fun to take leaves off the ground and make things out of them so it's really 
fun. (child)
In this exploration we learned from the children what movement feels like around 
trees. Using Tim Ingold's Being alive: Essays on movement, knowledge and description 
(Ingold,  2011), we explored how movement was reconfigured through the branches and 
bark of a tree. The children touched the trees, ‘we touch with our hands as well as our feet’ 
(Ingold,  2011: 45) and the surface of the tree afforded the climb. While we tend to imagine 
that things are perceived from a stationary platform, when watching a child climb a tree, 
we ask: How does the feel of a surface differ? How is perception different from the point of 
climbing a tree? If ‘Movement must be felt’ (Ingold,  2011: 60), how is this feeling different?

We attempted to describe, in writing, the process of climbing the tree—providing a trace of 
practice and a verbal and visual record of a moment of starting with trees. Here we write 
as the woodland, that teaches us how to move within it and learn from it. The woodland- 
as- methodology exemplifies how woods exercise their agency to afford opportunities for 
children to learn with/from nature. The woods, rather than being a passive object, actively 
contribute in the ongoing/ness of their encounters with children (Taylor et al., 2021 ). The 
woods also became a co-  teacher (Blenkinsop et al., 2018) and assisted the Forest School 
educator in enabling—in skilling —children to explore their ecological relations and dwelling - 
with nature, rather than (purely) seeing nature-  as- resource or as a detached object of sci -
entific knowledge (see Figure  1).

From here, we could explore what ‘starting with trees’ offers as a perspective. We asked 
the question: What does tree-  climbing teach a child?
If you stop them getting stuck, they will never understand how they got stuck. If they don't 
understand how they got stuck, they have no awareness of the world around them . (Richard, 
Forest School practitioner)
Understanding the relational-  ness of children and trees as they dwell  together means 
attending to the child + tree, seeing how the two are intertwined through embodied skills  
(or their lack), and attending to their histories, relations in a particular moment and place 
(Ingold,  2011 ), which in turn articulate a sense of longing : to climb and be climbed.
SOIL STORIES: SHIFTING PEDAGOGIC REGISTERS
In this trace of practice we offer glimpses into starting with trees as part of a whole-  school 
interdisciplinary learning (IDL) project: Our Local Area. As we suggested above, starting 
with trees is in some ways vital, but in others arbitrary; it enables forms of dwelling, learn -
ing and skilling with other (related) matters, with which we could equally well have started, FIGURE 1  Tree climbed with child. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ]

STARTING WITH TREES
but with which we engage. In this case study, although initially starting with trees, we shift 
to think with soils  via a fusion of scientific techniques and technologies, memories and the 
proliferation of skills  of attentiveness and dwelling - with soils, thinking through the capaci -
ties of soils and how we and other organisms come to know and care for them (Puig De La 
Bellacasa, 2015 ; Salazar et al., 2020 ).
The primary school is on the edge of a northern Scottish city; retreating farmland skirts 
the area around the school, including three straggly pockets of mature trees—the remnants 
of shelter belts planted to protect the ploughed fields of nineteenth and twentieth-  century 
farms. The Treescapes team have been working with classes across the school from pri -
mary 2 to 6 to explore their local area from the perspective of trees. They have compared the 
area where they live and go to school today with what their area looked like 50 and 100 years 
ago, and worked out where their houses (built in the 1980s and 1990s) would have been 
on the old maps of farmland. This piece also explores the decentring of teachers and other 
adults as providers of knowledge and the emergent qualities of learning, which particular 
modes of enacting the curriculum can support (Pahl & Pool, 2021 ).
Framing
It is a cloudy, dryish day in May with intermittent sunshine, the air is cool and the ground 
is damp underfoot. A trail of 8–9 year-  olds have walked with the Treescapes team, their 
teacher and classroom assistant, stopping from time to time to notice the changes in the 
beech trees and the emergent blossom on the cherry and hawthorns. We are in a small 
patch of woodland on the edge of an open parkland, where children come to play and build 
dens out of school. The class is split into two groups, and today we are learning about soil.
We wend our way down a slope, bigger children and adults stooping to get under branches, 
until we reach the edge of a boggy area at the bottom near a stream, where our fieldwork 
will take place. Children are milling about, paddling the mud beneath their feet and waiting 
for the workshop to begin.
Today we are learning about [/from/through] soil  [mud].
Ed is our Treescapes scientist, I am his assistant for the day .
Ed: Why find out about soil?
Children: Animals, ‘I think I saw deer footprints…’ ‘I saw a fox…’ .
Ed: Trees like different soils. What's in soil?
The boy next to me starts to tell me about how the soil was different in India, that when he 
goes to visit relatives it is very hot and very dry [in contrast to the soft, boggy surface we are 
standing on]; in fact, it was so hot his granny let him have ice cream every day.
Demonstrating
Ed has brought the tools he uses for his fieldwork: a soil auger, some distilled water, beakers, 
a red (pH) meter, a blue (conductivity) meter, a soil moisture probe, a Munsell Soil Chart and 
a recording sheet.
Ed: Why do we investigate soil?
Child: To make sure it's healthy .
Ed: What type of plants grow here?
Ed demonstrates the process of collecting a soil sample with the auger and creating a soil 
solution (whose properties can be measured using the field meters). He begins by using the 
auger and shows the children what came out (the soil profile under their feet). They come up

close and look intently… [I am watching the children's feet puddle the mud, rocking from side 
to side, feeling the damp, glutinous mud squelch as they stand and watch Ed.]
Pointing to the earth in the bucket of the auger, Ed notes to the class: ‘ … clay, stones, 
rotten things…’.
Ed's explanations of scientific terms, equipment and purposes are child-  friendly, and the 
children are making links between the recording sheet and the equipment.
Sometimes I ask Ed a question.
Liz: Ed, can you tell us what makes your lab water ‘neutral?’
Ed has a great analogy with bottled mineral water. He asks the children if they know what 
is in bottled water as well as water? They tell him about the minerals listed on the label and 
that water is H2O. Ed explains that if his lab water was in a bottle there would be no minerals 
listed, nothing except water.
Ed explains the pH meter and what kind of reading he expects because the soil is from 
boggy, peaty ground. With a bit of prompting, the children are able to come up with everyday 
examples of what common things they encounter that are acidic. I do not think anyone un -
derstands the blue meter, as it measures the concentration of things in the water (dissolved 
elements). Looking at Ed's diluted solution, a child says ‘ it looks like coffee’.
Moving out:  Proliferating soil knowledges
Now, excited groups of children have a go at augering to take their own samples, from 
different sections of the slope. Their teacher, a soil scientist in a previous life, is very 
involved. She calls out that her group have a worm in their sample. The children observe 
the different colours of soil in their sample, ‘ light at the top, darker underneath ’. There is 
excitement as their teacher recalls just how much she loves the Munsell Soil Chart; she 
and the children together are discussing which shade of colour—from pale cream to dark 
chocolatey brown—best matches the swatch of soil from their sample.
The expert is everywhere as the children use the auger, to collect a sample, smear a bit 
on their recording sheet, create a soil solution, measure its pH and record the number from 
the blue meter and the percentage of water contained in the area that the sample was taken 
from. Their teacher encourages them to make predictions as to which part of the slope will 
be driest and whether there will be a difference in the pH from different parts of the slope. 
Ed takes his samples back to his lab; the children will be taking their recordings back to the 
classroom and will be using the data they have collected to create graphs to represent the 
samples taken from different positions on the slope. Like Ed, they are doing science and 
maths in the ‘real’ world.
MUD PLAYING, MUD GETTING ALONG WITH CHILDREN
With soils still in mind, the pieces of writing below, presented as traces of practice, 
from Bolton and Aberdeen, produce mud as a mode of engagement. We have written 
them in a way that is sensory and embodied; they reflect the way that the intra-  action of 
mud + child joins bodies and materials together and splits them apart (Ingold, 2013 ). This 
work takes from Ingold ( 2011 ) the idea of perception as connected to the object, to the 
‘vibrant matter’ of the woodlands (Bennett, 2010). Here, objects teach us how to learn 
and how to feel our way into the woodlands. We cannot quite grasp what it feels like to 
slide in the mud and break the sticks, or to squelch in it with wellies and fall over. Here 
we describe the children's intra-  action with mud through an immersive description of the 
process we watched.

STARTING WITH TREES
Bolton
A group of three young girls started playing with the mud. The girls' movement with/on the 
mud turned into playing, jumping and stamping. The mud as active material invited the girls 
to feel itself closely through their touches and senses and become part of the mud world 
(Ingold,  2013 ).
The girls grappling the chunks of the mud on their hands. The mud inviting the 
girls to place parts of their bodies on its own body. One of the girls stretches her 
legs and becomes part of the mud. Next to her is another girl sitting on the mud 
and holding the mud in her hands. She slowly starts getting up and looks at the 
mud staying on her hands. She bends her knees and touches the mud. She then 
stood up, slowly leaving the hugging body of the mud and starts tapping on the 
mud with her boots. The other girl joins the jumping game. Both girls move their 
bodies around in a circle, jumping up and down along with the body of the mud. 
The mud jumps up and down along with girls and girls' boots also joining the 
jumps. The mud stays in the air for a while and then falls on the ground. The third 
girl watching the other two girls. Later, she joins the moving crew with the mud 
and with girls. She slowly walks on the mud, jumps on the tree log, and watches 
girls and the mud walking and jumping. She jumps on the tree log, standing and 
watching, walking, stamping on the mud, seeing and feeling the mud on their 
hands.
Girls being part of it and letting the mud be part of them (Ingold, 2013 ) and engaging a 
self- discovery mode of learning through playing with the mud. As we watched—adults in a 
play space—we were drawn through the children's engagement with mud to their engage -
ment with twigs.
The girls playing with twigs, picking mud from the ground, carrying the mud on twigs and 
gently rubbing the mud on the surface of the tree log.
Making a thick layer of the mud on the tree trunk.
Working together, we can hear girls whispering and talking about layers of mud on the 
tree log. Hearing small voices of the mud when it rides on the twig to be placed on the tree 
log. The mud sticking and getting along with the tree log. At the same time being moved in 
a circle on the tree log, touching twigs and human hands.
Aberdeen
Throughout the time, children are engaging in the scientific, systematic sampling of soil 
(see ‘soil stories’ above) and recording its texture, colour, pH and consistency, children are 
carrying out their own embodied explorations of the soil/earth/mud beneath their feet.
In the bog. A girl in pink and black spotty wellies squelched until she fell over and in, 
there's lots of laughter from the child and her teacher, who helps to pull her out minus one 
of her wellies.
While Ed is demonstrating how to use the auger, one boy is intently watching, and two 
others are watching each other and testing out the bog beneath their feet. One goes right in 
with one foot and squelches, the other in wellies, also keeps testing.
Another small group of children paddle the mud. Feet engaged and eyes watching their 
feet beneath them.
After completing their soil sample, one group asks me if they can explore … they head off 
to the burn which runs at the other side of the bog.

PLAYING DENS, MAKING AND LEARNING
Here we describe the process of learning in the woods. This involved children learning about 
coppicing, den building and hedgerow making from the coppiced wood. In the United Kingdom, 
coppicing is a traditional, locally honed process of cutting back low branches to make the tree 
produce straight sticks. Coppicing took place on the mature trees planted in the Forest School. 
Is dwelling a tentative, precarious form of dwelling , creating a site for belonging ?
This is a way of enabling children to learn to live with nature in harmony, to help it live 
longer without exploiting it, as the Forest School teacher (Richard) explained in an interview 
filmed by us: We don't cut down the tree, we coppice trees and we can use this coppiced like 
these hedgerows  (interview, 14 March 2023).
These stories of mud playing and den making let children manage their own personal 
risks, self-  regulate and understand the value of group work. They also enable the children 
to learn traditional skills , honed over centuries in this region of England—but without nec -
essarily being weighed down by the history or any perceived ‘rightness’ of those skills. As 
we watched, children were going into the den and coming out of it, holding bricks and tree 
twigs. These are also about (literally) constructing the curriculum as a combination of under -
standing the trees, understanding the relation on a set of trees and children, and how these 
relations can be seen as valuable. These could be described, in the words of Community 
Forester Dave Armson, from The Mersey Forest (and one of the paper's authors), as ‘ wood -
land methodologies ’.
This understanding of human and tree relations is generated through children's ongoing 
engagement in coppicing, den and hedge making. Knowledge of tree/human relations is not 
understood as a transmission of complex structures and classified as thinking or making 
(Ingold,  2011). Like the encounters with soil and mud, knowledge of/with treescapes is open- 
ended, proliferating, continually ongoing (Horton & Kraftl, 2006 ), equally processing bodies, 
actions and perception in every movement (Ingold, 2011 : 159).
GETTING THE MEASURE OF TREES
Back in Bolton, we are measuring trees. Year 3 (ages 7–8) children accompanied by our 
research team including two scientists, an artist, a philosopher, a geographer, two childhood 
studies researchers and class teachers were in the school playground. Each group of children 
was asked to find a tree and measure it using special diameter tapes to measure the trunks 
through the (apparently) age-  old skill of taking its diameter at breast height (rather ironic, 
given the height of the tree). Children were also expected to observe and note down tree 
diameters on worksheets. These worksheets were specifically designed by our colleagues 
(scientists).
Children in all groups were measuring trees with tapes, recording their observations on 
the worksheets and filming the activity. As with the proliferation of activities invoked by the 
soil science in our earlier case study, we noted how different modes—including using tab -
lets, writing boards, paper worksheets, trees, green grassy fields, the school playground, 
the fence surrounding the school field, tree shades, measuring tapes, children's bodies and 
their senses—were all becoming, unbecoming and re-  becoming part (Jewitt et al., 2017 ) of 
the ‘measuring the tree’ activity. We use snippets of video footage recorded by the children 
to describe the trees, to tease out the ways in which the measuring activity became a com -
plex, interconnected, multiple and situated activity.
We found out that there are thousands of ways to measure a tree (Pahl et al., forthcoming ).
In Table  1, the relationship between the elements becomes clearer if a wider multimodal 
analytic gaze is placed on the trees and the children together. Drawing on the work of

STARTING WITH TREES
Flewitt et al. (2009 ), we produced an analytic table that paid attention to the child's gaze, 
including patterns of bodily movement, sensory activity, the affective and the feel of interac -
tions with trees, alongside other children's movements, together with speech and language 
plus the tree itself. The children made a vast quantity of videos (over 300) during their tree- 
planting and tree-  measuring experiences. Watching them through showed a myriad of ways 
in which the children interacted with trees, from climbing, hugging, talking, becoming, seeing 
trees as actors and experiencing bark (Pahl et al., forthcoming ). Our mechanism for under -
standing this was close multimodal analysis of the children's own videos. With the stance 
of learning from children's perspectives, rather than extracting data (see Spyrou, 2023 ), an 
attentiveness to these traces produced new theoretical insights into children's relationship 
with trees, leading to the concept of starting with trees.
Our table emphasises the objects, sense, talk, actions and movement associated with the 
tree. The tree also becomes an actor in the process of being engaged with. This produces 
an account of tree/child relations which moves the human—the child—in and out of focus 
(Kraftl,  2020 ).
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have sought to open out dwelling, skilling and (be)longing as a non-  
exhaustive framework for research and pedagogies through which we can learn to move, 
feel and learn in, through and with treescapes. Equally, this framework might afford a 
starting point for doing so in other environments, however characterised. The three con -
cepts offer a framework, which enables a more experiential and felt mode of engagement, 
in contrast to many forms of curricula and approaches to environmental education that are 
more decontextualised. This then opens out a new way of conceiving education through 
experience.
Not only are there thousands of ways to measure a tree, but also thousands of ways to 
start with trees . Thousands of ways of dwelling , skilling  and (be)longing . In this paper, via a 
series of traces of research–practice–learning, we have sought to open out—to proliferate  
and render ongoing and unrestricted—how starting with trees can invoke so many other 
material forms and processes, embodied practices, utterances, feelings and forms of learn -
ing. All of these modes of proliferation weave, stretch and even break free from lines that 
take us—mud, researchers, soils, children, sticks, teachers, soils, practitioners, dens—on 
journeys between and beyond environmental education. This resonates with work that fo -
cuses closely on children's engagement with the materialities of trees (e.g., see Harwood & 
Collier, 2017 ).
Dwelling  requires, in part, an attunement and responsiveness to place (Lynch & 
Mannion, 2021 ). Yet, that attunement does not necessarily require the acquisition or even 
awareness of particular  histories or knowledge about a place. It may, in fact, not matter pre -
cisely where  we start with trees (in the sense of being at a particular, named place). Perhaps 
paradoxically, some aspects of dwelling with trees require particular forms of disposition, 
and engagement with the material facets of a space—sticks, dens, branches, trunks—and 
with the technologies that we may have to hand—rules, tapes, laser scanners, clipboards, 
tablets. If dwelling is fundamentally about forging some kind of (even temporary) connection 
with a space, through climbing, playing, squelching, stroking, then in some ways it can take 
place anywhere, starting with any tree (as our critique of some forms of environmental edu -
cation, in the early parts of this paper, suggested).
Skilling  may also proceed through particular dispositions, but operates in a way that 
does not foreclose multiple ways of knowing or learning about trees. For skilling may 
 14693518, 2025, 2, Downloaded from https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/berj.4099 by Capes, Wiley Online Library on [18/09/2025].

KRAFTL  et al .
also involve the admixture of ‘traditional’ forestry techniques—such as coppicing—that 
may be peculiar to a region or even a specific place, and their unique ways of managing 
the land that may stretch back for centuries. Moreover, skilling may involve and invoke 
‘scientific’ knowledges and techniques—measuring pH or the diameter of a tree at breast 
height, learning what a laser scanner does, calculating the carbon mass of a tree through 
an established technique. What we have sought to highlight in the case studies above, 
however, is how such historical and scientific knowledges—which may come to dominate 
environmental education, and especially learning about trees—might move in and out of 
focus (Kraftl, 2020 ), becoming woven into a proliferation of ways for learning about and 
experiencing trees. Other stories—children's memories, stories passed through gener -
ations, speculative accounts—may warrant equal attention and, in fact, combine with 
dominant historical or scientific knowledges to produce even more powerful accounts of 
what trees do, and our relationships with them. Perhaps the real skill is in enabling those 
knowledges to combine and proliferate, and in finding ways to account for the learn -
ing that might ensue. This would require a disciplinary, methodological and professional 
openness, modesty and willingness to cede some  control.
(Be)longing —understood as an affective condition that arises from encounters with trees 
and treescapes—witnesses the ongoingness and incompleteness of starting with trees. 
(Be)longing folds together pasts (including skilling), presents (including dwelling) and futures 
(through longing, hope and desire). Those futures might stretch from the apparently simple, 
immediate desire to climb a tree, or to get the measure of a treescape, to plans for a future 
treescape yet to be planted, its care, its potential for play or promulgating greater liveliness, 
vibrancy and diversity (the latter understood in both social and ecological senses). (Be)
longing—perhaps more so than dwelling and skilling—is something that not only moves be -
tween mainstream pedagogies of environmental education but beyond: it is febrile, slippery, 
intangible, ephemeral. Yet, as Bennett ( 2010) reminds us, the constant vibrancy and move -
ment of the world does not mean that, as humans, we should abrogate our responsibility for 
it: this goes as much for attempts to address climate change and environmental degradation 
as it does our ways of learning about it and hoping for better futures. Hence, (be)longing 
should more properly only operate in combination with dwelling, skilling and manifold other 
ways of conceiving, feeling, engaging and starting - with trees, to which this paper has only 
begun to attend.
Taken together, it is our contention that dwelling–skilling–(be)longing offer a framework—
only a framework, but we argue a very important one—for future research and pedagogic 
practice in environmental and climate change education. We provided embodied traces of 
practice to offer insights into what such research and practice might look like, although these 
are meant as points of departure, invitations to consider and experiment, rather than as any 
kinds of ‘exemplars’. Yet, we argue, they afford ways of starting with trees that might enable 
a proliferation of ways to work, play, move, feel, hope and even enact change—between and 
beyond environmental education.
