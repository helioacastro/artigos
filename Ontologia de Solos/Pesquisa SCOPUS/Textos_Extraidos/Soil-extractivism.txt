CAP ABSTRACT  
This article examines how specific (non-relational) political ontological understandings of soils are incorporated 
into industrial agricultural politics in the European Union and introduces a complementary contribution to 
existing literature with the concept of soil extractivism. The concept is used to describe current institutionalized 
ways of relating to soils and their dynamics of power. Through an integrative literature review, the article links 
existing research on soils with the development of modern agriculture in Europe. The theoretical contribution of 
soil extractivism provides a conceptual tool for understanding currently dominant ways of treating soils as a key 
part of modernity and industrial capitalism as well as part of wider destructions of multispecies relations.   
1.Introduction 
The current moment is characterized by multiple crises which pre-
sent cascading threats to the survival and livability of humans and other- 
than-human life. Climate emergency and global biodiversity loss are the 
most obvious manifestations of these. In addition (or in entanglement), 
different landscapes, bodies, and waterways are depleted and permeated 
with toxic matter, while the radical simplification of ecosystems and the 
fragmentation of relations signify an overall degradation of diverse 
multispecies existence (Haraway 2015 ). One less-studied example of this 
fragmentation and depletion of life is the global eradication of soils as 
complex living entities (Pardo et al., 2020 ; Engel-Di Mauro 2014 ). While 
the future of agriculture and societal life are dependent on the health of 
soils and soil biota (and increasingly recognized as such by scientists, 
policy-makers, and farmers; see, e.g., FAO and ITPS 2015 ; Montgomery 
2007 ; Krzywoszynska 2019 ; (Gebremehdin et al., 2022 ) and, as early as 
the 1800s, e.g., Marx 1976 ), the multispecies nature of soils and the 
wider implications of systemic soil abuse have only recently begun to 
attract increasing interest in social and multidisciplinary science 
(Krzywoszynska 2019 ; Engel-Di Mauro 2014 ). This article aims to fill 
part of that gap by examining how specific ontological notions of soils 
are institutionalized in modern industrial agricultural practices and 
drive what I term soil extractivism . The urgency to gain better under -
standing of the systemic drivers behind the loss of soils is concretized in 
a report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (2019), 
according to which, arable soils throughout the world are being lost about 100 times faster than they are being formed in ploughed areas and 
10–20 times faster even in non-ploughed areas. In addition, the systemic 
over-fertilization of croplands has led to wide-scale problems in soil 
health, loss of biodiversity, and the pollution of waterways (IPCC 2019 ). 
In 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) issued a stern warning that, with the current rate of soil loss, 
agricultural production might face catastrophic collapses in the coming 
decades. 
Although my research is fundamentally somewhat “undisciplined ”, 
my thinking in this article arises from the fields of political ontology, 
political ecology, critical agrarian studies, environmental justice, and 
multispecies anthropology, as well as world-ecological examinations of 
past erasures of nature in the face of industrial development (Moore 
2010 ). The article links these conversations with the development of 
modern industrial agriculture in Europe and how it relates to the use and 
abuse of soils. Within this framework, I offer an examination of the 
historically institutionalized understandings of soils that are incorpo -
rated in the model of agriculture driven by the European Union ’s agri-
cultural politics (currently dominated by the EU’s Common Agricultural 
Policy, CAP) and examine these understandings in conjunction with 
politics of power and capital accumulation. This allows me to demon -
strate how historically and politically specific conceptions of soils and 
multispecies life fundamentally guide and determine modern agricul -
tural practices and policies and thus the treatment of soils. Building on 
this analysis, I propose a conceptual contribution with the term soil 
extractivism , which refers to a mode of capital accumulation and profit

2production achieved through depletion and violent re-organization of 
soils ’ multispecies life, in order to produce crops that are treated as 
commodities. As such, soil extractivism names a key process and a set of 
practices in which soils multispecies lives ’ are mined to facilitate a 
specific modernist, industrialized and politically centralized relation to 
soils and land. 
This article argues that thinking about soils and thinking with soils 
can provide vital openings for holistic understandings of current global 
multi-crises and ways out of them. Building on a wide set of multidis -
ciplinary studies on soils and cross-pollinating this with a political 
ontological analysis, I demonstrate that the degradation of soils and soil 
biota are representations of systemic destruction and re-organization of 
life and landscapes driven by extractivist practices, capital accumula -
tion, and economies centered on growth. As discussed by Salazar et al. 
(2020b: 5), soils are the perfect companion to ‘think with, ’ as they 
enable a nuanced recognition of “the complex blend of socio-political 
predicaments and physico-material negotiations of planetary boundary 
conditions and safe operating spaces. ” 
By bringing together the Latin American theory of Political Ontology 
(de la de la Cadena and Blaser, 2018 ; Blaser, 2009) and the theoretical 
framework of global extractivism (Chagnon et al., 2022 ), the study 
proposes a complementary contribution to existing literature bridging 
multiple on-going discussions related to agriculture, natural resource 
politics, extinction, agrarian change, and biodiversity loss. It is also 
important to note that, while this article focuses on industrial agricul -
ture and agricultural politics in Europe (and more specifically in the 
European Union), very similar and in many cases more severe and 
destructive processes are occurring all over the world, especially in the 
Global South, and these are all representative of a wider 
world-ecological and world-historical process. 
The timeframe for my analysis in this article begins in the 1850s, 
which marks the beginning of the industrial and agricultural revolution 
in Europe, which engendered major changes in agricultural practices 
characterized by intensification and expansion of land use, mechaniza -
tion and chemicalization of farming, specialization of production, and 
an increased focus on monocultural and large-scale farming. Within this 
timeframe, I also focus on the decades following the Second World War 
(post-1945) as a boundary period during which the aforementioned 
practices became deployed and institutionalized across most European 
countries. This process was due to international political and economic 
pressures and, to a large extent, the foundation of the EU’s Common 
Agricultural Policy (CAP). I thus treat the case study of the CAP as a 
political and legal institutionalization of the more general world-making 
(i.e. political ontological) processes of modernization and capitalism as 
ways of organizing the web-of-life. 
1.1. Political ontology 
This article is based on a critical and integrative examination of 
existing scholarly contributions on the ontological and multispecies 
politics of soils and agriculture. The method of analysis is an integrative 
literature review, which is a form of research that reviews, critiques and 
synthesizes representative literature on a given topic in an integrated 
manner in order to generate novel frameworks, conceptualizations and 
perspectives on the topic (Torraco 2005 ). I will use this method in 
conjunction with a political ontological analysis of the European 
Union ’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which I will feed and 
cross-pollinate with social scientific and more-than-human philosophies 
on soils. 
By political ontological analysis (from de la Cadena and Blaser, 
2018 ), I refer to the critical examination of the different socially shared 
ways in which people understand how the world is, what exists, how 
things relate to each other, and the politics and frictions of these 
meaning-makings (de la Cadena and Blaser, 2018 ; Blaser 2009). More 
specifically, in this article I use political ontology as a theoretical 
framework with a specific focus on how certain realities (i.e. worlds) are done, enacted and made visible (while others are undone and made 
invisible) through extractivist industrial agricultural practices and pol-
itics. I thus examine the different politically institutionalized forms of 
relating to and using soils (in this case industrial agriculture and the 
CAP) as particular modes of being in and of making worlds . 
Differing from a specific field of study within philosophy (ontology 
as a study of being,1 with its own set of theoretical work) (Campbell 
2020 ), political ontology as a theoretical lens emerged from research in 
anthropology (see e.g. Viveiros de Castro, 1998 ; De la Cadena 2015; 
Blaser, 2009) , actor network theory, and science and technology studies 
(Latour, 1993 ; Law 1999 , 2008 ; Mol, 1999). These works examine both 
the frictions between different ways of understanding and making re-
alities (i.e. worldings/world-makings) (e.g. de La Cadena 2015), and the 
ontological power of modernity (e.g. Latour, 1993 ; Law 1999 ; Mol, 
1999 ).2 A particular focus in political ontology is also on the ways in 
which modernity creates a single, universal view of reality that is 
enacted, imposed upon, and expanded to occupy all other ways of being 
(a phenomena Law [1999] refers to as the ‘one-world-world ’, and which 
takes the form of colonial expansion and destruction of different life-
worlds, both human and non-human). Within empirical research, po-
litical ontology thus often presents itself as a way of examining the 
struggles, contestations and conflicts between diverse lifeworlds and 
diverging world-making practices (Blaser 2009; Law, 2015 ). 
Some recent work which examines both political ontology and 
extractivisms (see e.g. Chagnon et al., 2022 ; Kroger 2021 ; Ehrnstr om--
Fuentes 2022 ) provides insights on how extractivist processes (with 
related processes such as commodification) can be understood as sys-
temic and globalized enactments of modernity, which render and 
re-organize physical landscapes and multispecies relations (including 
humans) in accordance with western, modernist or human-centric 
ontological imaginaries. This paper is a continuation of such work, in 
as it aims to show how historically and politically specific ontological 
understandings of soils are institutionally enacted onto rural landscapes 
through political projects such as the European Union ’s Common Agri-
cultural Policy (CAP), and which materially take the form of soil 
extractivism . 
By approaching industrial agriculture ’s (and more widely modern -
ity’s) relations to soils through the use of political ontology, the issues of 
non-human agency, relational materiality, instrumentality of different 
imaginaries on soils, and the politics of soil abuse are central to my 
exploration. Through a political ontological analysis, I aim to uncover 
the specific practices and ontological foundations which drive the 
erasure of multispecies life within soils and examine to what extent the 
dominant agricultural politics in the EU are framed by and perpetuate 
these ‘ontologics. ’ The main focus is on mapping out the theoretical 
aspects of the political ontological foundations of soil-erasing practices 
in Europe. The case study of the CAP functions as an empirical example 
within which both the grand historical processes of destruction of soil as 
other-than-human life and the ontological foundations of soil extracti -
vism can be examined. 
1My use of political ontology as a theoretical frame is also built on an un-
derstanding of ontology that is not separate from epistemology, thus aban-
doning the stubborn notion that separates knowing from being (which in itself 
expresses specific dualistic western ontology, see e.g. Watts 2013 ).  
2 Political ontology as a theoretical framework also gives emphasis to how 
mundane practices and relational interactions of both human and other-than- 
human beings enact or perform worlds and realities into existence (Campbell 
2020 ; Blaser 2009; Mol, 1999). Moving beyond human-centrism, worlds are not 
only enacted through intentional human actions, but in continuous corre -
spondence with the materials and relations between human and non-human 
agents (Campbell 2020 ), such as soil and its multispecies existence. S. Hokkanen

31.2. Research gap and the case for studying political ontology in European 
agriculture 
Social scientific understanding of soil loss has long been dominated 
by political economic or agrarian studies analyses, while soils as rela-
tional materialities have remained rather under-explored (Krzy-
woszynska 2019 ). Some of the earliest social and political science 
examinations of the significance of soil loss come from Marx (1976) , 
who posited both soil and labor as the original sources of wealth and 
argued that capitalist progress is fundamentally founded on robbing 
them both.3 Marx ’s work has been influential in the field of political 
ecology and in other critical analyses on the exploitation of soils, as seen, 
for example, in the seminal work of Piers Blaikie (1985) , who studied the 
political economy of soil erosion in what he called ‘the developed 
world. ’ Although there are some foundational contributions for example 
within political ecology and environmental humanities that diverge 
from conventional ways of conceptualizing human –soil relations (see, e. 
g. Tironi et al., 2020 ; Engel-Di Mauro 2014 ; de la Bellacasa 2014; 
Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020 ; Lyons 2014; 2020 ), the majority of 
studies in the social sciences continue to treat soils as static (rather than 
living) matter (Krzywoszynska 2019 ). Even though much of natural 
scientific soil science has long examined soils as complex living entities 
(Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ), the majority of research on soils outside the 
natural sciences has treated them merely as “governable, ownable, 
controllable ” land (Krzywoszynska 2019 : 662) and as a resource for food 
production (Salazar et al., 2020b ).4 This is further exemplified by Tironi 
et al.’s (2020: 19) concept of the “un-theorization of soil,” which refers 
to a “form of soil determinism which conceptualizes soil health as 
essential to human life, agricultural productivity, and adaptation to 
environmental change, ” while still placing soil outside the scope of 
human social existence. Some recent scholarly contributions neverthe -
less provide exceptions to this trend. Such studies include María Puig De 
la Bellacasa and María, 2014 ; 2015 , 2017 , 2021 ) pioneering work on soil 
temporalities, care, and soils as bio-infrastructure, Anna Krzywoszynska 
and Marchesi, 2020 in-depth conceptualizations of the relational ma-
teriality of soils, Kristina Lyons ’ (2020) brilliant book on vital decom -
position, and the work of Salazar et al. (2020a) on the material politics 
and social theory of soils. Additionally, Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro (2014) 
provides an eco-social approach and a social theory for understanding 
soil degradation in conjunction with capitalist production and social 
relations, without essentializing soil degradation merely as a capitalist 
problem. My article aims to think with this insightful set of work and 
offer a contribution which ties new knots between existing literature, in 
order to conceptualize soils and care for soils in conjunction with his-
torically emergent and contemporary practices in industrial agriculture 
and global extractivisms. Although political ontological examinations of extractivisms have 
increased in recent years (see e.g. Lassila 2021 ; Stensrud 2019 ; 
Ehrnstr om-Fuentes 2022 ; Kroger 2021 ; Tornel 2023 ), there remains a 
need to expand the analytical breadth and depth of how extractivisms 
take an important part in making and unmaking worlds. Research on 
extractivism5 has thus far exhibited a strong geographical focus on Latin 
America (Nygren et al., 2022 ), with an increasing amount of literature 
on the Arctic (see, e.g., Kroger 2016 ; Wilson and Stammler 2016 ), Africa 
(see, e.g., Hamouchene 2021 ; Greco 2020 ; Ayelazuno 2019 ; Hargreaves 
2016 ; Nogueira et al., 2017 ) and Asia (see, e.g., Tapiheru et al., 2022 ; 
Kroger 2020 ; Rowedder and Tappe 2022 ). Due to world-systemic 
structures of coloniality, extractivist processes have been most promi -
nent and overtly violent in the Global South, manifesting in the sys-
tematic plunder of marginalized people and lands in order to build 
modernity and fuel growth in the Global North (Chagnon et al., 2022 ; 
Moore 2015 ; Galeano 1997 ). Because of these specific world-historical 
and world-systemic dynamics, many key theoretical contributions on 
extractivism have understandably arisen from global political economic 
analyses with a focus on world-systems analysis and core-periphery 
dynamics (Acosta, 2013 ; Bunker 1988 ). 
Additionally, a lot of the theoretical research on political ontology 
and agriculture has focused on issues related to ontological conflicts and 
indigenous world-making (important exceptions being e.g. Campbell 
2020 ; Kumpf 2021 ). As such, there is a need to further expand political 
ontological examinations of extractivisms and industrial agriculture in 
order to understand processes of world-making which do not necessarily 
occur in the frontiers or edges of modernity and capitalism, but rather at 
their assumed cores. In addition, political ontological analysis can 
further enrich theoretical work in fields such as agrarian and peasant 
studies in conceptualizing the long-studied processes such as agricul -
tural industrialization and changes within peasantry as expansions and 
impositions of specific kinds of human and other-than-human worlds. 
Therefore, while continuing to build on the important set of the litera -
ture within political ontology and extractivisms, I also diverge from it by 
examining political ontologies of extractivism within a European 
context. 
The motivation for this focus is twofold. First, by examining 
extractivisms in Europe through a Latin American-derived theory of 
political ontology, I aim to produce knowledge which de-normalizes and 
deconstructs realities that are predominantly taken for granted, or even 
viewed as a model for normality. This approach is also intended to 
demonstrate how modernity and capitalism are based on ecocide across 
the globe rather than solely within the frontier areas of global capital -
ism. Second, I wish to show how the loss of multispecies life and the 
degradation of soils and landscapes has come to be considered normal in 
Europe, partly because of the gradualness and long-established nature of 
the destruction (discussed, e.g., by Ollinaho 2015 ). This has also meant 
that the conflicts and struggles over different rural lifeworlds have not 
been examined from political ontological perspectives to any great 
extent, as they have often been framed as either issues related to farmers 
livelihoods or environmental considerations (rather than issues of ex-
istences). Due to the assumed normality of soil degradation and multi -
species loss, the destruction of lands and beings in European landscapes 
has become invisible and overlooked, thus creating “environments of 
lived erasure ” (Dunlap 2021 : 213). 
2.Overlooking existences and the political ontology of soils 
Soils are important on a number of scales. These include the micro- 
level relations between individual soil organisms and the macro-level 
issues of storing carbon, growing food, and providing habitat, as well 
as the global interactions with water cycles, atmospheres, and oceans 3 Nonetheless, a large part of Marx ’s writing on the foundations of soil 
exhaustion was misinformed to some extent, as it was based on the theories of 
agricultural chemistry of his time (which were fundamentally modernist and 
emphasized a mechanistic and chemical understanding of soils, as well as being 
permeated with colonial and racist narratives), which resulted in Marx actually 
promoting for the intensification, mechanization, and chemical fertilization in 
agriculture and calling rotational and regenerative agricultural practices a 
“fairy-tale ” (Marx 2016 : 729) (pace Saito 2017 ).  
4 However it is extremely important to note that many of the overarching 
notions such as relational materiality, human-animal relations, multispecies 
care, or any forms of “radical alterity ” (Graeber 2015 ) discussed as part of the 
so-called ‘ontological turn’ in social sciences have been written about by many 
indigenous thinkers for decades (see Todd, 2015 ; Kimmerer 2013 ; Hunt 2014 ; 
Watts 2013 ; Deloria et al., 2001 ; Tallbear & Wiley 2019 ; Kopenawa and Albert 
2013 ). Therefore, building on Todd (2015) , ideas such as relational and 
multispecies existence or ontological erasure (of for example soils) are not re-
alizations or new conceptualizations which arose from anthropology or western 
philosophical thought, but that they are also embodied, lived and fought-for 
realities of many indigenous life-worlds. 5 The concept of extractivism is further explained in the later section 
“Theoretical contribution: Soil Extractivism. ” S. Hokkanen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Journal of Rural Studies 108 (2024) 103298
4(Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 2020; Schulte et al., 2015). Soils partic -
ipate in and drive the majority of all biological and chemical processes 
that make Earth habitable (Salazar et al., 2020b; Krzywoszynska and 
Marchesi 2020; Engel-Di Mauro 2014). As discussed by de la Bellacasa 
(2021), soils are a vital medium through which the dead and minerals 
are turned back to (and for) living earthly beings. Additionally, while 
being completely inseparable from their wider environment, soils are 
also a manifestation of moving matter in themselves (De la Bellacasa 
2020b; Hird 2009). Just a teaspoon of rich soil contains about a billion 
bacteria and thousands of fungi, single-celled organisms, and nematodes 
(de la Bellacasa 2019). Moreover, algae numbers can vary between 3 
and 100 million in 1 g of soil (Kutílek and Nielsen 2015). In addition to 
microbial life, there also exist immense amounts of different macro -
fauna, such as centipedes, millipedes, slugs, snails, larvae, and spiders 
(Kutílek and Nielsen 2015). It has been estimated that around 25% of all 
species diversity is found in soils (FAO 2020), while only 1–2% of soil 
microorganisms have been identified (Orgiazzi et al., 2016). This being 
said, there exists no static ‘natural state’ of soils, but soils in whatever 
state they are, are always constituted and composed from wider re-
lations and geo-physical processes, both within and beyond the soil 
(through interactions that include or do not include humans, as dis-
cussed e.g. in Engel-Di Mauro [2014]). 
From a relational multispecies perspective, soils are entire worlds in 
themselves, in which organisms and inorganic materials dwell in tight 
co-constitutive relations. Soils defy any attempts to analyze materiality 
and agency as separate categories, as soils are not merely a habitat for 
different beings; rather, the soil itself is made of those beings. In other 
words, the structure of the soil and its fertility are synonymous with the 
different beings living, dying, and decaying within and as the soil, 
together with the soil’s mineral and geological components (Tironi 
et al., 2020; Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 2020). The process of how 
soils come to be also emphasizes decomposition, which disrupts any 
notion of creation without breakdown, or life without death (de la 
Bellacasa 2021). 
The treatment and ontological notions of soils are fundamentally 
intertwined. In other words, how soils are understood affects and to 
some extent creates the ways in which they are cared for or (ab)used (de 
la Bellacasa 2015). The dominant way in which soils are currently 
treated in modern industrial agriculture and agricultural politics is 
characterized by Anna Krzywoszynska (2020) as part of an 
agro-productivist mindset and status quo that posits soil as a passive 
resource. Such an ontological framing renders the labor and lives of 
soils’ multispecies assemblages as static matter (i.e., dirt, with all that 
word’s negative connotations). However, historically, the definition of 
soil and its ontological status in relation to human life have undergone 
many changes (Hartemink 2016), and they continue to be debated both 
within scientific and political discourses on soil management (Krzy -
woszynska and Marchesi 2020; Engel-Di Mauro 2014. Engel-Di Mauro 
(2014) for example emphasizes that as with any form of producing 
knowledge, soil science is inextricably dependent on the social context it 
develops in. He also emphasizes the political nature of defining soil 
quality and discusses how techno-scientific notions of soils have become 
complicit in promoting agricultural commodification (Engel Di-Mauro 
2014). Similarly, building on a review of soil science (Hartemink 
2016), Krzywoszynska and Marchesi (2020) note that the changing 
definitions and different understandings of soil always arise in relation 
to technological and agronomic developments, in conjunction with 
wider societal needs and interests. 
As discussed by Krzywoszynska and Marchesi (2020), the currently 
dominant understandings of agricultural soils are rooted in emergent 
knowledge systems that gained ground during early industrialization 
and post-Enlightenment in Europe. The aforementioned agro- 
productivist and reductionist understanding of soils as passive and 
static thus arises from a wider set of historically institutionalized as-
sumptions, such as notions of a nature-society dichotomy, nature as a 
passive resource, human exceptionality, and the idea of the world as a mechanistic entity (rather than relational) (building on Moore [2015] 
and Plumwood [1993]). More specifically, the currently dominant way 
of treating soils in industrial agriculture (and modern societies in gen-
eral), is founded on theories of soil fertility introduced by the German 
chemists Carl Sprengel, in the 1820s, and Justus von Liebig, in the 1840s 
(Van der Ploeg et al., 1999; Marchesi 2020; Clapp 2023), which paved 
the way for modern agricultural science6 and “set agriculture on its in-
dustrial path” (Pollan 2006: 146). 
Liebig’s work was motivated by the notion that soil exhaustion was a 
result of ‘primitive’ agricultural practices and could be completely 
overcome with mineral fertilization (Saito 2017). Liebig’s theory (which 
became better known than Sprengel’s) introduced a mineral under -
standing of soil fertility (rather than organic or humus-based) that 
promoted the idea of soil as an inert growing medium and essentially 
disregarded aspects such structure, humidity, oxygen-levels, density, 
and the billions of beings that make and inhabit the soil (Marchesi 2020; 
Saito 2017). This passive chemical understanding of soils thus simplified 
the issue of how to increase yields to a question of what chemical sub-
stances need to be added to the soil (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 
2020). Operationalized into practice, this meant that farmers were 
simply required to adjust a cocktail of a few chemical elements—in 
practice, mainly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (Uekoetter 2006; 
Pollan 2006). With this reliance on chemical inputs, soils could thus 
continue to “fulfill their function” as a medium for growing crops, with 
no regard for the overall health of soils as living ecosystems (Krzy -
woszynska 2019: 665). 
Liebig’s theory initiated a radical shift in agricultural practices and 
laid the foundation for a form of agricultural science that could be 
universalized into a ‘one size fits all’ kind of agriculture (Marchesi 
2020). This in turn served the interests of European countries aiming to 
industrialize and feed growing populations, as it enabled the 
geographical expansion and intensification of agrarian capitalism dur-
ing the same period (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 2020). Following this 
ontological marginalization, soils came to be regarded as an infra-
structure and an invisible background (de la Bellacasa 2014; building on 
Star 1999). This, as I will later show, was firmly institutionalized in 
European agricultural politics post-WWII. 
Another important aspect of the political ontology of soils in Europe 
concerns the separation of soil from the rest of the landscape and the life 
‘above-ground.’ Philosophers such as Kant, Immanuel, 1933: 606 in 
Ingold 2015) described the earth as “a flat surface, with a circular 
horizon”— a mere stage for human life. According to Ingold (2015), this 
kind of understanding completely fails to recognize the life of soils and 
its relations with all other lifeforms, thus positing land and anything 
below-ground as formless matter, the physical stuff of the world. What is 
central here is the disregard not only for the multispecies agential ex-
istence of the below-ground, but also for the dynamic and 
co-constitutive relationality that crosses and deletes the assumed 
boundary between above and below ground. This failure to recognize 
that human existence is not separate from what is invisible or below 
ground is what ecologist David Wolfe (2001 in Lyons 2020) calls ‘surface 
chauvinism.’ 
What however enables and creates the existence of, for example, 
both microbes or a root system below ground and a grazing mammal 
above ground is the movement of matter, of living and dead bodies 
between and within the soil and the rest of the world, which are moved 
by the labor and actions of different multispecies agents (such as the 
farmer, the grazing animal, burrowing nematodes, pecking birds, and 
the growing crop). In this sense, just like the microbes, fungi, and 
6 Interestingly, Liebig also significantly influenced Marx’s theorization of 
metabolism and soil exhaustion (although Marx did later distance his work 
from Liebig’s theories), which explains Marx’s early optimism about the pos-
sibility of continued improvements in agricultural productivity (Saito 2017) 
and which is indicative of the modernist ontological basis of Marx’s work. S. Hokkanen

5macrofauna within the soil, it could well be argued that the manure- 
producing and grazing livestock and the ploughing, sowing, and har-
vesting farmer are also species of the soil and inseparable parts of the 
process that determine its health and livability. In later sections, I 
demonstrate how the separation between the ‘physical stuff ’ of soil, its 
laborers, and the remaining agricultural practices is at the core of in-
dustrial agricultural organization and politics. This is evident, for 
example, in the extractivist treatment of soil as a pool of resources and in 
the expanding separation of livestock production and other land prac-
tices, such as crop production. 
2.1. Power and politics in soil ontologies 
It is important to note that the heterogeneous field of soil science has 
long distanced itself from a mere chemical and a-biotic understanding of 
soils and shifted toward the current definitions of soils as living systems 
(Lyons 2020 ). Therefore, the issue of unsustainability in soil manage -
ment is not a question of lack of knowledge per se. Additionally, even in 
the 1850s, the reductionist, simplified notion of soils promoted by Liebig 
and other modernist chemists of his time did not arise because it was 
according to the best available scientific or practical knowledge (Saito 
2017 ; Manlay et al., 2007 ), but because such thinking served the in-
terests of the rapidly industrializing and urbanizing societies of early 
capitalism7 (Marchesi 2020). Even Liebig himself later criticized agri-
cultural principles that relied solely on external chemical inputs (what 
he called ‘chemical hocus pocus ’) and defended the idea that soil fertility 
depended on reciprocity and the recycling of nutrients, which he dis-
cussed in his 1861 book The Search for Agricultural Recycling (Shiva 
2022 ). Therefore, the main significance of Liebig ’s contribution to in-
dustrial agriculture was primarily in its instrumentality in the emergence 
of the new capitalist ecological regime (Marchesi 2020). A century and a 
half later, European rural landscapes, farming practices, and agricultural 
politics are fundamentally shaped and continue to be re-organized ac-
cording to the logics set forth by Liebig ’s (and his contemporaries ’) early 
theories on soil and agricultural productivity, as well as the general 
separateness of soils from society. The very normality people in Europe 
know in landscapes and farming practices is thus a product of histori -
cally particular conceptions of what soils are, and which serve particular 
interests. 
It is however important to mention that the ontological foundation of 
the treatment of soils in modern industrial farming cannot be reduced 
merely to the description presented above. Similarly, the origins of the 
exploitation of soils cannot be pinpointed to the 1850s alone8 (or at any 
other moment in time for that matter), as there are many examples of 
agricultural practices that depleted soils across the world well before 
industrialization (Hillel 1992 ) or the origins of capitalism (whether one 
traces those origins to the 1800s or to the long-16th century; see Moore 
2015 ). The primary significance of studying the changes in agricultural 
practices and treatment of soils since the start of industrialization and 
especially after the World Wars, however, is that both mark a boundary 
moment of clear intensification of a process where exploitation and extraction of soils became systemically driven and radically expanded. 
This indicates a shift from practices of exploitation and degradation to a 
system based on extraction of soils multispecies life, with its specific re-
lations of power and politics (thus denoting a wider extractiv ism). The 
important point therefore is not whether unsustainable ways of relating 
to soils have previously existed, but rather that the specific (European) 
ontologics which reduced soils to mere dirt or to their productive ca-
pacity became institutionalized into political and economic practices 
and policies across continents and were operationalized for the benefit 
of state-projects,9 capital accumulation, economic growth, and moder -
nity. This emphasis is important because it enables thinking with the 
underlying ontological drivers (i.e. imaginaries) of societal processes 
and practices, while avoiding treating those imaginaries as 
determinants. 
3.Mining soils: effects of industrial agriculture in Europe 
In the previous section, I presented the specific soil ontologies behind 
industrial agriculture and discussed the historical foundations of a 
mechanistic and chemical understanding of soils, as presented by 
Marchesi (2020) and Krzywoszynska and Marchesi (2020). In this sec-
tion, I aim to demonstrate how these particular understandings of soils, 
which posit them as a passive medium for growing crops, physically 
manifest themselves in modern industrial agriculture and rural land-
scapes in Europe. 
European landscapes are shaped by agriculture, which has been 
practiced on the continent for millennia, with approximately 40 percent 
of Europe ’s land currently used for agriculture (EUROSTAT 2021c ). 
Agricultural production in Europe has undergone significant changes 
both structurally and in relation to rural livelihoods and multispecies 
existence. A wide variety of studies show that especially during the last 
hundred years European farmland and European landscapes have 
experienced massive changes (Pardo et al., 2020 ). During this time, 
agricultural land use has intensified both locally and on a landscape 
level. Local intensification has entailed the increased use of chemicals 
and fertilizers, higher cropping intensity, and the overall mechanization 
of farming operations (Pardo et al., 2020 ). On a landscape level, this 
intensification has meant regional specialization of agricultural pro-
duction and the expansion of monocultures (meaning only one crop 
species is farmed on one field in one year, and often year after year), 
consolidation of small fields into larger ones, and the simplification of 
farmlands in general (Kallio 2022 ; Concepci ˘on et al., 2008 ; Pa¯sakarnis 
and Maliene 2010 ; Jongman, 2002 ). This simplification is the result of 
eliminating rotational and cover crop farming, as well as the elimination 
of landscape elements and habitats in farmlands, such as field margins, 
ponds, streams, hedges, trees, or grassland in order to facilitate the use 
of modern machinery and expand production (Pardo et al., 2020 ; Aviron 
et al., 2018 ; Concepci ˘on et al., 2020 ; ¯S˘alek et al., 2018 ). A large part of 
these major changes in agricultural operations and rural landscapes 
have occurred within three generations and through rapid processes of 
1. mechanization of agriculture, 2. intensification and commercializa -
tion of farming (from family farms to industries), 3. active globalization 
and cheapening of the food market, and 4. farmland abandonment along 
7 The chemicalization and industrialization of agriculture also provided 
personal benefits for Liebig and other agricultural chemists who promoted the 
mineral theory of soils. Liebig, for example, created and patented one of the 
very first synthetic fertilizers, which meant that the increasing influence of his 
mineral theory of soil also greatly contributed to the growth of his personal 
wealth (Saito 2017 : 194).  
8 In fact Liebig himself also attempted to develop his theory of soil fertility to 
prevent soil exhaustion, which resulted from what he called ‘robbery agricul -
ture’ (see Saito 2017 ). However, it could be argued that due to his political 
ontological frame, disregard for the biology of soils, and his non-relational 
understanding of how soils are connected to the wider landscape and multi -
species existence, his ‘solution ’ was misinformed and because of that led to the 
intensification and expansion of agricultural practices that exhaust and poison 
soils. 9 Which includes socialist states. Soil exhaustion and scientific notions on 
soils in the context of socialist states has for example been studied at length by 
Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro (see e.g. 2021 ; 2014; 2006 ; 2002). S. Hokkanen

6with farmland expansion10 (Pardo et al., 2020 ; Kimbrell 2002 ; Clapp 
2023 ). 
Similar changes have also occurred in pastoralism and livestock 
rearing (Le Noe et al., 2018 ). Agricultural modernization has signifi -
cantly decreased the diversity of livestock species and moved animals 
from pastures and grasslands to indoor facilities; meaning that animals 
have been reduced from ‘lively ’ beings within the farming landscape 
(within networks of multispecies existence playing a central role in crop 
production and maintaining soil health) to commodities encased in in-
door factories (Despret and Meuret 2016 ). 
3.1. Effects on soils 
The developments pictured above have had fundamental implica -
tions for the state and health of soils in European farmlands. As dis-
cussed by the soil scientists Kutílek and Nielsen (2015) , many of the 
currently normalized and commonly accepted agricultural practices of 
managing soils are immensely destructive and eventually lead to the 
exhaustion of soils. Montgomery (2007) also argues that soil degrada -
tion in Europe can be primarily attributed to the fundamentals of 
modern industrial agriculture (i.e., the heavy use of machinery, 
mono-cropping, and agrochemicals), which neglect soil fertility, render 
soils ’ own nutrient provision superfluous, and separate crop production 
from animal husbandry (see also Le Noe et al., 2018 ). It has been esti-
mated that each ton of grain produced by industrial agricultural prac-
tices results in several tons of lost topsoil globally (Salazar et al., 2020b ; 
see also footnote).11 
The mechanized industrial form of agriculture currently practiced in 
Europe is heavily based on monocrop cultivation, a system in which 
fields are often stripped bare of their plant cover each year (Krzy-
woszynska 2019 ). This leads to the depletion of microbial life in soils 
and the exhaustion of the nutrients upon which plant growth depends, 
eventually leading to major reductions in yields (or furthering the 
dependence on chemical fertilizers). Even if farmers replace soil’s nu-
trients with mineral fertilizers (which often only means nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium), other required nutrients or substances 
begin to diminish and often disappear (Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ). The 
lack of organic matter and microbial life in soils leads to weakened root 
systems, a reduction of growth in the aboveground plant parts, and the 
overall deterioration of the physical, chemical, and biological properties 
of the soil. Eventually, with continued monotonous monocultural production, coupled with intense plowing, soils lose their structure 
(Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ). Industrial agriculture is thus based on 
stripping the land bare during harvest and essentially mining the soil of 
its nutrients and organic matter (Krzywoszynska 2019 ; Nearing et al., 
2017 ). 
The ‘mining of soils ’ (aptly named by Krzywoszynska [2019: 6]) is 
not the only problem with intensive farming, as monocultures also 
require massive amounts of fertilizers and pesticides, without which 
large-scale industrial farming would not survive (Guthman 2017 ). This 
is because cultivating the same crop on the same field with minimal crop 
rotations will eventually lead to the prevalence of weeds and plant 
diseases as the natural processes of plant protection through biodiversity 
are reduced and eliminated (Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ; Tostado et al., 
2022 ) Consequently, producers are forced to combat ‘unwanted ’ weeds 
and pests with various kinds of pesticides, which might lead to 
short-term successes but eventually create a dependency on pesticides 
(as well as fertilizers). This is aptly described as the ‘pesticide treadmill ’ 
by Bakker et al. (2020) . The heavy use of pesticides has also failed to 
lead to sustained production increases, as pesticide use is increasing 
almost twice as fast as food production (Schreinemachers and Tipraqsa 
2012 ). 
Additionally, even with the most selective use, pesticides will always 
impact and kill vast amounts of other micro and macro soil fauna and 
flora that are beneficial and necessary for soil, plant, and animal health 
(Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ). Pesticides thus alter the very ecology of 
farming systems and end up accumulating in the web-of-life, as some of 
the chemicals used do not decompose but rather continue to move 
through the landscape and bodies. Intensive agricultural practices like 
monocultures thus lead to soils becoming sick and stripped of their 
multispecies life (Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ). Currently, there are almost 
no soils left in Europe which are not contaminated by a cocktail of 
chemicals (EUROSTAT 2021a ). In other words, pesticides are one of the 
prime tools through which producers and agro-chemical companies 
decide which beings are permitted to live or made to die, and for whose 
benefit (Paredes 2022 ). 
In addition to the ecocidal impacts of fertilizer and pesticide use, 
mechanized and monocultural farming has many other effects. For 
example, when soils lose their structure, they become more susceptible 
to packing, erosion, and runoff. To be able to continue farming on 
packed soils, farmers start to rely on heavy tilling, which leads to further 
disturbance of the soil structure, increasing its vulnerability to erosion 
(Kutílek and Nielsen 2015 ). Many of the core practices of modern in-
dustrial farming thus actually result from the need to fix or override 
problems created by the very same system of production, which is driven 
by pressures to intensify and scale up (Weis 2010 ). 
As discussed by de la Bellacasa (2015) , all of these major changes in 
the treatment and health of soils are part of a wider trend in modern 
management centered around a productionist mindset and the maxi-
mization of soil beyond its possible renewal pace. As a result of decades 
of mechanized and chemical-based industrial agriculture, a large part of 
European farmlands has become what Anna Tsing, 2017; Tsing et al., 
2017 : 52) calls industrial landscapes, which “kill off beings that are not 
recognized as assets. ” The effects are also much wider and seep and 
travel beyond the fields and farmlands, which is evident in the massive 
losses of bird and insect populations in Europe as well as in the pollution 
of waterways.12 In Belgium for example, all of the country ’s rivers have 
become so severely polluted by the fertilizer and pesticide use of in-
dustrial agriculture, that in some streams the water itself could be 10Le Noe et al. (2018) provide a brilliant summary of the changes in agri-
cultural land use and nutrient flows in France from the 1850s until the 2010s. 
They show how small-scale integrated crop and livestock farming was the norm 
everywhere in France (as in most of Europe) during the second half of the 
1800s, as production and fertilization completely relied on manure recycling 
and the maintenance of organic content in soils. Although crop specialization, 
the use of new technologies, and chemical fertilizers (fueled, for example, by 
heavy lobbying from fertilizer companies; see Duby and Wallon, 1977 ) began to 
gain traction in the first half of the 20th century, the biggest change occurred 
from 1946 onwards. The decades after the Second World War in France were 
marked by a clear move away from rotational and mixed farming practices, the 
expansion of crop specialization, and, thus, rapid acceleration of a new type of 
agro-food system characterized by monocropping and the heavy use of external 
inputs and machines. The use of synthetic fertilizers began to increase from the 
end of WWII and exploded in the 1960s (Le Noe et al., 2018 ; Bouwman et al., 
2017 ), fundamentally transforming agricultural relations with soil life.  
11 Estimations on annual soil erosion in arable lands vary greatly, as exact 
amounts are difficult to obtain. However, regardless of the exact numbers, most 
estimations show soil erosion to be manifold compared to the amount of crops 
produced; According to the FAO (2022) in 2021 the global production of 
agricultural crops was 9.5 billion metric tons (increasing by 54 percent since 
2000 and 2 percent since 2020), while the annual loss of agricultural soil has 
been estimated to be between 36 billion metric tons (Borrelli et al., 2017 ) and 
75 billion metric tons (FAO 2017 ), amounts which are three to eight times 
larger compared to the amount of crops produced. 12 Additionally, the importance of soil health in non-rural areas is evident in 
soils ’ ability to absorb water and carbon, facilitate pollination, and enable 
microbial resistance. Eroded soils, on the other hand, release carbon and other 
gasses and lose their ability to absorb water. Thus, while healthy, soils 
contribute greatly to resilience against the climate emergency and disasters 
such as floods, eroded soils can accentuate the disaster itself (Payton 2021 ). S. Hokkanen

7classified as pesticide (Casado et al., 2019 ). 
Le Noe et al. (2018: 142) argue that the problems resulting from 
over-fertilization, excess nitrogen in soils, and the overall intensified 
dependence on external chemical inputs (represented, e.g., by the term 
‘metabolic rift’—see Foster, 1999 ; 2000 ) ought to be attributed to “po-
litical choices and modes of insertion within the market economy, rather 
than to endogenous mechanisms in agricultural production itself. ” As 
shown and discussed by a variety of studies (see, e.g., Pardo et al., 2020 ; 
den Herder et al., 2017 ; Henle et al., 2008 ; Klijn 2004 ; Tscharntke et al., 
2005 ; van Vliet et al., 2015 ), all the above-mentioned changes in 
farming practices are actively driven by policy programs such as the 
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which I discuss more explicitly later 
in this article. 
The extractivist form of treating soils in modern industrial farming 
also firmly links agriculture to wider political economic systems of fossil 
capitalism. As argued by researchers such as Montgomery (2007) and 
Weis (2010) , by seemingly disconnecting agricultural production from 
regenerative management of local soil conditions and introducing ma-
chinery, mineral fertilizers, and pesticides, agriculture has become 
dependent on fossil fuels and agrochemical companies.13 The use of 
pesticides and fertilizers is thus necessary for the reproduction of a 
specific type of political economy in agriculture (Shattuck 2021 ). 
Farmers ’ dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides also in-
creases production costs, which often leads to debt relations and paves 
the way for further financialization of rural landscapes and corporati -
zation of agriculture14 (McKay 2018 ; McMichael 2013 ; McKay et al., 
2021 ). 
3.2. State of European soils 
Although soil degradation in Europe is generally recognized as a 
serious threat, its quantification, geographical distribution, and total 
proliferation are only roughly known (European Soil Observatory, 2024 ; 
European Environment Agency, 2020 ) and differences exist between 
countries and regions. Regardless of the uncertainty, most estimations 
indicate that the overall situation is severe and worsening (European 
Soil Observatory, 2024 ; Panagos et al., 2019 ). For instance, a study by 
the European Commission (2020) found that over two thirds (70%) of 
soils in Europe are losing their capacity to maintain plant growth and 
almost half of all soils in the EU contain extremely low levels of organic 
matter (European Environment Agency, 2020 ). Since 2010, more than 
12 million hectares of agricultural land (7.2% of the total area) have 
become severely eroded each year (Panagos et al., 2015 ). On average, 
European landscapes are losing about 2.5 tons of soil per hectare 
(t/ha/year), while about 12.7% of European arable lands are subject to 
soil loss of over 5 t/ha (FAO 2020 ). Erosion is highest in Austria, Spain 
(where loss of soil in agricultural land peaked at an average of 28 
t/ha/year between 1990 and 1995) and elsewhere in the Mediterranean 
region. To put these numbers into context, it has been estimated that 
with the very slow rate of soil formation, any soil loss of more than 1 
t/ha/year can be considered irreversible within a time span of 50–100 
years (European Environment Agency, 2020 : 189). 
In addition to the mechanical erosion of soils, the organic and chemical composition of European soils is being significantly depleted. 
European agricultural soils are currently losing carbon at a rate of 0.5% 
per year, which is equivalent to the carbon emissions of 500 million 
extra cars (European Commission 2020 : 8). Overall, soil moisture in the 
EU decreased over 10% between 2000 and 2019 (Eurostat 2021a ), and 
the vast majority (83%) of EU soils are contaminated with pesticide 
residues that do not decompose (Silva et al., 2019 ). In addition, 65–75% 
of agricultural soils are over-fertilized with external nutrient inputs, 
which is leading to the eutrophication of soils and water. In cities, the 
majority of urban soils are sealed, and only 13% of new infrastructural 
developments occur on recycled land. Other markers show that 23% of 
all arable land suffers from high density soil compaction, and 25% of 
land in Southern Central and Eastern Europe is at high risk of deserti -
fication —an increase of 11% in just 10 years (European Commission 
2020 : 7). 
4.The European Union ’s Common Agricultural Policy as a 
world-maker and a driver of soil abuse 
Farms and agriculture make particular kinds of worlds visible with 
their related structures of power (Campbell 2020 ). Contemporary agri-
cultural politics, industrially organized agriculture, and with them, the 
underlying relations to soils are not simply the outcome of social and 
economic processes under modernity, but rather, as argued by Campbell 
(2020: 14), “they play their own role in enacting the ontology of 
modernity. ” In this section I provide an overview of the general devel -
opment and political structures of industrial agriculture in Europe, and 
of the European Union ’s agricultural policies as processes of establishing 
a specific kind of institutionalized relation to soils. I argue these to be a 
process of world-making, in which certain kinds of worlds and exis-
tences are made at the cost of erasing and extracting others. 
Since its inception, after the agricultural revolution in the 1800s and 
especially post-WWII, industrial-scale agriculture has been a major 
driver of soil loss as well as other related processes, such as species loss, 
landscape degradation, and pollution of waterways (Pardo et al., 2020 ; 
Le Noe et al., 2018 ; Pe’er et al., 2014 , 2019 ). An increasing number of 
studies identify the roots of modern industrial agriculture in 
world-historically dominant systems of production and consumption, 
premised on principles of growth and accumulation, and powered by 
extractivist practices (see Chagnon et al., 2022 ; Clapp et al., 2018 ; 
McKay et al., 2021 ; the world-systemic aspects of agriculture and 
agrarian change are best illustrated by Friedmann and McMichael 
[1989] in their work on global food regimes). Therefore, the type of 
agricultural development and modernization that is now dominant in 
Europe has long roots in the general industrialization of societies and 
dominant ontological understandings that view nature as a passive 
resource separate from humanity. 
The European Union ’s Common Agricultural Policy has long been, in 
all its contradictory features, the main political instrument behind 
agricultural change in Europe and as such a major driver in how rural 
lands and existences have become to be organized across Europe. 
Coupled with technological development and the globalization and 
corporatization of food production, the CAP has promoted structural 
changes in agriculture since its inception —changes that have led to the 
increased intensification, concentration, and specialization of produc -
tion (e.g., monocropping) in some areas and abandonment of rural lands 
in others. The CAP came into force in 1962, following the founding of a 
European Common Market in 1957, with the aim of increasing agri-
cultural productivity in order to improve food security, ensure a better 
standard of living for farmers, and stabilize agricultural markets and 
farmers ’ incomes (Lefebvre et al., 2015 ). However, since its earliest 
reforms, the CAP has mainly functioned as a tool for agricultural 
modernization, corporatization, and export-oriented agribusiness. Ac-
cording to Meeus et al. (1990) , the CAP is among the main driving forces 
of the uniformization of European landscapes (thus also denoting the 
enactment and ecological expansion of the one-world-world [Law 13 Manufacturing synthetic fertilizers is completely reliant on the use of fossil 
fuels and thus extremely energy intensive: Producing 1 kg of nitrogen requires 
the energy equivalent of 2 L of diesel, and for phosphate, 1 kg requires the 
equivalent of 1 L of diesel (Shiva 2008 ). In general, it has been estimated that 
industrial systems of food production use 10 times more energy than, for 
example, what Vandana Shiva calls ‘ecological agriculture, ’ and 10 times more 
energy than the energy in the food that is produced (Weizs acker et al., 1997 in 
Shiva 2008 ). 
14A New York Times article in 2019 argued that the aforementioned de-
velopments driven by the CAP may even signal the emergence of ‘modern 
feudalism ’ in Europe (Gebrekidan, Apuzzo & Novak 2019 ). S. Hokkanen

82015]). As discussed in Lymbery (2017: 86), even the European Com-
mission itself admits that the subsidy system for farmers (one of the two 
main pillars of the CAP) explicitly encourages the intensification of 
farming practices and pressures farmers to adopt the use of modern 
machinery and chemical fertilizers (European Commission 2014 , in 
Lymbery 2017 ). As summarized by Lymbery (2017) , by supporting 
agricultural production and the intensification of farming, the subsidy 
program at the core of the CAP causes farm prices to fall, while the price 
of external inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, continues 
to rise. This encourages farmers to favor production systems that rely on 
economies of scale (i.e., large-scale farms with highly mechanized 
monocrop-systems). Farmers in the EU have thus become trapped in a 
production system that was designed to promote expansion and 
export-oriented production and rendered them completely dependent 
on subsidies. 
From a political ontological perspective, a key aspect in under -
standing the characteristics of any given world and the practices that 
enact it, is the question of who and what is being allowed to exist and 
how. Within industrial agriculture this is extremely limited (Kroger 
2021 ), and manifests for example in the staggering levels and increase of 
monocultural farming and specialized livestock production. Already in 
2016, over half (53 %) of all farms in the EU were specialized in just a 
small number of crop species, and a quarter (24.5 %) of farms only 
reared livestock (Eurostat 2021b ). This specialization means that rural 
landscapes (and therefore Europe in general) are dominated by only a 
few crop species.15 As a whole, mixed farms account for around 20% of 
all farms in the EU, but these farms are often small, as large-scale and 
corporate-style farms tend to specialize either in monocropping or 
livestock rearing. This trend away from mixed farming has only 
increased in recent decades. In conjunction with this change, the total 
number of farms is decreasing, with the exception of the largest farms 
(over 100 ha in size). Between 2005 and 2016, the number of farms in 
the EU decreased by 28% (4.1 million farms). As small-scale farms end 
their operations or go bankrupt, larger owners take over their lands. The 
largest farms (over 100 ha) currently account for 3% of the total number 
of farms but control over half (50.4 %) of the total area used for agri-
cultural production in the EU (Eurostat 2021b ). 
Industrial form of agriculture was however not invented with the 
CAP. The policy program was merely an institutional response and 
manifestation of wider social and political (ontological) changes 
occurring at the end of 19th and beginning of the 20th century, driven 
both by international political economic pressures (e.g., trade liber-
alization) and the state interests of European countries in the post-war 
period. As shown by Le Noe et al. (2018) , many drivers of a more 
extractivist form of agriculture can be understood by the state of na-
tional economies in the post-war context. After the Second World War, 
many European countries relied on international credit, with national 
economies running budget-deficits (Le Noe et al., 2018 ). To strengthen 
their economies, countries began to implement policies to increase 
agricultural and industrial production for the international market. As 
further argued by Le Noe et al. (2018) , post-war policies and aid pack-
ages, such as the Marshall Plan, were extremely significant in this pro-
cess, as they explicitly promoted structural changes that relied upon 
improving labor productivity, freeing labor for industry, and orienting 
production toward export. Additionally, the increasing competition 
created by trade liberalization, the pressure to increase production for economic growth, and the overall push for modernization were the main 
factors that ultimately caused farmers across Europe to adopt agricul -
tural practices that would eventually lead to wide-scale soil degradation 
(Le Noe et al., 2018 ; Gonz ˘alez de Molina et al. 2020 ). In countries such 
as France, this was additionally driven by agricultural propaganda and 
strengthened by laws that restricted people ’s access to land, thus rein-
forcing competition between farmers, who were eventually forced to 
modernize to survive (Le Noe et al., 2018 ). 
These world-making and life-altering processes of specialization, 
expansion, and intensification were Gonz ˘alez de Molina, Manuel et al., 
2020 further cemented in European agricultural production and rural 
landscapes from the 1970s onwards, as the neoliberalization of eco-
nomic politics facilitated land consolidations, thus supporting 
large-scale production-modes and the emergence of the corporatization 
of agriculture. In many countries, the period from the 1970s until the 
2010s was characterized by the continued and intensifying specializa -
tion of crop production systems and the emergence of intensive livestock 
farming, namely factory farms (Le Noe et al., 2018 ; Einarsson et al., 
2021 ). On the EU-level, this was driven by the so-called ‘Mansholt plan, ’ 
a reform in the CAP that aimed at wide-scale modernization of the 
agricultural sector by ‘optimizing ’ the area of land under cultivation (i.e. 
to promote monocropping) and by merging farms to create larger units 
(Council of the European Union, 2022a ). As a result of the reform, the 
CAP shifted from direct price support to the provision of subsidies 
indexed on the cultivated area and herd size (Le Noe et al., 2018 ). The 
Mansholt plan further heightened the regional specialization of farming 
(i.e., certain areas specialized in certain crops and crop cultivation 
became further separated from livestock rearing), which again increased 
the dependence on the external inputs of fertilizers and pesticides. The 
same process is also evident in the newer member states of Eastern 
Europe, mirroring the longer established trend within older member 
states in the speed and profundity with which the CAP remakes rural 
existences and alters the countryside, with detrimental effects on the 
diversity and locality of food production, and the loss of diversity in 
other-than-human lifeworlds (Reif and Vermouzek, 2019 ; Sz˘ep et al., 
2014 ; Lymbery 2017 ). 
The abovementioned changes occurred in conjunction with other 
economic policies aimed at promoting production efficiency and market 
liberalism, which, according to the political narratives of that time, were 
thought to equip farmers with the necessary tools for international 
competition (Bureau and Thoyer 2014 ). The Mansholt plan and the 
subsequent reforms of the CAP thus also reinforced the integration of 
agriculture into the market economy (Le Noe et al., 2018 ), transforming 
the lived worlds of farms by bringing in a new relational frame in which 
to function. 
As previously discussed, the specific chemical-based understanding 
of soils (which ontologically posits them as inert) and the operational 
basis it provided for industrializing nations at the end of 1800s were 
established institutionally from the 1940s onwards to serve moderni -
zation and states ’ economic recuperation after the World Wars, as well 
as to provide new outlets for the mineral and machine industry that 
emerged during war-time and free labor for industrial development (Le 
Noe et al., 2018 ). Building on this, the CAP thus represents the legally 
and politically established institutionalization of processes and changes 
in agriculture that had already begun to emerge in Europe. To continue, 
the politically dominant notion of soils that enabled the emergence of 
industrial agriculture is therefore inextricably encoded by the logics of 
contemporary state-politics and narratives of modernity (Tironi et al., 
2020 ; Engel-Di Mauro 2002 ; Van Sant, 2021 ), making industrial agri-
cultural politics a central driver of how modernity and capitalism 
materially make, re-make and unmake the lived worlds of both humans 
and other-than-human life. 
Furthermore, to understand the political ontological nature of how 
soils are treated and understood in industrial agricultural politics it is 
useful to note that increasing environmental and biodiversity consid -
erations have not been able to challenge the productivism at the root of 15 The majority of all crop production in Europe is cereal farming, and, of 
cereal farming, 67% (in 2019) consists of only wheat and grain maize (Eurostat 
2021a ). Wheat accounts for close to half of the total quantity of cereals grown 
across the EU each year. The remainder is principally composed of grain maize 
and corn-cob mix and barley, with smaller quantities of other cereals, such as 
rye and oats. Moreover, the majority of cereals consumed in the EU (in 2019) 
are used for animal feed, with only 30% of cereals going to human consumption 
(Eurostat 2021b ). S. Hokkanen

9agricultural soil relations. Although soils and other ‘environmental 
considerations ’ have gained attention within the CAP, especially in the 
2000s (Council of the European Union, 2022b ), there are no binding or 
overarching policies for soil protection on the EU level (Heuser 2022 ). 
The existing environmental regulations and ‘greening ’ measures remain 
strongly subsumed under the logic of productivism, and have mainly 
been adopted because they enable the continuation of current modes of 
production (de la Bellacasa 2017; Levidow 2015 ). 
Building on the aforementioned sections, I argue, that the modern 
industrial food system (or the ‘corporate food regime ’; see McMichael 
2005 ) is a manifestation of modernity as a way of organizing the world 
through its specific relations to soils, land and other-than-human life. 
The dominance of this political ontological power in organizing life and 
landscapes is also characterized by the lack of choice that farmers face. 
While most farmers in Europe are not drivers of agrarian capitalism or 
do not necessarily aim to practice extractivist relations to soils, the 
operational framework in which they are forced to function is shaped 
and determined by the principles of modern industrial agriculture and 
powerful agribusiness actors. Large farms currently control most of the 
arable land in the EU, and, as argued by Wendy Wolford (2021) , 
large-scale commodity production thus shapes the conditions of most 
producers —irrespective of whether they participate in, reject, or even 
resist the form of farming which is degrading soils and landscapes. This 
is representative of the how industrial and extractivist forms of 
world-making function by denying and erasing the possibility of other 
ways of being in the world (as discussed in e.g. Kroger 2021 ). 
The small-scale farm bankruptcies, land consolidations, simplifica -
tion of rural landscapes, and specialization and re-organization of farm 
production for export witnessed in Europe can be seen as manifestations 
of the effects of extractivist forms of agriculture on the social fabric and 
agricultural community configurations. Similar to the imposition of 
plantations around the Global South discussed by Wolford (2021) 
(although on a different scale and intensity), the more gradual imposi -
tion of mechanized industrial farming in Europe is also predicated on the 
mining of life for profit, the removal of pre-existing community ties, and 
the reconfiguration of rural lifeways around commodity production. In 
this section I have shown how industrial agriculture ’s relations to soils 
contribute to making certain kinds of worlds at the cost of erasing others. 
In the next section I further elaborate on the concept of soil extractivism 
as an effort to make sense of and to describe a part of industrial agri-
culture ’s world-making, as it occurs through politically institutionalized 
relations towards soils. 
5.Theoretical contribution: Soil extractivism 
Extractivism, as a concept, is rooted in the history of extensive nat-
ural resource extraction fueled by colonial structures of power (Chagnon 
et al., 2022 ). As an academic discourse, extractivism has its origins in 
Latin American political economy and political ecology and is 
commonly used to refer to a mode of economic production in which 
‘natural resources ’ are removed in large quantities and used as raw 
materials for industrial processes elsewhere (Szeman and Wenzel 2021 ). 
Conceptually, extractivism has seen various definitions and emphases, 
and its’ world-systemic significance continues to be expanded upon and 
explored (see Chagnon et al., 2022 for a review). However, the majority 
of existing literature on extractivism tends to address soils only in the 
context of their contamination by extractivist practices, such as mines. 
Soils are thus viewed merely as a realm in which negative environmental 
effects appear rather than a thing to be extracted in itself. 
Agro-extractivism has been recognized as a key manifestation of 
extractivism by numerous scholars (Acosta, 2013 ; Svampa 2013 ; 
Chagnon et al., 2022 ; McKay et al., 2021 ). Many case studies on 
agro-extractivism focus on the Global South and on a form of agriculture 
that Gudynas (2010) , for example, argues is characterized by mono -
culture plantations, the use of transgenic crop species, heavy mechani -
zation, and the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and is aimed at commodity production for export markets. In addition, as discussed in 
Chagnon et al. (2022) , research on extractivist modes of agriculture also 
emphasizes its’ connections to land-grabbing (Borras et al., 2012 ), class 
struggle (Bernstein 2010 ), and myriad socio-environmental harms 
(Alonso-Fradejas 2018 ; C˘aceres 2015 ). Furthermore, agro-extractivism 
(like all forms of extractivism) should always be understood in the 
context of its wider operational logic (McKay et al., 2021 ) and as a 
specific way of organizing the world (Chagnon et al., 2022 ). According 
to McKay et al. (2021: 8), agro-extractivist practices fundamentally 
operate on a logic which “undermines the very material bases for which 
their reproduction and value appropriation depends. ” They continue by 
saying that agro-extractivism thus leads to soil exhaustion, ecological 
destruction, rural out-migration, and catastrophic impacts for multi -
species life, including humans (McKay et al., 2021 ). Therefore, beyond 
its ‘apparent features ’ (McKay et al., 2021 ), extractivism is not simply a 
political project, a feature of an economic system, or even a set of 
practices; rather, and more fundamentally, it is a way of organizing life 
(including land, bodies, relations, and labor —both human and 
other-than-human) and one of the main ways capitalism and modernity 
materially manifest themselves in the world today. 
Based on the aforementioned logic, dynamics, and operational 
principles of industrial agriculture, I propose a definition of soil extrac -
tivism as practices and operations aimed at profit production and capital 
accumulation that deplete and violently re-organize soils ’ multispecies 
life. Soil extractivism is thus a description of a process and set of prac-
tices where the multispecies life and minerals of the soil are exploited 
and depleted in a non-regenerative way to produce crops that are treated 
as commodities. At the same time, due to its foundational core of violent 
and systemic depletion and re-organization of multispecies life and 
landscape, soil extractivism also constitutes a way of organizing life, 
similarly to all forms of extractivism (Chagnon et al., 2022 ). Under 
extractivist practices and logic, soils are thus assigned a rigid role and 
forced to labor until exhaustion (Lyons 2020 ). To further characterize 
and define soil extractivism, I offer the following criteria which, in 
conjunction with the aforementioned description, constitute the term. 
Materially soil extractivism thus refers to practices and ways of relating 
to soils that  
≡continuously strip soils bare of plant cover,  
≡deplete soils nutrients and microbial life, significantly reducing the 
amount and diversity of different lifeforms in the soil, 
≡by-pass or make redundant the soils ’ own multispecies base in pro-
ducing plant growth, for example through the heavy use of chemical 
and synthetic fertilizers or pesticides to which the system becomes 
dependent on 
≡pay no or extremely limited attention to the regeneration or main -
tenance of soil, apart from adding substances that are assumed to 
directly contribute to the growth of cultivated crops,  
≡are based on high cropping intensity, heavy tilling, and disturbance 
of soil structure,  
≡produce barren or polluted soils which make it impossible or difficult 
for other agricultural operations to cultivate the soil, even when 
extractivist activities are discontinued (here lending from Kroger ’s 
[2021] general characteristics of extractivisms). 
In order to situate the concept further, although soil extractivism is a 
subset of agro-extractivism, and all agro-extractivisms deplete soils, 
these two terms cannot be conceptually equated. This is because, even if 
the other core characteristics of agro-extractivisms (such as plantation- 
sized fields, labor exploitation, dispossession of lands, deforestation, 
production for exports [McKay et al., 2021 ]) were absent, soil extrac -
tivism can and does also occur in less obviously unsustainable agricul -
tural practices (such as wheat production in Europe). As examinations of 
agro-extractivism often focus on plantation-sized monocultural farming, 
they miss the issue that extractivist forms of (ab)using and re-organizing 
soils can and do occur in small- or medium-scale settings where farmers S. Hokkanen

10practice normalized forms of industrial agricultural practices, such as 
use of heavy-machinery, high cropping intensity, and the extensive use 
of external inputs. Nonetheless, soil extractivism should also not be 
equated with all forms of soil degradation and contamination. Beyond 
the apparent features of agro-extractivism, soil extractivism focuses on 
the type of relation with soil through which soils are mined of their nu-
trients and organic mass (i.e., life); making extractivism the modus 
operandi , not a symptom or a result. Thus far, only a small number of 
contributions have explicitly used the term soil extractivism in the 
extractivism literature. Kroger and Ehrnstr om-Fuentes, 2021 : 203), for 
example, characterize forestry extractivism (as a subset of 
agro-extractivism) through “soil, water, and carbon extractivism ” due to 
its destructive impact on these realms. Theoretically, the concept of soil 
extractivism builds on some recent (and divergent) contributions to 
extractivism, such as Kroger ’s (2021) work on the political economy of 
existences, which examines the existential redistributions and extinc -
tions produced by monoculture plantations in Brazil. Another example is 
Alonso-Fradejas ’ (2020: 140) research on predatory agrarian extracti -
vism in Guatemala, which he characterizes as “life-purging, ” as it 
manufactures environmentally and socially toxic landscapes. These 
contributions, along with an increasing amount of brilliant conceptual 
work within anthropology and indigenous, feminist, and decolonial 
studies (Tsing et al., 2017 ; Vindal Ødegaard et al., 2019 ; de la Bellacasa 
2017; Grosfoguel, 2020 ; see also Chagnon et al., 2022 ), facilitate a shift 
in understanding extractivism and capitalist appropriation of both the 
material and intangible world(s) as commodification of life in general 
(Lyons 2020 ), from which concepts such as ‘soil extractivism ’ are able to 
arise. 
By naming the destruction of soils done by industrial agriculture as 
extractivism, (rather than for example degradation or exploitation), 
emphasis is put on both the materiality of production and value creation, 
as well as on the agency and power politics of the activities. The ma-
teriality of production and value creation refers to an understanding that 
value is extracted or harvested from something (in this case, the multi -
species life of soils), rather than created or produced. Additionally, by 
focusing on the agency and the power politics that are necessary for 
extractivism to occur, the conceptual foci differ from analyses which 
examine soil degradation as merely a result of agricultural or social 
practices. Conceptually, extractivism thus always includes a more cen-
tral focus and an acknowledgement of agency in extractivist operations, 
and power asymmetries within these relations. Importantly, extracti -
vism does not therefore just ‘happen ’ amidst other activities but is the 
main purpose of the activity . 
By examining soil extractivism through a political ontological lens 
one is also able to understand the erasure that ensues from extractivism 
as erasure of existences (and not just a decrease of passive resources or 
elimination of things). Additionally, soil extractivism as a political 
ontological (i.e. world-making) process does not just erase soils multi -
species life, but also re-organizes existences of the remaining beings (as 
discussed for example in Kroger [2021] in the case of increased prolif -
eration of pests), creates new simplified ecologies, and as such de-
termines new conditions for what kinds of lives and lifeways are possible 
and which are not (for both human and other-than-human). This does 
not however mean that all re-organizations of soil ecologies are 
extractivist, as all farming practices modify and rearrange soil life to 
some extent. 
In addition, what this means for wider theocratizations on extracti -
visms is that the concept of soil extractivism enables examination of 
extractivisms which do not only stem from certain historical dynamics 
between the Global North and South or other colonial political economic 
power structures. Soil extractivism arises from, and speaks to, a wider 
understanding of coloniality as not only a monolithic structure of his-
torical imperialism and state-relations, but also “a set of contemporary 
and evolving land relations that can be maintained by good intentions ” 
or presumed best-practices (Liboiron, 2021 : 6). Soil extractivism thus 
denotes a profound ontological logic and way of organizing the web-of-life and acknowledges that there are different levels of extrac -
tivism (as discussed in depth by Kroger 2021 ) as well as different levels 
of visibility of the effects of extractivist practices. 
Soil extractivism is also at the very foundation of modern industrial 
social organization, although it has remained an unnamed footnote in 
political economic and agrarian studies analyses related to capitalist 
agriculture. For instance, Friedmann and McMichael (1989) discuss 
capitalist development through the concept of ‘food regimes. ’ They, 
along with Bauerly (2017) , argue that the standard model of agriculture 
which has been reliant on mechanization and chemical inputs from early 
on, arose from colonial land relations and the idea of harnessing land for 
state- and industry-building after WWII (as already discussed in the case 
of European Union ’s early agricultural politics). This subsequently set 
the stage for contemporary global extractivist agriculture (Chagnon 
et al., 2022 ). Soil extractivism (although not named as such) thus began 
to globalize and intensify due to specific geopolitical and economic 
projects. Later on, with the neoliberal turn in the 1980s, agriculture 
became increasingly dictated by corporate capital, thus marking the 
shift towards what McMichael (2005) calls the corporate food regime, 
which strongly characterizes the current moment in agricultural soil 
relations. 
As with all forms of extractivism, soil extractivism cannot be 
uncoupled from the political ontological relations that cheapen and 
marginalize that which is being extracted. Extractivism, as one of the 
globally and historically established engines of capital accumulation, is 
founded on the exploitation of unaccounted, cheap nature and labor 
(Moore 2015 ) in which capital and economic growth are produced 
through the lives and bodies of other-than-human beings (Krzy-
woszynska 2020 ). Through extraction and depletion of nutrients and 
organic matter, soils, land, and plant, fungal, and microbial life become 
not just commodified but re-organized in the service of capital accu-
mulation. As Lyons (2020: 52, italics added) argues, it is the “injection of 
capital into the soil, the so-called permanent improvements that change 
the physical characteristics, chemical properties, and biological life of 
soil, that converts soil into a laboring body deemed capable of being 
worked overtime, exhausted and continuously resuscitated through 
chemical input substitution. ” Through this ‘injection, ’ landscapes and 
soil ecologies are transformed to uphold and intensify current dynamics 
of capital reproduction. Therefore, as summarized by De la Bellacasa 
2020a : 100), “agricultural intensification is not only a quantitative 
orientation —yield increase —but also a way of life, and a qualitative 
mode of conceiving relations to the soil”, thus denoting the enactment of 
an ontology. 
Soil extractivism is also characterized by the massive scale and in-
tensity in which microbial, fungal, and plant deaths (resulting from, for 
example, pesticides) begin to occupy lively bodies and lively landscapes, 
such as waterways (building on Rose 2011 ). All soil is the result of be-
ings “living and dying within the soil” (Krzywoszynska 2019 : 668), but 
one of the core tenets of soil extractivism is a type of destruction of 
multispecies life in which dead matter and dead bodies do not ‘turn back 
into life,’ but rather begin to expand and pile up in the web-of-life as 
waste, as discussed by Rose (2011) and Van Dooren, 2014 ) in their work 
on extinctions. In the same vein, Chao and Kirksey (2022) argue that 
industrial processes (including industrial agriculture) systematically 
uncouple life from death and by doing that diminish “death ’s capacity to 
channel vitality back to the living. ” 
From a political ontological point of view, as discussed for example 
in Chagnon et al. (2022) extractivism is thus a mode of organizing life 
that does not allow for multiple worlds to co-exist. In the same vein, S. Hokkanen

11Kroger (2021) refers to extractivisms as a form of ontological occupation 
of territories. Reflecting on industrial agriculture through the concept of 
soil extractivism as ontological occupation also allows one to better 
understand the role of invisibility and gradualness of the destruction. 
The current capitalist world-system manifests itself extremely violently 
in the Global South, creating toxic landscapes and fragmented assem -
blages of life16 (Alonso-Fradejas 2020 ; Wolford 2021 ). However, a 
similar process of manufacturing environmentally and socially toxic 
landscapes is also present in Europe, albeit in a ‘stealthier ’ manner, with 
related contestations and conflicts often not framed as ontological. 
In Europe, the violence towards other-than-human life is almost 
banal in its relatively slow accumulation. This slower, more inconspic -
uous, and gradually produced destruction of soils and rural landscapes 
thus also works to normalize the process itself, as this violent degrada -
tion occurs ‘under the radar ’ and is seen as correct and efficient kind of 
farming and land governance. This also further legitimizes the EU’s 
colonial relations in agricultural trade elsewhere (as seen in the ‘Green 
Revolution ’, see, e.g., Patel 2013 ; Hetherington 2020 ). The gradual 
degradation of life through soil extractivism thus resonates powerfully 
with Rob Nixon ’s idea of ‘slow violence, ’ which is made mundane 
through its repeated exposure and representation (Laurie and Shaw 
2018 ; Parks 2021 ). The mining of soils and gradual contamination of 
land, bodies, and water thus create new conditions for normality, in 
which daily lives are permeated by unseen deadliness and emptiness of 
multispecies loss. 
6.Conclusions 
The soil is the great connector of lives, the source and destination of all. It 
is the healer and restorer and resurrector, by which disease passes into 
health, age into youth, death into life. Without proper care for it we can 
have no community, because without proper care for it, we can have no 
life. (Wendell Berry, 1977 ) 
This article discusses how certain ways of relating to soils produce 
and enable specific kinds of agricultural policies, economic practices and 
ways of being in the world. I described how mechanistic, and non- 
relational soil ontologies have become institutionalized into physical 
landscapes and normalized practices that can be called upon with con-
cepts such as soil extractivism. 
As discussed by (De la Bellacasa (2020c ), in the past 15 years, there 
has been a major resurgence of a more general understanding of soils as 
living. However, due to decades of intense industrial agricultural and 
other similar land practices, the imaginary of soils as a chemical, passive 
medium for plant growth has already become operationalized into 
physical landscapes and normalized into an extractivist form of relating 
to soils. A core characteristic of the thinking of how the world works at 
the foundation of modern industrial agriculture and agricultural politics 
is the reduction of the world to a simplified form of itself, of soils into 
dirt, of landscapes into passive areas, of farming into the production of 
things. The continued abuse of soils, even in times of growing attention 
to their aliveness, is indicative of how the issue of caring for soils is not 
just epistemic but ontological. While the increasing scientific and tech-
nological knowledge is crucial in bringing attention on soils in the po-
litical sphere, conventional techno-scientific conceptions alone are 
unable to reconfigure the current dominant extractivist soil-relations (de 
la Bellacasa 2020a). Thus, thinking with de la Bellacasa (2020c) and 
Mies and Shiva (2014) , sustainable and more just relations can be 
fostered only through alternative conceptual, ethical, and ontological ‘re-tellings ’ of soils. 
Paying attention to soils and operationalizing more caring relations 
with them is extremely urgent, as the destruction of soils and soil health 
has fundamental implications for all societal life. Modernity is built on 
the institutionalized extraction of soils and other(ed) life. The on-going 
systemic degradation of soil ecosystems through chemical pollution, 
erosion, salinization, sealing, and loss of organic matter are represen -
tative of historically institutionalized disjunctures in the organization of 
societal life in relation to the wider web-of-life. The industrial revolu -
tion, the current scale of urbanization, and the modern organization of 
societies hinge upon the industrial and intensive forms of agriculture 
that emerged in the 1800s. Because this form of agriculture is currently 
coming to an end, the mode of societal life built upon it will also face 
foundational changes (or endings). The question of soil degradation is 
therefore not just a question of agriculture but rather how our envi-
ronments and surroundings are organized in general. This is also evident 
in the lived environments of European cities, which are built to insulate 
people from soil and its multispecies life (Tironi et al., 2020 ). The 
extraction, depletion, sealing, and pollution of soils discussed in this 
article are perfect examples of ‘everyday ecocide ’ disguised as 
normality, where “bodies of dead others litter our everyday life” (Rigby 
and Jones 2022 : 112). 
This article offers a historically and materially situated analysis of 
the ruptured relations between the currently dominant ways of orga-
nizing soil life and their multispecies foundation. The article provides 
conceptual and theoretical vocabularies for understanding extractivist 
modes of death- and world-making that are sedimented in landscapes, 
normalized into social imaginaries, and institutionalized into political 
structures. Soil extractivism provides a way to conceptualize and better 
understand the destructions occurring in non-frontier areas of the 
capitalist world-system and in places where agro-extractivism, as it is 
currently understood, might be lacking or not fitting. Soil extractivism 
uncovers the pervasiveness of extractive-based forms of death and 
destruction and shows how capitalist growth and modernity are pre-
mised on ecocide everywhere. Additionally, as a conceptual tool and a 
theoretical contribution, it indicates that more just and sustainable ways 
of treating and relating to soils inescapably require attention to relations 
of power and capital accumulation. 
Considering soils through a political ontological lens enables the 
disruption of dominant categories and modern temporal divides be-
tween past, present, and future. Soils are the co-laborers and hosts of all 
earthly lifeways. They are both a “life sustainer, evolving body, a grave, 
and trash dump ” (Lyons 2020 : 62–63). As shown in this article through 
an analysis of the effects of the CAP, soils and landscapes become ‘living 
archives ’ (following de la Bellacasa 2020b) for different 
socio-ecological, political, and economic histories. Thus, thinking with 
different understandings of soils can potentially create ontological 
openings and facilitate a shared sense of belonging with 
other-than-human life (de la Bellacasa 2017). Soil extractivism also 
enables the realization that modernity, capitalism and the concurrent 
global crises are fundamentally based on the extraction and depletion of 
the invisible and unaccounted. 
While the degraded state of soils reflects the systemic abuse and 
neglect of extractivist ways of being, these dominant modes of relating 
to soils are not the only ones. A plethora of long-established examples 
exist of sustainable and caring soil relations, from different indigenous 
farming and land practices to other forms of regenerative agriculture 
practiced by many small-scale farmers and peasant communities (see, e. 
g., Kimmerer 2013 ; Lyons 2020 ; Gonzalez and Kroger 2020 ; Nabhan 
2018 ). These ways of being with soils along with the everyday practices 
of planting, growing, restoring and composting are examples of how 
soils are being remade and cared for outside of extractivist forms of 
world-making (Salazar et al., 2020a ). While the global degradation of 
soils signals the horrifying depth of the current global crises and the 
consequent implications for all life, working and living with soils opens 
ways out of them. 16 This violence manifests itself, for example, in environmental ‘sacrifice 
zones, ’ murders of indigenous and environmental protectors, wide-scale 
pollution and poisoning of bodies, lands, and waterways, and in the overall 
degradation of people ’s access and right to land (see, e.g., Oliveira and Hecht 
2016 ; Klein 2014 ; Global Witness 2021 ). S. Hokkanen
