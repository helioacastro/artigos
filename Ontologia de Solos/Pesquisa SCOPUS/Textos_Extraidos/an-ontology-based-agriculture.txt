Semantic-webEﬀective  management  of plant diseases  and pests requires  knowledge  that covers multiple  domains.  At the same 
time, retrieving  the relevant  information  in a timely manner  is always  challenging,  due to the unstructured  
nature of agricultural  data. Over the years, eﬀorts have been made to develop  an ontology-based  Decision-
Support  System  (DSS) to facilitate  the diagnosis  and control  of plant diseases.  Some major issues with these 
systems  are that: (1) they do not adopt the full extent of the ontological  constructs  to represent  domain  entities,  
which,  in turn, reduces  reasoning  capabilities  and prevents  systems  from being more intelligent,  (2) they do not 
adequately  provide  the desired  level of knowledge  to support  complex  decisions,  which requires  many factors  to 
be considered,  (3) they do not adequately  explain  or provide  evidence  to demonstrate  the validity  of the system’s  
outputs.  To address  these limitations,  we present  a novel system  termed  Agriculture  Ontology  Based Decision  
Support  System  (AgrODSS),  which aims to assist in plant disease  and pest identiﬁcation  and control.  AgrODSS  
architecture  consists  of two semantic-based  models.  First, we developed  Plant Diseases  and Pests Ontology  (PDP-
O) to capture,  model,  and represent  diseases  and pest knowledge  in a machine-understandable  format.  Second,  
we designed  and developed  an Evidence-Based  Explanation  Model (EBEM)  that points to related  evidence  from 
the literature  to demonstrate  the validity  of the system  outputs.  We demonstrate  the eﬀectiveness  of AgrODSS  
by executing  various  queries  via AgrODSS  SPARQL  Endpoint  and obtaining  valuable  information  to support  
decision-making.  Finally,  we evaluated  AgrODSS  practically  with domain  experts  (including  entomologists  and 
pathologists)  and it produced  similar  answers  to those given by the experts,  with an overall  accuracy  of 80.66%.  
These results demonstrate  AgrODSS’s  ability to assist agricultural  stakeholders  in making  proper  disease  or pest 
diagnoses  and choosing  the appropriate  control  methods.
1. Introduction
Agricultural  production  is constantly  threatened  by various  diseases  
and pests that aﬀect crops,  leading  to signiﬁcant  economic  losses and 
raising  concerns  about food security  [1–4]. In 2021, it was estimated  
that up to 40% of global  crop yield is lost annually  due to pests [5]. Pro-
tecting  crops is challenging,  as a wide range of pests, including  insects,  
plant pathogens,  and weeds,  can cause damage  [6]. Additionally,  agri-
cultural  operations  rely on interconnected  knowledge  from various  do-
mains,  requiring  the consideration  of multiple  factors  to make informed  
decisions  [7]. However,  knowledge  about plant diseases  and pests is of-
ten published  in heterogeneous,  human-oriented  formats,  making  the

context,  transforming  such knowledge  into semantically  computable  re-
sources  has become  a pressing  need, as it ensures  seamless  accessibility  
for decision-makers  and facilitates  eﬃcient  processing  by computers.
Ontology-based  knowledge  representation  emerged  as an outstand-
ing approach  that can revolutionize  agriculture,  allowing  the integration  
and coordination  of large amounts  of agricultural  information  from var-
ious sources  and enabling  semantic  interoperability  between  diﬀerent  
information  systems  [8,9]. Many ontology-based  systems  and applica-
tions have been developed  in agriculture  to manage  and control  plant 
pests and diseases  eﬀectively  [10–13]. Ontologies  are the pillars  of Se-
mantic  Web Technologies  (SWTs).  They provide  an explicit  speciﬁcation

of concepts  within  a given domain  [14]. An ontology  is an approach  for 
representing  real-world  objects  or concepts  as symbols  within  a struc-
tured semantic  model.  In SWTs,  concepts  are referred  to as classes,  
while relationships  between  these concepts  are deﬁned  as properties.  
The logical  formalisms  behind  the ontological  models  give machines  a 
human-like  commonsense  in problem-solving  and allow the inference  
of new knowledge  from existing  knowledge.  The ﬂexibility  and rea-
soning  capabilities  make ontologies  a powerful  alternative  to relational  
databases,  which  demand  manual  creation  of every link, making  them 
more diﬃcult  to manage  as knowledge  expands.
This article  delves  into how ontology-based  decision  support  systems  
can assist in plant disease  and pest identiﬁcation  and control.  However,  
the identiﬁcation  of plant diseases  and pests is a complex  decision  and 
knowledge-handling  problem.  Multiple  factors  aﬀect this decision,  rang-
ing from environmental  conditions  to biological  causes  [6]. The sheer 
volume  of information  available  on these factors  is overwhelming  and is 
usually  scattered  among  several  heterogeneous  data sources  [15]. This 
is where  an ontology-based  system  comes  into play due to its ability  
to integrate  and coordinate  large amounts  of agricultural  information  
emerging  from various  sources  and in diﬀerent  formats.  However,  for 
those systems  to function  eﬀectively,  they need to provide  the desired  
level of knowledge  to support  complex  decisions.  In addition,  decision-
makers  need to trust and understand  the rationale  behind  a system’s  
outputs  so that they can use them in a particular  situation  [16]. This can 
be achieved  by providing  an explanation  or evidence  to demonstrate  the 
validity  of system  outputs.  Evidence  is any information  item or data re-
lated to some matter  that must be proven  or refuted,  it is data used to 
support  statements  [17]. This article  presents  an Agriculture  Ontology-
Based Decision  Support  System  (AgrODSS)  to assist in plant disease  and 
pest identiﬁcation  and control.  It works  to extract,  process,  and pro-
duce machine-understandable  information  to enable  knowledge-driven  
decision-making  in agriculture.  The main contributions  of this work can 
be summarized  as follows:
•D e s i g n  and develop  a novel system  called  the Agriculture  Ontology-
Based Decision  Support  System  (AgrODSS)  to support  agricultural  
decision-making,  particularly  in plant disease  and pest identiﬁca-
tion and control.  (The novelty  of this system  lies in its architecture,  
which consists  of two semantic-based  models  that support  the genera-
tion of inferences  and recommendations.)
•D e s i g n  and development  of Plant Disease  and Pest Ontology  (PDP-
O) that captures  key concepts  and relationships  within  the domain  
of plant pests and diseases.  (In contrast  to other ontologies,  the PDP-
O adapts  a range of ontological  constructs  to represent  domain  entities,  
which,  in turn, increases  the quality  of its structured  measures  and max-
imizes reasoning  capabilities.)
•D e s i g n  and development  of the Evidence-Based  Explanation  Model  
(EBEM)  to demonstrate  the validity  of the outputs  of AgrODSS  by 
pointing  to related  evidence  from the literature.  (This addresses  the 
dearth  of evidence  to demonstrate  the validity  of system  outputs  and 
makes  scientiﬁc  knowledge  easily accessible.)
• Establishing  the SPARQL  endpoint  as a web-based  interface  of 
AgrODSS  and executing  various  queries.  The results  of these queries  
were analyzed  and reported  to demonstrate  the system’s  eﬀective-
ness as a use case in identifying  diseases  and pests and recommend-
ing appropriate  control  methods.
•T h e results  of applying  AgrODSS  to the domain  of date palm pests 
and diseases  were evaluated  by domain  experts,  including  entomol-
ogists and pathologists.
2. Related  work
SWTs and ontologies  have much potential  for data modeling  and ma-
chine reasoning  in various  domains,  including  agriculture.  Several  well-
known  ontologies  and controlled  vocabularies  have been developed  by 
international  organizations  and working  groups  to represent  agriculture  knowledge.  AGROVOC1is the most comprehensive  controlled  vocabu-
lary in this domain  [18]. It contains  more than 40,600  concepts  and 
963,000  terms in 41 languages.  Similarly,  the National  Agricultural  
Library  Thesaurus  (NALT)2was developed  to improve  agricultural  in-
formation  indexing  and retrieval  and contains  more than 135,000  terms 
divided  into 17 subject  categories,  such as food science,  animal  care, 
genetics,  enzymes,  chemistry,  plant diseases,  environmental  sciences,  
and biological  sciences  [19]. However,  AGROVOC  and NALT lack a 
precise  classiﬁcation  for plant diseases  and pests. For instance,  hierar-
chical  relationships  are informally  expressed  with two properties  (i.e., 
skos:broader  and skos:narrower)  which,  unlike  rdfs:SubClassOf,  lack ex-
plicit semantic  inference  rules. This informal  structure  causes  confusion  
in semantic  interpretation  and reduces  the computational  power  of rea-
soning  engines.  Plant Ontology  (PO)3is the most popular  controlled  
vocabulary  to describe  plant anatomy  and development  stages  [20]. 
However,  it lacks vocabulary  for diseases  and pests.
Considerable  research  eﬀorts  have been made to develop  ontology-
based systems  to identify  and control  plant diseases  and pests. For exam-
ple, in [21,22]the authors  present  CropPestO,4an ontology  developed  
as the cornerstone  of an expert  system  to support  farmers’  identiﬁcation  
of pests and to recommend  the appropriate  control  measures,  with a fo-
cus on organic  agriculture  practices.  However,  some pests are associated  
with a sole symptom,  which  is insuﬃcient  to identify  diseases  accu-
rately.  The Plant Disease  Ontology  (PDO)5classiﬁes  plant disease  based 
on the causal  agents  and host plant, focusing  on three plants:  maize,  
wheat,  and rice [23]. However,  this work does not consider  the rela-
tionship  between  plant disease  and its symptoms  or host plants,  and this 
is essential  to disease  identiﬁcation.  Similarly,  Plant-Pathogen  Interac-
tions Ontology  (PPIO)6was created  to describe  the interaction  between  
a host plant and pathogens  [24,25]. PPIO focused  on modeling  relation-
ships between  plants  and their pathogens;  however,  it did not consider  
other aspects  related  to plant diseases,  such as control  methods.  In [26]
the authors  present  a Crop-Pest  Ontology  developed  to facilitate  image  
retrieval  in the domain  of crops and their pests to address  the limita-
tion of the keyword-based  image  retrieval  approach.  This ontology  lacks 
crucial  relationships  between  key concepts,  which  are essential  for ef-
fectively  identifying  plant diseases  or pests. In [27]a Plant Protection  
Ontology  (PPOntology)  was developed  to capture  and model  agricul-
tural knowledge  related  to cereal  plant protection,  especially  barley  
disorders.  Although  this work presents  a useful  modeling  approach  to 
represent  domain  knowledge,  it lacks suﬃcient  information  about con-
trol methods,  which  are limited  to a single category,  ‘pesticide’,  and 
there is no clear link between  this category  and the plant disorder  or or-
ganism.  In [28]an ontology  was created  to model  knowledge  related  to 
the domain  of plant-pathology,  focusing  on diseases  of short-cycle  and 
perennial  crops.  For disease  identiﬁcation  this ontology  relies on a set 
of Semantic  Web Rule Language  (SWRL)  rules to describe  plant diseases  
by their associated  symptoms;  however,  these rules specify  the inferred  
disease  only when the provided  symptoms  match  the set of symptoms  
that describe  that disease.
In [29]t h e authors  present  RiceMan,  an expert  system  developed  
based on Rice Disease  Ontology  (RiceDO)  and Treatment  Ontology  
(TreatO)  [30,31]. These ontologies  model  knowledge  of plant diseases,  
focusing  on rice diseases  in Thailand.  In this work each rice disease  is 
described  on the basis of a class expression  using the rdfs:SubClassOf  
relationship  (in other words,  the class has no individuals  or instances).  
Although  this modeling  approach  can represent  domain  knowledge  
successfully,  it limits the inference  process  to subsumption  reasoning

and reduces  the usability  of SPARQL  queries.  Similarly,  in [2]t h e au-
thors present  a knowledge-based  decision  support  system  that relies on 
AgriEnt-Ontology  to represent  agricultural  entomology  knowledge  to 
support  farmers  in identifying  and managing  insect pests. This system  
relies on ontology  and rule-based  inference  to diagnose  insect pests. 
However,  the dependency  on the predeﬁned  rules to identify  a given 
pest makes  it necessary  to provide  all the symptoms  involved  in these 
rules for the system  to correctly  diagnose  this insect pest. This reduces  
the matching  process  between  entered  and stored  data, since maybe  not 
every single symptom  is noticed  and provided  by users. In [32]the au-
thors present  PCT-O  ontology  that is leveraged  to build a recommenda-
tion system  to facilitate  plant pests’ identiﬁcation  and recommendations  
of suitable  treatments.  However,  symptoms  produced  by pests are de-
scribed  textually,  which  causes  diﬃculties  in reasoning  over this data. In 
addition,  no relationships  were considered  between  the symptoms  and 
the aﬀected  parts, or between  pests and the most susceptible  varieties.
In summary,  most of the works  discussed  above  use ontologies  
to capture  and represent  agricultural  knowledge  to support  decision-
making.  However,  they do not model  all important  aspects  of the do-
main (e.g., disease  and pest identiﬁcation  and control),  resulting  in 
insuﬃcient  knowledge  models  for intelligent  decision-support  systems.  
Although  they implemented  ontologies  in OWL, they did not fully uti-
lize its expressiveness  to adequately  represent  domain  entities,  which,  
in turn, impacts  the quality  of structural  measures  and limits the reason-
ing capabilities.  Furthermore,  the lack of explainability  or evidence  to 
demonstrate  the validity  of system  outputs  ultimately  negatively  aﬀects  
stakeholders’  acceptance  and trust of system  recommendations.  Tables1
and 2summarize  and compare  existing  ontologies  and vocabularies  in 
agriculture.  Table1compares  existing  ontologies  with respect  to the 
structural  measures  used to represent  domain  knowledge.  It shows  that 
most of the developed  ontologies  have not fully utilized  the range of on-
tological  constructs  (such as achieving  an adequate  level of granularity  
to represent  key classes,  using owl:restrictions  to describe  key classes,  
deﬁning  domains  and ranges  for properties,  specifying  property  char-
acteristics,  deﬁning  an adequate  number  of object  or data properties  to 
model  complex  relationships  between  concepts,  and populating  classes  
with suﬃcient  instances)  to eﬀectively  describe  domain  entities.  These 
constructs  represent  the most signiﬁcant  advantage  of semantic-based  
modeling,  playing  a crucial  role in enhancing  the semantic  reasoning  
capabilities  of ontological  models.  Table2compares  existing  ontologies  
with respect  to the knowledge  aspects  covered  by the developed  on-
tologies  and the extent  to which  they represent  important  aspects  and 
relationships  between  domain  concepts.
3. AgrODSS:  agriculture  ontology-based  decision  support  system
AgrODSS  is an ontology-based  DSS system  that aims to support  
decision-making  in identifying  and controlling  plant diseases  and pests. 
The decision-support  aspects  of this system  are to assist stakeholders  
(e.g., farmers,  policymakers,  and advisors)  in properly  diagnosing  dis-
eases and pests, and helping  them make informed  decisions  on appropri-
ate control  methods.  In addition,  it provides  explanations  and evidence  
to increase  users’ knowledge  and trust of the system  recommendations.  
The architecture  of AgrODSS  and the workﬂow  of system  development  
are described  in the following  subsections.
3.1. AgrODSS:  architecture
It is recognized  that, to eﬀectively  manage  and analyze  information  
for decision-making,  decision  support  systems  should  include  at least 
three core components:  (1) a database,  (2) a model  processing  compo-
nent, and (3) a user interface  [33]. From this perspective,  AgrODSS  is 
built on a layered  functional  architecture  with three layers  (see Fig.1): 
(1) the semantic  layer, (2) the processing  layer, and (3) the web inter-
face layer. The layers  and components  of AgrODSS  are described  below.
Fig. 1.GeneralarchitectureofAgrODSS.
3.1.1. Semantic  layer
The semantic  layer of AgrODSS  consists  of two semantic-based  mod-
els: PDP-O  and EBEM.  On the one hand, the role of PDP-O  is to capture  
key concepts,  terms,  and relationships  related  to plant diseases  and 
pests, representing  them in a machine-understandable  format.  On the 
other hand, the role of the EBEM  is to semantically  annotate  knowledge  
sources  related  to plant diseases  and pests to demonstrate  the validity  
of AgrODSS  recommendations  by pointing  to related  evidence  from the 
literature.  Both PDP-O  and EBEM  form the knowledge  base of our sys-
tem; they consist  of a T-Box (or ontology  schema)  and an A-Box,  which  
contains  RDF data (or instances)  of classes  deﬁned  by the T-Box.  De-
tailed descriptions  of the design  and development  of PDP-O  and EBEM  
are presented  in Sections3.2.3and 3.2.4, respectively.
3.1.2. Processing  layer
This layer comprises  three core components  responsible  for man-
aging,  analyzing,  and inferring  information  for the decision-making  
process:  a graph database  (for storing  RDF data in the form of a knowl-
edge graph),  a query engine  (to access  the graph database  and retrieve  
information  based on structured  queries),  and a reasoner  engine  (for 
computing  inference  rules embedded  in the semantic  layer and generat-
ing inferred  RDF triples).  We implemented  AgrODSS  using GraphDB,7a 
semantic  repository  that supports  storing,  manipulating,  reasoning,  re-
trieving,  and visualizing  RDF data.
This layer serves  as an intermediary  between  the semantic  layer and 
the web interface  layer. The query engine  processes  SPARQL  queries  
involving  input data (such as symptoms,  environmental  conditions,  
and crop type) and searches  the system  knowledge  base for potential  
matches  related  to this input.  Meanwhile,  the reasoning  engine  com-
putes implicit  relationships  among  data elements  deﬁned  in the seman-
tic layer, inferring  possible  matches  (e.g., diseases  or pests) relevant  to 
user queries.
3.1.3. Web services  layer
Currently,  the web-based  SPARQL  endpoint  serves  as a means  of ac-
cessing  AgrODSS  (Access  to this SPARQL  endpoint  can be provided  
on demand).8A SPARQL  endpoint  is a front-end  interface  that allows  
users (humans  or applications)  to access,  browse,  and query the system’s

tabular  format  or as a knowledge  graph.  We present  use cases for exe-
cuting  various  SPARQL  queries  via the AgrODSS  SPARQL  endpoint  in 
Section3.2.4.
3.2. The workﬂow  of AgrODSS  development
To develop  AgrODSS,  we designed  a research  roadmap  consisting  of 
ﬁve phases  (see Fig.2): (1) requirements  speciﬁcation,  (2) knowledge  
acquisition,  (3) ontology  design  and development,  (4) evidence-based  
explanation  model  design  and development,  and (5) establishment  of 
the AgrODSS  web-based  SPARQL  endpoint.  The following  subsections  
provide  a detailed  description  of each phase.
3.2.1. Requirements  speciﬁcation
This phase aims to assess the feasibility  of developing  AgrODSS  as a 
practical  solution  for supporting  decision-making  in the agricultural  do-
main. Additionally,  it focuses  on gathering  information  about user needs 
to identify  system  requirements.  Our approach  to specifying  AgrODSS  
requirements  incorporates  three requirements  elicitation  techniques:
1.Literature  review  and analysis: This involved  reading  and analyzing  
related  work, browsing  oﬃcial  institutions’  websites,  and reviewing  
publications  from authoritative  sources  (e.g., statistical  reports,9
guidelines,10and expert  opinions).
9https://ncpd  .gov .sa /statistics.
10https://ncpd  .gov .sa /services  /page /farm1  /palm -care -guide.2.Consultations  with domain  experts: We conducted  this task by holding  
regular  online  meetings  with two domain  experts  (one entomolo-
gist and one pathologist),  each with over 10 years of experience  
in plant diseases  and pests, particularly  those aﬀecting  date palm 
crops.  They provided  us with essential  knowledge  that our ontology  
should  cover to perform  proper  diagnosis  and recommend  suitable  
control  methods.  For example,  they emphasized  focusing  on the 
major diseases  and economically  signiﬁcant  insect pests impacting  
date palms.  In addition,  they shared  an Excel datasheet  containing  
names  of diseases  and insect pests, associated  symptoms,  aﬀected  
plant parts, favorable  environmental  conditions,  and suggested  con-
trol methods.  Furthermore,  they recommended  including  images  
that illustrate  the symptoms  associated  with each disease  or pest. 
Finally,  they provided  us with knowledge  sources  for further  infor-
mation  extraction  to expand  the system’s  knowledge  base.
3.Cross-sectional  survey: A cross-sectional  survey  was shared  with 217 
people  in the agricultural  sector  (farmers,  researchers,  advisors,  
guidance  oﬃces,  government  agencies,  professionals,  and scien-
tists) in Saudi Arabia  to identify:  (1) the need for information  tech-
nologies  in supporting  agricultural  decisions,  (2) the diﬃculties  in 
the management  of diseases  and pests of date palms,  and (3) stake-
holders’  attitudes  towards  the use of technology  to facilitate  making  
their decisions.  An example  of the important  ﬁndings  revealed  by 
the survey  is that current  practice  is traditional,  as 33.6%  of stake-
holders  rely on previous  experience  to manage  disease  and pests. In 
addition,  there is a lack of technological  solutions,  as only 8.3% of 
stakeholders  use technology  to support  their decisions  (More infor-
mation  about the survey  and its ﬁndings  can be found in Supplementary  
data A).

Therefore,  based on the results  obtained  by carrying  out the three 
elicitation  tasks, we speciﬁed  the AgrODSS  requirements,  including  its 
purpose,  scope and limitations,  intended  end-users,  and functional  re-
quirements,  as follows:
•AgrODSS  purpose: is to provide  various  stakeholders  in the agri-
culture  ﬁeld with computerized-based  decision  support  to assist in 
plant diseases  and pest identiﬁcation  and control.
•AgrODSS  scope and limitations: AgrODSS’  scope is plant disease  and 
pest identiﬁcation  and control.  The identiﬁcation  of diseases  and 
pests is based on external  symptoms  visible  to the human  eye, such 
as leaf spots, mildew,  wilting,  discoloration,  and similar,  therefore  
internal  symptoms  are not included.  For the use case purposes,  we 
populated  the knowledge  base with data related  to date palm dis-
eases and pests. This is because  the date palm is an important  food 
crop and plays a signiﬁcant  role in the economy  of countries.  It is 
prone to attack  by many pests and diseases,  causing  roughly  a 30% 
loss in yield [34]. Furthermore,  like other knowledge  areas in agri-
culture,  retrieving  the information  relevant  to date palms  poses a 
challenge  as most of the domain  knowledge  is in a human-oriented  
format  and there is a deﬁciency  of semantic-based  representation.  
Considering  the abovementioned  importance  and deﬁciencies,  the 
rationale  for our choice  is justiﬁed.
•AgrODSS  target audience: the targeted  end users of AgrODSS  are: 
(1) Farmerswho are looking  to identify  diseases  and pests early to 
prevent  their spread  and to obtain  suitable  treatments  to reduce  
the impact  of pests and diseases  on their crops,  (2) Advisorswho 
need support  to recognize  the relationship  between  symptoms  and 
diseases,  and between  diseases  and their causes.  Without  intelli-
gent systems,  they rely on experience  and need to memorize  all the 
complex  relationships  to make proper  diagnoses  or suggest  the ap-
propriate  control  measures,  (3) Researchers  and Studentswho can 
use AgrODSS  to investigate  the relationships  between  entities  (e.g., 
symptoms  and pathogens)  and simulate  speciﬁc  scenarios  for their research,  and (4) Government  Agencies, AgrODSS  provides  a stan-
dard data model  that can facilitate  data integration  from various  
data sources  in these organizations  to assist managers  in making  
decisions  based on data and evidence  rather  than pure intuition.
•AgrODSS  functional  requirements : Table3illustrates  AgrODSS’  main 
functional  requirements,  classiﬁed  into four categories  with corre-
sponding  Competency  Questions  (CQs).  CQs are user-oriented  ques-
tions; in other words,  questions  that users would  like to answer  
by exploring  and querying  AgrODSS.  Furthermore,  CQs outline  the 
scope of the ontology  and play an essential  role in its development  
and evaluation,  ensuring  it meets user requirements.
3.2.2. Knowledge  acquisition
Based on the requirements  identiﬁed  in the previous  phase (i.e., Sec-
tion3.2.1), we conducted  knowledge  acquisition  activities.  Knowledge  
acquisition  is a continuous  and independent  activity  throughout  the 
ontology  development  process,  aiming  to capture  the most important  
concepts  and relationships  within  the domain  of interest.  In this work, 
we relied on several  knowledge  sources  for knowledge  acquisition,  cat-
egorizing  them as structured  (e.g., ontologies)  and unstructured  sources  
(e.g., research  articles,  books,  guideline  documents,  and Excel spread-
sheets).
•Knowledge  acquisition  from analyzing  structured  sources: this activity  
aimed  to extract  the relevant  concepts  and relationships  from ex-
isting ontologies  for reuse in our ontology,  and helped  to speed up 
the ontology  construction  process.  Our survey  of available  ontolo-
gies included  searching  in search  engines  and ontology  repositories  
such as AgroPortal  [35](which  can be navigated  online11) and Crop 
Ontology  [36], which  provides  an open-source  web interface  known

as (Crop Ontology  Curation  Tool)12for ontology  sharing.  We inves-
tigated  and analyzed  a set of ontologies  in the agriculture  domain,  
particularly  concerning  pests and plant diseases.  The most relevant  
ontologies  are the Plant Disease  Ontology  (PDO),  Plant Protection  
Ontology  (PPOntology),  Crop-Pest  Ontology,  Plant-Pathogen  Inter-
actions  Ontology  (PPIO),  RiceDO  and TreatO,  and CropPestO.  Alist 
of classes  and properties  extracted  from each of these ontologies  
to construct  our ontology  can be found in Supplementary  data A). 
By comparing  these ontologies,  we found similar  concepts  to rep-
resent  plant diseases  and pests. These concepts  may overlap,  and 
some may have the same meaning,  but our goal is to speed up the 
construction  of PDP-O  by reusing  terms or concepts  from existing  
well-deﬁned  ontologies.  Fig.3illustrates  the process  of analyzing  
and comparing  three existing  ontologies,  PPOntology,  PDO, and 
Crop-Pest  Ontology,  showing  some class hierarchies  of these on-
tologies  and the similarity  between  classes.
•Knowledge  acquisition  by analyzing  unstructured  sources: this activity  
aimed  to expand  the knowledge  base by analyzing  non-ontological  
knowledge  sources  and adding  further  terms that were not included  
in previous  ontologies,  in addition  extracting  axioms  and individ-
uals for ontology  population  and enrichment.  This activity  was 
carried  out manually  to extract  information  from text documents.  
The rationale  behind  the manual  approach  is that the complexity  
of domain  knowledge  and overlapping  between  terms make adapt-
ing fully automatic  text analysis  techniques  ineﬀective.  Besides,  
accurately  extracting  ontology  entities  and mapping  them to the 
corresponding  class with appropriate  relations  requires  designat-
ing complex  natural  language  processing  (NLP) algorithms,  which  
have been proven  inaccurate  [37]or not encouraging  [32]. Our cor-
pus is knowledge  resources  related  to plant disease  in general,  but 
we gave special  attention  to sources  related  to the cultivation  of the 
12https://cropontology  .org.date palm. These knowledge  sources  provide  reliable  information  
on date palm pests and diseases,  and describe  the signs and symp-
toms of each disease  and the causal  agent (such as fungus  and insect 
pests).  The ﬁrst step in the extraction  process  was to parse the tex-
tual content  to extract  related  entities  and available  images  from 
the source  ﬁles. Then, the textual  content  was transformed  into in-
stances  according  to the PDP-O  model  and used to ﬁll the various  
properties  to describe  ontology  instances,  while images  of pests and 
symptoms  are stored  as a graphical  description  of related  instances.  
After that, each item of textual  content  was stored  with the corre-
sponding  knowledge  source  to identify  the scientiﬁc  evidence  of the 
facts stored  in the ontology.  The main issue of these data sources  
is their heterogeneity  since none is completely  structured  and uni-
form. Some provide  the information  in tables,  but most information  
is described  in plain text. Fig.4illustrates  the knowledge  acquisi-
tion process  by analyzing  the textual  content  of one such knowledge  
source.  Acquisition  of extensive  knowledge  about date palm pests 
and diseases  allowed  us to achieve  good coverage  of the axioms  
required  to model  various  relationships  between  ontology  entities,  
to represent  them as OWL axioms,  and thus increase  the computa-
tional power  of our ontology.
3.2.3. Plant Diseases  and Pests Ontology  (PDP-O)  design and development
This phase is one of the most important  in the development  of the 
AgrODSS.  It focuses  on knowledge  modeling  by adding  semantics  to 
the processed  data from the previous  phase (i.e., Section3.2.2) to cre-
ate PDP-O.  PDP-O  was implemented  using the Web Ontology  Language  
(OWL),13allowing  us to describe  domain  concepts  and express  far more 
complex  relationships  that are bound  to exist between  these concepts.  
As a suitable  ontology  development  environment,  we chose Java-based  
Protégé  [38]. Protégé  is an open-sourced  ontology  editor  designed  to

facilitate  the creation  of OWL ontologies,  and it is supported  by a set 
of plugins  such as Pellet Reasoner,  to verify automatically  the ontology  
consistency.
Ontology  development  is an iterative  engineering  process  of several  
fundamental  steps to ensure  the correct  achievement  of deliverables.  In 
this work, three popular  ontology  engineering  methodologies  [39–41]
were considered  as the baseline  for building  PDP-O.  Each methodol-
ogy has its unique  features,  but in general,  the overall  approach  in-
volves  ontology  development  steps that do not vary widely.  While these 
methodologies  deﬁne  the necessary  steps or workﬂows  for develop-
ing the ontology,  we continuously  collaborated  with domain  experts  
through  online  workshops  to establish  a commonly  agreed  knowledge  
framework.  They veriﬁed  that each class was relevant  to our domain  
of interest,  that all classes  were arranged  within  the correct  taxonomy  
and suitable  level of granularity,  and that all classes,  properties,  and 
their deﬁnitions  (both formal  and informal)  communicate  the intended  
meaning  and accurately  represented  the characteristics  of the domain.
The implementation  of PDP-O  started  with the automatic  import  of 
relevant  classes  and properties  from existing  ontologies  (as mentioned  in 
Section3.2.2). This import  was achieved  through  soft reuse [42], which  
involves  directly  copying  selected  ontology  classes  and properties  from 
the source  ontology  into our ontology  using the ‘Refactor’  tab in Pro-
tégé. Original  axioms  deﬁning  entities  were removed  to maintain  consis-
tency of our ontology.  For instance,  classes  such as Microorganism,  Pest, 
Pest_Insect,  Pest_Mite,  Cultural_Practice , as well as properties  like has_cul-
tural_practice  and scientiﬁc_name , were imported  from PPOntology.  Once 
entities  are imported,  the next task was to extend  the ontology  by 
adding  additional  classes,  properties,  and axioms,  organizing  them, and 
creating  semantic  links between  various  ontology  entities.  Currently,  
PDP-O  consists  of eleven  top-level  classes  (i.e., Plant_Disease , Pest_Dam-age, Symptom, Causal_Agent , Host_Plant, Plant_Part, Plant_Variety , Symp-
tom_Characteristic , Time, Control_Method , and Causal_Agent_Trait ), which  
are the root of their own sub-trees.  These classes  and their own sub-
classes  represent  basic concepts  within  the subject  of plant diseases  and 
pests. An excerpt  from the PDP-O  is illustrated  in Fig.5.
We aimed  to address  the limitations  of previous  works  by develop-
ing a domain  ontology  with far stronger  reasoning  ability  and providing  
suﬃcient  knowledge  to support  complex  decisions.  Our approach  to 
achieve  these goals consists  of ﬁve main strategies:  (1) building  PDP-
O class hierarchy  with a ﬁner level of granularity,  (2) enhancing  PDP-O  
classes  description  using OWL axioms,  (3) relationship  modeling  for en-
hanced  reasoning,  (4) enriching  the meaning  of PDP-O  properties  by 
attaching  property  characteristics,  (5) populating  PDP-O  classes  with 
suﬃcient  instances  (or individuals).  The following  points  provide  a de-
tailed description  of each one of these strategies.
•Building  PDP-O  class hierarchy  with a ﬁner level of granularity
Class hierarchies  deﬁne  a speciﬁc  type of binary  relation  that cap-
tures inheritance  between  classes.  In OWL ontologies,  the standard  
construct  for representing  this relationship  is rdfs:subClassOf.  We 
paid special  attention  to classify  each key class in PDP-O  to a ﬁner 
level of granularity.  For instance,  the Causal_Agent class tree pro-
vides an extended  taxonomy  that semantically  describes  disease-
causing  agents,  including  both biotic and abiotic  agents  (see Fig.5). 
To represent  biotic agents  we started  with the Microorganism class 
and listed its subclasses  (that include  Fungi, Bacteria,  Nematodes,  
Viruses,  Phytoplasmas,  Protozoa,and Viroid). However,  after care-
fully studying  domain  knowledge,  we concluded  that other organ-
isms aﬀect plant health  but are not considered  to be pathogens,  such 
as insects  and mites,  so we created  a class called  𝑃𝑒𝑠𝑡to represent

those organisms.  Then, to organize  these classes  into a hierarchal  
relationship,  we created  a more general  class that includes  all pre-
vious classes  called  Organism, which  is a subset  of the more general  
class called  Biotic_Casual_Agent . The same approach  was taken to 
other superclasses  (e.g., Symptom,  Plant_Disease,  Pest_Damege , and 
Plant_Part). When we built the class hierarchy  with a ﬁner level 
of granularity  using rdfs:subClassOf,  we enhanced  the subsumption  
reasoning  to infer automatically  that members  of the subclass  are 
included  as members  of the superclass.  This simple  inference  mech-
anism  in knowledge  representation  gives ontology  its advantage  
over traditional  databases.
•Enhancing  PDP-O  classes  description  using OWL axioms
An axiom  in OWL ontologies  is a statement  that represents  a basic 
piece of information,  and may involve  a class, property,  and in-
dividuals.  These axioms  constitute  explicit  knowledge  about plant 
pests and diseases,  and are available  in our system’s  knowledge  
base. Logic (i.e., Description  Logic)  provides  the means  to deter-
mine precisely  the logical  consequences  from a set of axioms,  while 
the reasoning  engine  (e.g., Pallet)  allows  the system  to derive  im-
plicit knowledge  from a set of explicitly  asserted  axioms.  Therefore,  
by describing  classes  using OWL axiom  we empowered  our system  
to be more intelligent  and infer new facts about explicit  knowl-
edge, thus we expanded  the system  knowledge  base (further  details  
about explicit  knowledge  extraction  are discussed  in Section3.2.2). 
For instance,  we deﬁned  𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠_𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡_𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒class using the 
following  logical  rule:
𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠_𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡_𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 ≡𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡_𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒⊓ ∃𝑖𝑠_𝐶𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑_𝐵𝑦.
(𝐵𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎⊔𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑔𝑖⊔𝑁𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑒⊔𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑚𝑎⊔𝑉𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑖𝑑⊔𝑉𝑖𝑟𝑢𝑠 )
(1)
The rule (1)states  that an infectious  plant disease  is a plant disease  
caused  by infectious  organisms  (i.e., bacteria,  fungi, nematode,  phy-
toplasma,  viroid,  and virus).In addition,  we deﬁned  the Plant_Fungi_Disease class using the fol-
lowing  logical  rule:
𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡_𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑔𝑖_𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 ≡𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠_𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡_𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒
⊓∀𝑖𝑠_𝐶𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑_𝐵𝑦.𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑔𝑖 (2)
The rule (2) states  that plant fungi disease  is an infectious  plant 
disease  caused  by fungus.  Consequently,  the reasoning  engine  au-
tomatically  infers that if an individual  has a causal  agent that is 
fungi, it is a fungal  plant disease  based on rule (2), thus an infec-
tious disease  based on rule (1).
•Relationship  modeling  for enhanced  reasoning
The hierarchical  structure  alone can not provide  a full description  
of any class. To achieve  a complete  description,  the properties  must 
also be assigned  to classes.  PDP-O  deﬁnes  a set of properties  that en-
ables the system  to identify  plant pests and diseases  and recommend  
suitable  control  methods.  For example,  has_Symptom describes  the 
relation  between  a disease  and symptoms  expressed  by a host plant. 
Because  several  diseases  share multiple  symptoms,  making  it chal-
lenging  to make a proper  diagnosis,  to deal with this issue we 
deﬁned  the 𝑖𝑠_𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑟_𝑂𝑛property  to describe  the plant part where  
the symptom  is observed,  thus allowing  us to distinguish  diseases  
that share multiple  symptoms.  Furthermore,  because  knowledge  re-
lated to environmental  contexts  such as temperature,  humidity,  and 
rainfall  can enhance  the accuracy  of disease  identiﬁcation  beyond  
considering  only those symptoms  visible  to the human  eye, we de-
ﬁned the ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝐸𝑛𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙 _𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟as super property  of three ob-
ject properties:  ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦_𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟, ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙_𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟, and 
ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 _𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟. Similarly,  because  a signiﬁcant  variation  
in susceptibility  to a speciﬁc  disease  may occur within  cultivars  of a 
plant species,  we deﬁned  the 𝑖𝑠_𝑆𝑢𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 _𝑇𝑜property  to describe  
the relation  between  a plant disease  and the most susceptible  vari-
eties. Table4describes  PDP-O’s  important  properties,  their domain,  
range,  characteristics,  and meaning.

Listing  1: Semantic  rule and inferences  of the transitive  property  
ℎ𝑎𝑠_𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡.
•Enriching  the meaning  of PDP-O  properties  by attaching  property  
characteristics
OWL allows  the attachment  of characteristics  to object  and data 
properties,  making  relationships  between  entities  explicit  and de-
scribing  their meanings  more precisely.  Therefore,  we speciﬁed  the 
inverse  property  of each object  property  in PDP-O,  regardless  of 
its subPropertyOf  level, and attached  other characteristics  such as 
Symmetric,  Asymmetric,  Functional,  Inverse  Functional,  Transitive,  Re-
ﬂexive,  and Irreﬂexive(see Table4). For instance,  the transitive  
property  was used to represent  the transferable  relationship  be-
tween  entities.  This states that if ‘x’ relates  to ‘y’ via the property  ‘P’ 
and ‘y’ relates  to ‘z’ via the same property,  it implies  that ‘x’ relates  
to ‘z’ via ‘P’. In PDP-O,  we deﬁne  the property  has_Partand its in-
verse property  is_Part_Ofas owl:TransitiveProperty because  a plant is 
composed  of main parts, which  in turn are composed  of sub-parts,  
and we want to represent  each plant part independently.  The se-
mantic  rule and inferences  of the transitive  property  has_Partare 
explained  by Listing1.
This type of modeling  is important  for two reasons.  First, it 
enables  the representation  of plant morphology  in a machine-understandable  way. Second,  it allows  the modeler  to determine  
whether  a speciﬁc  plant part displays  abnormal  symptoms,  which  
is crucial  for accurately  diagnosing  plant diseases.
•Populating  PDP-O  classes  with suﬃcient  instances  (or individu-
als)
Instances  are the most speciﬁc  elements  in the domain  of discourse.  
In Protégé  the term ‘instances’  and ‘individuals’  are used inter-
changeably.  We enriched  PDP-O  with suﬃcient  instances,  most of 
which  were captured  by analyzing  text-based  content  during  the 
knowledge  acquisition  phase.  Currently,  PDP-O  contains  555 indi-
vidual  instances  added  to the main classes  that address  most compe-
tency questions.  We emphasized  Plant_Fungi_Disease , Insect_Damage , 
Organism, Plant_Part, Control_Method and Symptom, as these are di-
rectly involved  in disease  identiﬁcation  and control,  to give answers  
with suﬃcient  information  for decision  support.  Our focus included  
describing  18 fungal  diseases  and 14 insect pests with signiﬁcant  
economic  impact.  Additionally,  the ontology  covers  146 symptoms  
associated  with these diseases  and pests. It is worth  noting  that, 
to overcome  the overlap  between  the symptoms  associated  with 
plant diseases  and pests, we associated  each disease  or insect pest 
with at least three distinct  symptoms.  This enabled  the system  to 
achieve  a more accurate  diagnosis.  For example,  the description  of 
the inﬂorescence  rot disease  of date palms  is presented  as a knowl-
edge graph in Fig.6. The graph contains  six classes  (i.e., Fungi, 
Symptom,  Chemical_Control,  Agricultural_Practice,  Environmental_Fac-
tor, and Time) involved  in the description  of this disease  (which  is 
deﬁned  as an instance  of Fungi_Disease_Of_Date_Palm ). Each of the 
classes  contains  some instances  related  to inﬂorescence  rot disease  
associated  with it through  object  properties.  For example,  consider-
ing that “infected  inﬂorescences  covered  with white powdery”  and 
“rot of ﬂowers  and spikelets”  are distinct  symptoms  of inﬂorescence  
rot disease,  we used has_Symptom to associate  this disease  with its 
symptoms.
3.2.4. Evidence-Based  Explanation  Model (EBEM)  design and development
This phase presents  our approach  to designing  and developing  the 
Evidence-Based  Explanation  Model  (EBEM).  As previously  mentioned,  
while the role of PDP-O  is to model  knowledge  about plant diseases  and 
pests, the role of EBEM  is to provide  evidence  supporting  the validity  of 
AgrODSS  outputs,  such as diagnoses  and recommendations.  Several  cat-
egories  of explanation  approaches  are discussed  in the literature,  such as 
contextual-based,  trace-based,  and case-based  [17,43,44]. In this work, 
our focus is on scientiﬁc  evidence-based  explanation,  concerned  with

answering  questions  such as: “Is there evidence  from the scientiﬁc  work 
supporting  ontology  assertion  (i.e., RDF statement)?”.
•EBEM  design
Two design  criteria  have been considered:  (1) to identify  the evi-
dence (i.e., a piece of text from scientiﬁc  work)  that supports  an 
RDF statement  asserted  in our ontology  (i.e., PDP-O),  and (2) to 
provide  metadata  about the knowledge  sources  from which  the ev-
idence  was extracted.  To this end, we classiﬁed  the information  ex-
tracted  from knowledge  sources  (see Section3.2.2) into two types: 
(1) reasoning  information,  which  is facts (or RDF statements)  used 
to develop  PDP-O  (e.g., the disease  name,  symptoms,  causal  agents,  
and control  methods);  and (2) supporting  information  used to de-
velop EBEM  to provide  evidence  for the facts asserted  in the PDP-O  
(e.g., text from guideline  documents  or research  articles).  To illus-
trate the design  process,  suppose  a paper is published  to describe  a 
particular  type of disease  and its proper  control  method  (e.g., dis-
ease D has chemical  control  C as backed  by evidence  Z). The ﬁrst 
part of this information  is captured  and modeled  in the PDP-O  as an 
RDF triple.  However,  we want to annotate  this RDF triple to state 
that evidence  Z supports  it. Fig.7provides  an illustration  of this 
idea.
•EBEM  implementation
As in PDP-O,  EBEM  was implemented  using OWL in Protégé.  OWL 
enables  the representation  of the intended  explanations  in this work 
in a machine-readable  format,  allowing  modelers  to model  state-
ments  about other statements,  a process  known  as reiﬁcation  [45]. 
Since EBEM  is a semantic-based  representation,  we created  the nec-essary  classes,  properties,  and instances  to represent  explanations.  
EBEM  developed  around  two central  classes:  Explanation and Knowl-
edge. The Explanation class was created  as a superclass,  where  each 
explanation  type is a subclass  of this class. Since our focus is on 
evidence-based  explanation,  this class has been specialized  into a 
more speciﬁc  class called  Scientiﬁc_Explanation , which  in turn has 
the Evidence_Based_Explanation class as a subclass.  Instances  of the 
last class represent  evidence  that supports  RDF facts asserted  in 
PDP-O.  The Knowledgeclass was created  as a sibling  of the Explana-
tionclass. It has been specialized  into one class, Scientiﬁc_Knowledge , 
which  was created  to semantically  represent  various  types of knowl-
edge sources  as instances  of this class, such as academic  articles,  
books,  thesis,  proceedings,  etc.
To achieve  more expressive  semantic  modeling,  we deﬁne  a set 
of object  and datatype  properties  to establish  relationships  be-
tween  classes  or instances.  The properties  of Scientiﬁc_Knowledge
class have been reused  from Dublin  Core14(DC) namespace,  which  
provides  a standard  vocabulary  to represent  scientiﬁc  publica-
tions. Examples  of such properties  include  dc:title,  dc:date,  dc:lan-
guage,  dc:source,  dc:publisher,  dcterms:identiﬁer, and dcterms:hasVer-
sion. One of the important  properties  of Evidence_Based_Explanation
is the object  property  EBEM:is_Derived_From , which  associates  the 
Evidence_Based_Explanation class with the Scientiﬁc_Knowledge class 
to establish  the relation  “scientiﬁc  evidence  X is derived  from knowl-
edge source  Y”.

is supported  by Scientiﬁc_Evidence_49 .
•PDP-O  and EBEM  linking  process
Our goal here is to link the RDF statements  asserted  in PDP-O  to 
the scientiﬁc  evidence  in EBEM  that supports  their assertion.  To 
this end, the object  property  has_Scientiﬁc_evidence was deﬁned  in 
PDP-O,  and its inverse  property  is_Scientiﬁc_evidence_Of was deﬁned  
in the EBEM  to link entities  in the two models.  Then, OWL axiom  
annotations  are used to link each RDF statement  in PDP-O  with 
corresponding  scientiﬁc  evidence  in EBEM.  The following  formula  
represents  the general  syntax  of axiom  annotations.
[x rdf:type  owl:Axiom;
x owl:annotatedSource  s;
x owl:annotatedProperty  p;
x owl:annotatedTarget  o;
x PDP-O:has_Scientiﬁc_evidence  SE;]
Where  ‘x’refers to the RDF statement  which  consists  of ‘s’, which  
refers to the subject  of ‘x’, ‘p’which  refers to the predicate  of ‘x’, 
and ‘o’which  refers to the object  of ‘x’. The last triple refers to 
the scientiﬁc  evidence  that supports  ‘x’, associated  by the property  
hasScientiﬁcEvidence and its value ‘SE’. We added  these annotations  
using a SPARQL  query in GraphDB  (see Fig.8). As shown  in the ﬁg-
ure, we used the INSERT  DATA  operation  in the SPARQL  query to 
add OWL axiom  annotations  to the RDF statements  asserted  in PDP-
O and link them with the supporting  evidence  asserted  in EBEM.  
The GRAPH  clause  speciﬁes  the URI of a particular  graph to which  
one or more OWL axiom  annotations  are added;  in our case, we 
provide  the URI of PDP-O  to this clause.  A single INSERT  DATA  
request  can be used to add multiple  OWL axiom  annotations  to a 
given graph.  Fig.9presents  a conceptual  overview  to illustrate  the 
linking  process  between  PDP-O  and EBEM  and describes  the asso-
ciations  necessary  to understand  its idea.
3.2.5. Establishing  AgrODSS  web-based  SPARQL  endpoint
After developing  PDP-O  and the EBEM,  we imported  both into 
GraphDB.  Our goal here was to establish  a SPARQL  endpoint  as an in-
terface  for users to access  AgrODSS  from the front-end.  In this section,  
also we demonstrate  the eﬀectiveness  of AgrODSS  by executing  SPARQL  
queries  through  the SPARQL  endpoint  to obtain  directly  complex  in-
formation  to support  agriculture  decisions  regarding  disease  and pest 
management.  For this purpose,  we formulated  19 CQs to be answered  
by the knowledge  base, some of which  are shown  in Table5. These ques-
tions were created  in accordance  with the CQs that deﬁne  the system  
requirements  (as outlined  in Section3.2.1, Table3). By answering  these 
questions  we identiﬁed  diseases  or pests practically,  recommended  ap-
propriate  control  methods,  and gave scientiﬁc  evidence  to supports  the 
recommendation.  To illustrate  how AgrODSS  utilizes  semantic  technolo-
gies and ontological  reasoning  to answer  CQs questions  in Table5, we present  and discuss  the following  exemplary  scenario:
Usage  scenario:
“Suppose  dark brown  or black hard lesions  appear  on the leaf rachis and 
the palm’s  new leaves become  twisted  and malformed,  along with round to 
oblong  dark brown  spots on the external  surface  of unopened  spathes:  what 
do these symptoms  indicate?  Furthermore,  what type of problem  do these 
symptoms  suggest?”
This scenario  represents  the situation  in which  the user provides  the 
system  with more than one symptom  observed  on a date palm tree. 
Fig.10shows  the SPARQL  query executed  to identify  the problem  pre-
sented  in the above  scenario,  which  is related  to CQ1 in Table5. This 
query searches  for a disease  or pest that inﬂuences  a plant that has 
the scientiﬁc  name “Phoenix  Dactylifera”  and produces  three diﬀerent  
symptoms:  (1) “dark brown  or black hard lesions”  that appear  on a plant 
part “leaf rachis”,  (2) “malformation”  that appears  on a plant part “new 
leaf”, and (3) “round  to oblong  dark brown  spots”  that appears  on a 
plant part described  as “external  surface  of unopened  spathe”.  It ﬁnds 
what these symptoms  indicate  and also what type of disease/pest  these 
symptoms  refer to.
The results  retrieved  from the previous  query are shown  in Fig.11. 
From the result set, we can note that there is a single deﬁned  problem  
associated  with the three symptoms  provided,  which  is Black_Scorch_Dis-
ease. Since the query contains  more speciﬁc  information,  this helps 
to narrow  down the number  of results  to a single disease.  Moreover,  
the results  in Fig.11show additional  information,  we can see that 
Black_Scorch_Disease is a kind of Plant_Disease , Infectious_Plant_Disease , 
Plant_Fungi_Disease , and Fungi_Disease_Of_Date_Palm . The interpretation  
of this conclusion  is as follows:  because  we classiﬁed  the Plant_Dis-
easeclass based on the infection  process  into Infectious_Plant_Disease
and Noninfectious_Plant_Disease , then Infectious_Plant_Disease class has 
been classiﬁed  based on the major causes,  such as Bacterial,  Fun-
gal, Viral, Phytoplasma, and so on. In addition,  each of these classes  
(i.e., Plant_Fungi_Disease ) has been classiﬁed  based on the host plant 
(i.e., Fungi_Disease_Of_Date_Palm ). Therefore,  based on class taxonomy  
and the logical  rules deﬁning  these classes  (as discussed  in Sec-
tion3.2.3), the reasoner  automatically  inferred  that Black_Scorch_Disease
is of the type Infectious_Plant_Disease , Plant_Fungi_Disease and Fungi_Dis-
ease_Of_Date_Palm . These results  answer  the question  CQ1 in Table5
(What  do the abnormal  symptoms  observed  on a plant, or its parts, in-
dicate?).
After the problem  is diagnosed,  the next step is to suggest  the appro-
priate control  or treatment.  The queries  shown  in Fig.12were executed  
to provide  users with recommendations  on the appropriate  methods  to 
control  Black_Scorch_Disease .
The query in Fig.12a is related  to CQ2 in Table5, namely  to 
recommend  the appropriate  chemical  control  of a particular  pest or 
disease.  Similarly,  the query in Fig.12b corresponds  to CQ3 (What

are the suitable  culture  control  of a particular  disease/past?).  The re-
sults retrieved  from the previous  queries  are shown  in Fig.13. The 
query in Fig.13a returned  four control  methods  (Thiophanate_Methyl , 
Copper_Oxychloride , Mancozeb, and Metalaxyl-M ) recommended  to con-
trol Black_Scorch_Disease . These control  methods  are from the class 
Fungicide. The query in Fig.13b returned  six control  methods  rec-
ommended  to control  Black_Scorch_Disease , which  are from the class 
Cultural_Control . In addition,  the results  of the previous  queries  show 
usage for the recommended  control  methods,  answering  the question  
CQ4 in Table5(How can the recommended  control  method  be ap-
plied?).  It is worth  mentioning  that AgrODSS  oﬀers another  type of 
control  method  (i.e., biological  control);  however,  for demonstration  
purposes,  we show only two types of control  methods  (chemical  and 
cultural).
In the second  step above,  AgrODSS  provides  recommendations  to 
control  the problem  diagnosed  in the ﬁrst step. As we aimed  to demon-
strate the validity  of these recommendations  and increase  users’ knowl-
edge, AgrODSS  performs  an additional  step, which  is to provide  sci-
entiﬁc  evidence  that supports  these recommendations.  For example,  in 
Fig.13a AgrODSS  recommends  the chemical  substance  Mancozebto con-
trol Black_Scorch_Disease , so what is the scientiﬁc  evidence  that supports  
this recommendation?  The query in Fig.14was performed  to answer  
this question.  Fig.15shows  the results  of the previous  query.
We can see from the results  in Fig.15the piece of text from which  the 
RDF statement  was formulated,  the title of the knowledge  source  (i.e., 
book) from which  the text was extracted,  the authors  of the scientiﬁc  
work, and the location  (title of the chapter)  of the text in the knowledge  
source.  These results  answer  question  CQ5 in Table5. By presenting  the 
supporting  evidence,  AgrODSS  helps increase  user trust and validate  the 
generated  recommendations,  as users can easily compare  the SPARQL  
query results  with answers  from domain-speciﬁc  documents.  Moreover,  
it increases  users’ knowledge  of disease  and pest management  and makes  scientiﬁc  works  accessible  to target stakeholders.  For more information  
they can easily refer to the domain-speciﬁc  documents  obtained  by the 
SPARQL  query.  Additionally,  presenting  supporting  evidence  not only 
makes  recommendations  valid from user standpoints,  but also serves  a 
crucial  role in assisting  developers  with ontology  debugging.  Domain  
ontologies  contain  information  about entities  extracted  from multiple  
knowledge  sources.  In this context,  knowing  the scientiﬁc  basis of each 
assertion  is vital if errors are detected  or the knowledge  sources  change,  
making  it easy to update  ontology  content  as knowledge  of the domain  
evolves.
For non-technical  users, GraphDB  hides the complexity  of the tech-
nology  and enables  full-text  searching  for any resource  in the AgrODSS  
knowledge  base to explore  it without  writing  SPARQL  queries.  For ex-
ample,  if the user searches  for Black_Scorch_Disease they can view the 
results  as a knowledge  graph (see Fig.16). We can see from the vi-
sual graph on the left side of the ﬁgure further  information  about 
Black_Scorch_Disease , such as the most susceptible  varieties  which  an-
swers question  CQ6 in Table5, and also shows  other symptoms  as-
sociated  with the disease.  In addition,  each node of the graph can 
be expanded  for more information.  For instance,  if the user selects  
Dark_Brown_Or_Black_Hard_Lesions_On_Leaf as the symptom  that matches  
their observation,  then they can see information  such as the plant parts 
aﬀected  by this symptom  and symptom  characteristics.  The right panel 
of the graph displays  symptoms  with their textual  description  and im-
ages. Textual  descriptions  and images  could assist in the diagnostic  
process  to narrow  down the possible  diseases  into those to be consid-
ered and those that can be eliminated.  In addition,  it becomes  eﬀortless  
to use, especially  for farmers.  These results  answer  question  CQ7 in 
Table5. Finally,  the graph shows  that causal  agents  of Black_Scorch_Dis-
easeinclude  environmental  factors  (i.e., high humidity,  silty soil, and 
moderate  temperature)  and biotic factors  (i.e., Chalara_Paradoxa and 
Ceratocystis_Paradoxa ).

4. AgrODSS:  ontology  and system  evaluation
This section  presents  our evaluation  approach  to assess key aspects  
of AgrODSS.  In this work, the Pellet reasoner  2.2.0 and OntoDebug  
0.2.2 (Protégé  plugins)  were consistently  used to verify the ontology’s  
coherence  and consistency.  However,  human  evaluation  is essential  to 
assess the accuracy  and eﬀectiveness  of AgrODSS  in supporting  user de-
cisions.  This evaluation  was conducted  by answering  the CQs executed  
in SPARQL  query forms.  A satisfactory  result for CQs is a way to assess 
the achievement  of objectives  of an ontology-based  project  [46]. A to-
tal of 90 CQs were validated  for this test, divided  into ﬁve categories  
related  to the knowledge  aspect  covered  by PDP-O,  mainly  disease  or 
pest, symptoms,  causal  agents,  control  methods,  and others  (i.e., the 
most aﬀected  plant parts by a given disease  or pest, most susceptible  va-
rieties  to a given disease  or pest, and the active  times of an insect pest). 
Then, the results  obtained  by executing  SPARQL  queries  were submitted  
to the domain  experts  for validation  using a structured  questionnaire.  
The questionnaire  included  90 closed-ended  questions  (corresponding  
to the number  of CQs) and relied on a 7-point  Likert Scale range from 
(1= Strongly  disagree)  to (7= Strongly  agree),  which  allowed  domain  
experts  to express  how much they disagree  or agree on each answer.  
We asked domain  experts  to rate the results  generated  by the system  in 
terms of “Accuracy”.  Accuracy  means  “the degree  to which an ontology  
provides  the correct  results  with the needed  degree  of precision,  and can be 
measured  by the number  of CQs that received  the correct  answers”[47]. The 
AgrODSS  passes  the competency  validation  test if all CQs have answers  
and are graded  at least as ‘Somewhat  agree’.
A total of 11 domain  experts  were involved  in this evaluation,  includ-
ing 7 entomologists  and 4 pathologists  (detailed  information  about domain  
experts  involved  in this evaluation,  CQs with corresponding  SPARQL  queries,  results  obtained  by the AgrODSS  system,  and the results  of domain  experts’  
evaluation  of each category  can be found in Supplementary  data A). To 
ensure  expert  engagement  in the evaluation  process,  online  workshops  
were held to explain  the overall  goals of the system  and the require-
ments  for the evaluation  process.  These workshops  also included  initial  
evaluations,  where  we presented  the ontology  structure,  demonstrated  
inferences  made by the reasoner,  and showcased  the results  of selected  
SPARQL  queries.
Table6gives the summary  results  of evaluation  by domain  experts.  
The evaluation  results  demonstrate  that AgrODSS  had promising  re-
sults. The overall  accuracy  is 80.66%,  achieving  87.53%  accuracy  for 
causal  agent recognition,  81.09%  accuracy  for disease  and pest iden-
tiﬁcation,  83.84%  accuracy  for symptoms  that have been correctly  
associated  with the corresponding  disease  and pest, and 69.71%  ac-
curacy  for recommending  the appropriate  control  methods.  Also, re-
sults in Table6show that recognizing  the causes  (abiotic  or biotic)  
that contribute  to the emergence  of disease  achieved  the highest  accu-
racy. Meanwhile,  recommending  the appropriate  control  methods  for 
a given disease  or pest achieved  the lowest  accuracy.  Although  the 
recommended  control  method  is suitable  (i.e., chemical),  it needs a 
more professional  answer  as so many aspects  govern  the eﬀective  use of 
chemicals.  For example,  the application  rates vary according  to the ap-
plication  method;  the concentration  in the immersion  method  is often 
higher  than for direct spraying.  Also, the application  rate and method  
depend  on the stage of the insect’s  life cycle; for example,  some insec-
ticides  are eﬀective  when the insect is in the larva stage yet ineﬀective  
against  the adult insect,  or they diﬀer in the application  method  or con-
centration  rate. Besides,  pests may have developed  resistance  against  
some pesticides  over time. To address  this issue, we needed  to inter-
view a group of domain  experts  to establish  a set of rules to be more

precise  regarding  chemical  substances  and restrict  their use for each 
case.
Finally,  Table6shows  that the remaining  categories  (disease/pest,  
symptoms,  and others)  achieved  similar  accuracy  (Agree).  The reason  
behind  not reaching  the greatest  accuracy  (i.e., Strongly  agree)  is the 
similarity  and overlap  of symptoms  produced  by the various  types of 
casual  agent (i.e., fungi, bacteria,  and insects),  which  leads to confu-
sion and poses a diﬃculty  in correctly  diagnosing  a disease.  For ex-
ample,  CQ: What does a dark brown  stripe that appears  on the dorsal  
side of the rachis  from the base to the top indicate?  (in Disease/Pest
Category)  returns  a total of three possible  problems:  Bayoud_Disease ; 
Fusarium_Wilt_Disease ; and Reddish_Brown_Parallel_Spot_Disease . These re-
sults were rated by domain  experts  as “two Agrees”,  with one “Strongly  
agree”  by three pathologists,  and was rated as “Disagree”  by one ento-
mologist,  due to the overlap  between  symptoms  produced  by various  
types of casual  agents.
5. Conclusion  and future  work
Agricultural  production  is constantly  threatened  by various  diseases  
and pests that aﬀect crops,  leading  to signiﬁcant  economic  losses and 
rising concerns  about food security.  The identiﬁcation  and control  of 
plant pests and diseases  is a complex  decision  and knowledge-handling  
problem.  Multiple  factors  aﬀect this decision,  ranging  from environ-
mental  conditions  to biological  causes.  Consequently,  in this work, 
we present  an Agriculture  Ontology-Based  Decision  Support  System  
(AgrODSS),  which  aims to assist decision-making  regarding  plant dis-
ease and pest identiﬁcation  and control.  AgrODSS  architecture  consists  
of two semantic-based  models.  First, we designed  and developed  Plant 
Diseases  and Pests Ontology  (PDP-O),  which  captures  key concepts,  
terms,  and relationships  related  to plant diseases  and pests and repre-
sents them in a machine-understandable  format.  Additionally,  PDP-O  
provides  an in-depth  computational  schema  enriched  with suﬃcient  
RDF data for intelligent  decision-making.  Second,  we designed  and de-
veloped  an Evidence-Based  Explanation  Model  (EBEM)  that points  to 
evidence  from related  literature  to demonstrate  the validity  of the sys-
tem outputs.  Furthermore,  a use case is presented  with real-life  data 
regarding  date palm pests and diseases  to demonstrate  the eﬀectiveness  
of AgrODSS.
AgrODSS  was evaluated  practically  with 11 domain  experts,  includ-
ing entomologists  and pathologists.  It obtained  encouraging  results  with 
an overall  accuracy  of 80.66%  in identifying  of disease  and insect pests 
that aﬀect date palms.  Although  the current  version  of AgrODSS  ob-
tained  encouraging  results,  several  issues must be addressed  to provide  
better decision  support.  For instance,  the current  version  is centered  on 
a speciﬁc  crop (date palm),  which  left our system  unable  to deal with 
diseases  and pests aﬀecting  other crops.  This is due to manually  instanti-
ating the ontology  that led to the insuﬃciency  of data and rules covered  
by the PDP-O.  However,  the PDP-O  can be easily extended  to deal with 
other crops,  diseases,  and insect pests. In this sense,  we seek to build 
a Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP) tool to extract  relevant  data from 
available  unstructured  knowledge  sources  for automatically  enriching  
the ontology  by adding  new instances,  relations,  and rules. This tool 
will also assist in keeping  the PDP-O  up to date and make it easy to 
update  the ontology  content  as the knowledge  in the domain  evolves.
There are several  research  directions  for future  work. First, the cur-
rent version  of AgrODSS  is available  only as a SPARQL  endpoint.  We 
plan to make it more human-friendly  by designing  and developing  a 
mobile  application  that allows  various  stakeholders  to beneﬁt  from it to 
make informed  decisions.  Second,  once the mobile  application  is com-
plete, the next step is to evaluate  the system’s  usability  and determine  
user satisfaction  through  ﬁeld trials (i.e., farmers  who use AgrODSS  in a 
real environment  to perform  observations  and identify  a disease).  Third,  
PDP-O  can be improved  by linking  it to the Global  Agricultural  Open 
Data Cloud (GAODC)  to make local data interoperable  with global  ef-
forts and maximize  the data available  to decision-makers.  For example,  it could integrate  PDP-O  with chemical  databases  such as PubChem  [48]
and ChEBI  [49]to include  more details  on chemical  substances.  Finally,  
we need to consider  that agricultural  information  has strong  local char-
acteristics  related  to local climate,  soil, culture,  and local species.  There-
fore, we plan to integrate  AgrODSS  with web services  such as location  
and weather  services  to provide  timely  information  and location-based  
decision  support.
