Soil/society relations ABSTRACT  
Despite their key importance for ecosystems and societies, soils have long remained a peripheral topic in the 
human and social sciences. Our paper aims to account for the recent, fast-growing literature in human and social 
sciences on soils. We first highlight social sciences ’ shared concern for unsettling common visions of soil as a 
surface, a background or a taken for granted stock of resources; then we show that the works at stake differ in 
terms of: (i) their linkage with soil science disciplines and fields, (ii) the social science theories they mobilise, (iii) 
their main contributions, and (iv) their approach to soil materialities and agencies. Following these criteria, we 
present three strands of research on soil-related issues: (1) Literature bearing on the politics of soil knowledge 
investigates how soil becomes an object of knowledge and management; (2) Soil new materialism addresses 
practices and ethics ofcaring for the living soil; (3) Soil decolonial studies unravel soils ’ powers and the 
intertwined agencies of soils and societies. By examining these research agendas, we suggest that social and 
human thinkers have, in the past two decades, tended to shift from a focus on the socially constructed nature of 
soils, to a growing emphasis on soils ’ own biophysical agency in shaping societies, also in line with soil sciences 
insights and works. We argue that the increasing uptake of soil in human and social sciences contributes to an 
increasing concern for achieving better theoretical and empirical accounts of the co-constitution of society and 
the material world.   
1.Introduction 
Despite their key importance for ecosystems and societies, soils have 
long remained a peripheral topic in the human and social sciences. As 
Swidler (2009) argued over a decade ago, during the biggest part of the 
20th century, canonical view of soil in the human and social sciences 
were often based on a possibilist model whereby soils were seen as a 
mere resource for the development of human societies. These views 
rarely aligned with soil sciences views about the dynamic nature of soils 
and their morphology, but rather with the relatively static agronomical 
and physicochemical approaches that dominated the second half of the 
twentieth century. During this period, according to Winiwarter (2014) , 
agronomy broadcasted a limited conception of soil fertility based on a 
few agronomic factors, and tended to reduce it to a simple substrate able 
to absorb the nutrients necessary for the growth of cultivated plants. 
Despite notable breakthroughs inspired by pedology and soil mapping – 
such as the unpacking of various indigenous soil classification systems 
by ethno-pedologists (Barrera-Bassols and Zinck, 2003 ), or the study of 
the social causes of erosion by political ecology (Blaikie, 1985 ) – the majority of social and human scientists continued to see soil as a natural 
variable, a stock of resources, and a simple material basis for the social 
dynamics that play out on its surface. 
Soil scientists, on their part, have long contemplated how human 
activities could be taken into account in their own discipline. Even 
though Hans Jenny ’s original formulation of the five factors of soil 
formation (1941 ) did not directly include humans, Jenny insisted that 
humans have the ability to modify and alter these factors. He later stated 
that humans were in fact a subset of the ‘organism ’ factor (Amundson 
and Jenny, 1991 ), a rather naturalizing view of human activities. Others 
later considered that humans should be thought of as a separate an-
thropic factor (Effland and Pouyat, 1997 ) or ‘sixth factor ’ of soil for-
mation (Dudal, 2004 ). Towards the end of the century, these discussions 
gained importance as the scale of human modification of the earth ’s soils 
became more apparent. Lehmann and Stahr (2007) prompted the soil 
sciences to better develop a basic understanding of the functioning of 
anthropogenic soils, while Richter et al. (2011) insisted that pedology 
should altogether redefine itself as ‘anthropedology, ’ a proposed disci-
plinary development that understands human activities as integral to

2soil genesis. In 2006, the new soil group Technosol made its appearance 
in the FAO ’s World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), referring 
to soils and ground types that have been formed or heavily modified by 
human activities. Even though these attempts have attracted some 
criticisms because of the somewhat generic understanding of humans 
and techniques that they encompass (Engel-Di Mauro, 2014 ) based on 
de-historicised, de-contextualised, and de-politicized concepts of 
‘anthropos ’ and ‘techne ’, they have helped develop a better mutual 
understanding between very separate disciplines. The attention towards 
anthropogenic soils has raised difficult questions about how humans ’ 
and other animals ’ actions differ, how technique comes to bear its mark 
on the environment to the point that it becomes hard to differentiate the 
two, and how to live on a planet that has become durably degraded. 
Interestingly, these questions are also at the core of new approaches 
to soils in the humanities and social sciences that we address here. In 
contrast with earlier static approaches to soil, we have been witnessing 
an ecological turn of the soil sciences since the turn of the 21st century, 
relying on a (re)affirmation of the ‘living ’ nature of soil and bolstered by 
a new interest in the microbial life that inhabits and creates it. The 
notion of ‘living soils ’ (Gobat et al., 2004 ) – although not exactly a new 
idea (Balfour, 1943 ; Pessis, 2020 ) –has progressively gained new trac-
tion in the fields of pedology, ecology, decontamination and agronomy 
as well as in national and international institutions, opening up aware -
ness to the role of microbiota within the functioning of the biosphere, as 
well as a ‘downward ’ extension of the scope of inventorying and con-
servation concerns around soil meso- and micro-biodiversity. Soil, now 
described as the ‘last biotic frontier ’ (Andr ˘e et al., 1994 ), is increasingly 
viewed as the earth ’s largest reservoir of biodiversity, with one gram of 
soil harbouring up to one million different organisms (Bardgett & van 
der Putten, 2014 ), most of which are yet to be described or even 
identified. 
These new views also paralleled unprecedented attention to soils in 
the global environmental agenda (Hartemink, 2008 ; Hartemink and 
McBratney, 2008 ), as evidenced by the revision of the World Soil 
Charter and the launch in 2015 of the International Decade of Soils, and 
by the recent publication, alongside reports on global desertification 
(UNCCD, 2014 ), of reports examining the link between soil degradation 
and issues pertaining to biodiversity loss (IPBES, 2019 ) and climate 
change (IPCC, 2019 ), that all stress the rapid degradation of soils at the 
global level. These reports warn that nearly 33 percent of the world ’s 
soils have been irretrievably degraded by human activity (FAO & ITPS, 
2015 ), that 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost each year (UNCCD, 
2014 ), and that soil in agricultural zones is lost 10 to 40 times faster than 
it is in natural soil formation and replenishment processes (Pimentel and 
Burgess, 2013 ). They stress that beyond concerns about threats to soil 
biodiversity, knowledge of soils is becoming ever more vital to the 
identification, management and securing of a wide range of ‘services ’ 
(Robertson, 2012 ; Mc Bratney et al., 2014 ; Baveye et al., 2016 ) provided 
by soils, including food provision, waste decomposition, water filtration, 
climate regulation. This rise of soils as a topic in global environmental 
agendas and programs was also fostered by the rise of more holistic 
approaches in soil research, leading to the merging of traditional soil 
and agronomy programs into more environmentally related de-
partments at the level of university training, and to new linkages and 
partnerships between pedology, agronomy and related sciences (geo-
morphology, climate science, etc.). 
This suggests how the soil sciences have moved from an agronomic 
model of the soil as a ‘stock ’–a fertile capital subject to human 
appropriation – to a more ecological model approaching the soil as a 
dynamic and vulnerable ecosystem continuously produced by the ac-
tivity of a myriad of organisms that populate it and degrade, transform 
and combine the materials that constitute it (Lavelle and Spain, 2001 ; 
Gobat et al., 2004 ; see also Churchman, 2010 for more details on the 
holistic focus on soil that has long been specific to soil sciences beyond 
the diversity of their sub-disciplines). In this review article, we assess 
how these new perspectives on soils as an animated compound, located in the physical and life sciences, offer possibilities for new articulations 
and understandings of soil-human relations in the human and social 
sciences. 
We show that, paralleling the ecological turn in soil sciences and the 
rising focus on dynamic, living soils, recent literature demonstrates the 
emergence of a variety of new strands of research and thinking in the 
human and social sciences related to soils, that share a key concern for 
unsettling common visions of soil as a surface, a background or a pre- 
existing, taken for granted stock of resources for human enhancement 
and cultivation, and provide distinct understandings of soil activity and 
agency. By focusing on new objects such as public soil policies (Howard 
and Lawson, 2015 ), urban soils (Meulemans, 2020b ), urban gardening 
(Mcclintock, 2010 ), the greening of tillage in agriculture (Krzy-
woszynska, 2019 ), relationships to soil microfauna in alternative agri-
culture (Birnbaum and Fox, 2014 ), or the use of soil as a convenient 
receptacle for a variety of wastes (Hird and Clark, 2013 ), these works 
take note of new approaches to ‘living soil’ (as unfolding in the natural 
sciences) and suggest to ‘think with soil from the social sciences ’ (Sal-
azar et al., 2020 ). They call for new approaches to soil, in the dual sense 
of territory and living substance, that would be able to take the measure 
of the fundamental importance and vulnerability of underground life 
forms. Our key point is that this developing literature does not only 
address the variety of people ’s engagements with soils and the socially 
constructed nature of soils: it also highlights the embeddedness of social 
and political patterns within soil shifting ecologies and biophysical dy-
namics, thus putting a growing emphasis on the importance of soils ’ own 
biophysical agency in building and shaping societies. This tendency thus 
tends to give more room for the consideration of the nature, functioning 
and evolution of soils within the human and social sciences works and 
literature, as they increasingly recognize that soils are not just as a mere 
stock, or a set of inert resources for human use and exploitation, but are 
instead active, dynamic and vulnerable ecosystems. 
Rather than providing an all-encompassing review of this literature, 
this paper is intended as a reflexive report and discussion of the fast- 
growing literature addressing soils in the human and social sciences in 
the last two decades. Starting from the observation that these works are 
broadly located in Human Geography (see Table 1), but differ in terms of 
(i) their linkage with certain soil science disciplines and fields, (ii) the 
social science fields and theories they mobilise, (iii) their main contri -
butions, and (iv) their approach to soil materialities and agencies, we 
identify and present three strands of social research on soil-related 
issues: 
(i)The first set addresses the politics of soil knowledge, i.e. in-
vestigates how soil becomes an object of knowledge and man-
agement in various human groups and communities.  
(ii) The second set addresses practices and ethics ofcaring for the 
living soil and documents the development of new relations and 
attunements with soil biota beyond productivist and tech-
noscientific practices of soil fertilisation and control; this 
research calls for a better recognition of the agencies and 
vulnerability of the living soil.  
(iii) The third set of literature offers decolonial approaches to soils, i. 
e. unravels soils ’ powers and the intertwined agencies of soils and 
societies; this research encompasses land and deep soils and 
stresses the role of soils in shaping not only the material basis for 
human life but also various political organisations and philo -
sophical ideas across humankind development. 
It should be noted that this typology does not correspond to well- 
bounded, successive periods: all three strands of scholarship have 
rather been coexisting during the last 20 years in an ongoing, still open 
conversation fostered by an increasing concern among authors to do 
justice to soils ’ materialities and agencies and their capacity to inter-
vene, shape and reconfigure human communities and organisations. 
This conversation has led to the current coexistence of those three bodies C. Granjou and G. Meulemans

3of work that, each in its own manner, seeks to address not only how 
humans conceive of soils and transform them, but also how soils 
contribute to shaping human organisations and collectives. In particular, 
we would like to highlight social scientists’ growing focus on accounting 
for the importance of soils’ own biophysical dynamics and agencies in 
building and shaping societies. We argue that, in the past two decades, 
social and human thinkers have tended to shift from a focus on the so-
cially constructed nature of soils, to an emphasis on the role of soils in 
shaping human organisations, collectives and philosophical ideas. 
Furthermore, this review suggests that the increasing uptake of soil in 
the human and social sciences should not be understood in terms of the 
emergence of a new ‘discipline’ or subfield dedicated to soil. Rather, it 
attends to human and social sciences’ ongoing efforts and reflections to 
shape non-anthropocentric theories and epistemologies that would 
make it possible to rethink social existence no longer in terms of human- 
only categories and capacities, but in terms of the production of a ‘more- 
than-human’ world at the juncture of social and bio-geo-physical agencies. 
In the rest of the paper, we shall describe those three sets of work and 
emphasise their tensions, mutual criticisms and attempts to better ac-
count for the co-constitution of soils and societies. 
2.The politics of soil knowledge– how soil becomes an object of 
knowledge and management 
A first set of literature, located in approaches ranging from Science 
and Technology Studies (STS), Actor Network Theory (Latour, 2005), 
Political Ecology (Leach and Mearns, 1996) and Foucauldian ap-
proaches to governmentality (Foucault, 2009) (see Table 1), addresses 
the way in which soils have been treated as a resource to be managed 
and exploited. Rather than taking soils as a taken for granted resource 
for exploitation, this research work aims to denaturalise the category of 
‘soil’, by showing how the soil is constituted and secured as an object of 
knowledge, exploitation and government. These authors often posit that 
‘soils’, as an entity, do not exist out there, ready to be surveyed and 
extracted as resources: instead the technologies of knowledge and pro-
specting (i.e. cartography, surveys, assessments and estimates…) 
contribute to them being constructed as intelligible and governable ob-
jects and resources. They stress that, to be governed, soils need to be 
rendered visible and calculable via a range of theories, devices and in-
stitutions. Several authors have therefore researched how soils are ‘so-
cially constructed’ as knowable and manageable entities through expert 
and scientific categories. They often focus on conflicts and discrepancies 
in how soils are known, measured, and understood. 
One strand of this literature draws on Actor Network Theory (ANT) 
(see Table 1) to show how qualifications of soils as ‘resources’ do not 
directly derive from their natural, taken for granted properties, but 
rather from discursive, legal and material mechanisms that allow them 
to be ‘translated’ or ‘assembled’ as such. For example, Murray Li (2014), 
an anthropologist working in the Indonesian highlands, uses an ANT 
approach to examine practices and devices that allow assembling 
formerly common land as a (private) resource open for global invest -
ment. In Li’s account, devices such as fences, title deeds and regulations 
allow translating land and soil materially and discursively at the same 
time, changing how qualities and values are attributed to them, and 
making them participate in a very different form of social life organised 
around international trade rather than local dynamics. Accounts such as 
that of Li therefore describe how values and properties are attached to 
various soils, thus building the conditions for the exploitation of soil 
resources and their circulation on markets in the same movement. 
Other authors taking a critical stance at modern, managerial ap-
proaches to soil have focused on conflicts and controversies between 
different ways of knowing and understanding soils – thus unpacking the 
‘politics of soil knowledge’ meant as the various ways in which soils 
come to be known, represented, mapped, and conceived of by various 
soil practitioners, experts, and scientists (Kon Kam King et al., 2018). 
Farmers, foresters, government officials, soil scientists, or environ -
mental NGOs know soils in different ways and attach different meanings 
to them (Warkentin, 2006; Landa and Feller, 2009). Moreover, the di-
versity of these understandings does not boil down to a simple division 
between scientific knowledge and local knowledge. Taking inspiration 
in Science and Technology studies scholarship, authors interested in the 
production, circulation and application of soil knowledge have shown 
how scientific and expert knowledge on soil is also situated in different 
social, disciplinary, institutional and economic contexts. Thus, a 
pedologist, an agronomist, or a remote sensing analyst differ in their 
understanding of soil dynamics, and in the scale on which they study 
them. For example, Kon Kam King and Granjou (2020) addressed the 
rise of soil digital mapping instruments since the turn of the 21st century 
and showed how these new techniques contributed to shifting soil sci-
ence profiles and skills away from classical taxonomical pedological 
approaches toward making them part of Earth system modelling efforts; 
and how this contributed to recasting soil as a global container of carbon Table 1 
Disciplines and fields in the human and social sciences.  
Field and Discipline Definition 
Human geography The field of geography interested in social relations to 
space and the environment. 
Science and Technology 
Studies (STS) A field of social sciences that investigates the 
practices, groups and institutions involved in the 
production, circulation and mobilisation of knowledge 
and technologies in society. 
Social and cultural 
anthropology Academic discipline that studies the development of 
human societies and cultures. Environmental 
anthropology is the branch of anthropology that 
studies human groups’ relations to the environment. 
Environmental history A branch of history that addresses the joint 
transformation of human societies and natural 
environments and their interactions. 
Political Ecology A field in social sciences that addresses the political 
dimensions of environmental issues and problems, and 
accounts for the power relations and struggles at stake. 
Continental Philosophy a set of philosophical currents originating in 
continental Western Europe addressing topics such as 
the body, power dynamics, or consciousness, and 
relying on historical or textual analysis rather than 
formal logics. 
Theories and approaches Definition 
Actor-Network Theory 
(ANT) An approach in Science and Technology Studies that 
addresses technical innovation in terms of the 
development of a rising sociotechnical network i.e. a 
network involving both people and objects. 
Decolonial theories An approach, cutting across the humanities, that 
addresses the inequalities and relations of domination 
in North-South settings and denounces the enduring 
legacy of European-centric worldviews and colonial 
forms of imperialism in society. 
Foucauldian approaches Approaches, cutting across the humanities, inspired by 
Michel Foucault’s focus on the role and history of 
knowledge discourses in the constitution of social 
realities and forms of state power. 
Multispecies ethnography An anthropological approach aiming to recognise the 
active role of non-human living beings in 
ethnographic accounts and unsettle the human- 
centred lens of anthropology. 
New materialisms A set of theories, primarily anchored in philosophy 
and anthropology, aiming to revisit the role of 
materialities in social sciences thinking. These 
theories of materialism are ‘new’ because they depart 
from the notion that the material world determines 
social and political dynamics (i.e. Marxist 
materialism) and focus instead on ‘more-than-human’ 
assemblages and communities where material and 
immaterial, or social and natural aspects of the world 
are intimately bounded. 
Theories of Care Writings that focus on activities and perspectives of 
caring for people and non-human entities and 
demonstrate their material and ethical importance.  C. Granjou and G. Meulemans

4to be measured, mapped and enhanced. 
In a similar way, environmental historians have shown how, from the 
onset, the soil sciences have been riddled with controversies about how 
to define soil and to what end (Engel di Mauro, 2014). Furthermore, 
privileging certain kinds of soil understanding and sidelining others had 
direct consequences on the way in which soils are managed and related 
to. Historian Winiwarter (2014) has shown that the promotion and use 
of synthetic fertilisers in the 20th century were based on the idea of soil 
being only a substrate for holding and releasing the nutrients necessary 
for plant growth, rather than an ecosystem and web of vital interactions 
sustaining fertility. Ecological approaches to soils that had been devel -
oped in the first half of the twentieth century (Pessis, 2020) were side-
lined in favour of physico-chemical approaches, following which, 
Winiwarter argues, ‘Agricultural practice was changed in order to match 
the simplified theory that inorganic nutrients are the single most 
important factor in soil fertility’ (Winiwarter, 2014, p. 114). 
Finally, some scholars have combined this STS approach to political 
ecology to study the consequences of specific scientific framings, for 
example to study how soil scientific knowledge is then used to establish 
regulations which bear on the life of local soils and communities. They 
have insisted on how interactions between these different knowledge 
claims result in tensions and debates regarding how soils should be 
managed and protected. Hence, the framing and diagnosis of a specific 
soil-related phenomenon often result in specific recommendations for 
land use or agricultural practices, which in turn may impact soils and 
local communities. For example, in a study of the evolution of ideas 
about tropical soil formation in geomorphology, geographer Duvall 
(2011) has shown how representations of West African ferricretes 
(indurated, iron-rich soils) in colonial soil science were congruent with 
the notion, prominent in early 20th century colonial foresters, that Af-
rican farmers and pastoralists had degraded the continent’s vegetation 
and soils. Even though it was based on slim scientific evidence, and later 
proved to be wrong, this notion persisted for much of the 20th century 
because ‘the representation of ferricretes as damaged soil also materi -
alised the idea that European resource management techniques must be 
imposed to halt the environmental degradation supposedly caused by 
indigenous land management’ (Duvall, 2011 :123). 
Going beyond the anthropocentric limitations of earlier work in 
political ecology, which were criticised for giving too much importance 
to social discourses and practices and how they ‘construct’ soils, Duvall 
and other more recent authors attempt to do justice to the active ca-
pacities of soils themselves, such as their particular opacity, heteroge -
neity, and their diversity. Duvall insists that humans and soils interact in 
the production of scientific knowledge, rather than it being a human 
projection over a passive natural background. To him, soils are agentive 
in the production of knowledge because it was the long timescale of 
ferricrete formation –its specific mode of being and development –that 
made them seem inert to colonial scientists, which supported the view 
that they were degraded soils. 
Be they located within environmental history, political ecology, ANT 
or broader STS approaches (see Table 1), recent scholarship on the 
politics of soil knowledge clearly emphasises the role of material prop-
erties of soils themselves in shaping the promises and anticipation of 
extraction. More broadly put, these approaches help get a sense of how 
processes of knowledge circulation and application participate in the 
joint production of soils and society –a cradle in which soils and society 
are mutually transformed in very concrete ways. Soils are not in the 
background anymore, as humans make them participate in the social 
fabric. However, the vitality of soils is acknowledged only inasmuch as 
humans themselves deploy ways of knowing them as dynamic and 
lively. Let us now turn to approaches in which soil agencies move more 
centre stage. 
3.Soil new materialisms –caring for the living soil 
The second set of literature, strongly inspired by the new materialisms scholarship (Whatmore, 2002; Bennett, 2010; Coole and 
Frost, 2010), multispecies ethnography (Haraway, 2008) and theories of 
care (Puig dela Bellacasa, 2017) (see Table 1), aims for a further step in 
the recognition that soil and subsoil are not just as a mere stock, or a set 
of inert resources for human use and exploitation. This literature focuses 
less on the impacts of various types of soil knowledge on how soils are 
understood, represented and managed, than on the capacity of soil 
ecological insights to open up soils, in particular soil biota, to new social 
conceptions, practices and attachments. It draws on the emergence and 
diffusion of soil biology and ecology, which gained new traction and 
institutional importance in the 1990s and 2000s, highlighting the 
importance of soil organisms, and their interaction with the 
chemico-physical processes that had received more attention until then 
(Lavelle and Spain, 2001; Coleman et al., 2004; Gobat et al., 2004). In 
the past ten years, part of this social science literature was also influ-
enced by the dramatic rise of microbial ecology and environmental 
metagenomics developments that offered soil scientists new instruments 
and technologies to rapidly assess microbial genomes and metabolic 
capacities, thusproviding unprecedented access to the identities and 
roles of microbial associations in soil; (Paul, 2015). This literature in 
human and social sciences elaborates on the emergence and significance 
of new types of attention and relations toward soil among scientists, 
farmers, and soil practitioners. 
At the end of the 2000s, writings by Hird (2009) and Helmreich 
(2009) pioneered a ‘microbial turn’ in social and human sciences by 
discussing the omnipresence and instrumental role of microbes in a 
variety of environments. They suggested how microbes unsettle our 
understandings of life mostly based on ‘big like us’ organisms and 
require us to open up our conceptions of life toward new possibilities of 
existence and agency, not based on the premise of well-bounded in-
dividuals and ‘species’, in order to reconsider the importance of sym-
biosis and cooperation instead of competition in biological evolution 
and adaptation. Further authors extended these insights into soil biota, 
in line with Darwin’s observations about the role of earthworms in soil 
formation and social existence in the early nineteenth century. 
Krzywoszynska emphasised that ‘unlike the big-like-us, microor -
ganisms such as soil biota challenge the separation between living and 
nonliving, bios and environmental services. Their bio-geo-chemical 
agencies have world-making consequences we are struggling to 
conceive of; their systemic nature confounds us’ (Krzywoszynska, 2020: 
231). In a similar vein, Meulemans (2019), an ethnographer of scientific 
work, has described how soil ecologists seek to ‘collaborate’ with 
earthworms to build soil from urban organic and mineral wastes. 
Starting from the description of these scientists’ interactions with soil 
and worms in the lab, Meulemans re-examines classical anthropological 
understandings of the distinctions between ‘making’ and ‘growing,’ 
which intersect with broader dichotomies between nature and technique 
in anthropological thinking. To Meulemans, soil ecologists’ view of soil 
as a mix of particles continually digested and worked upon by a myriad 
of organisms allows to propose new anthropological understandings of 
what it means to make-with, live-with, and collaborate in an animated 
world, rather than in one of passive materials. Taking inspiration in 
Donna Haraway’s notion of sympoiesis, which describes processes in 
which life forms are always ‘making-with’, or ‘worlding-with, in com-
pany’ (Haraway, 2016:58), rather than ‘making themselves’ (as in 
autopoiesis), such work builds on soil ecology (both as a set of theory 
and a way of engaging with soils) as a means to think differently about 
more-than-human dependencies, questioning common notions of mak-
ing and growing, activity and passivity, organic and inorganic, or life 
and non-life. 
The work of philosopher María Puig de la Bellacasa (2014, 2015, 
2019) represents an important source of inspiration to these authors. 
Puig de la Bellacasa called to reconceptualising the role of soil as an 
invisible yet critical bio-infrastructure for all life on Earth, and to 
developing better attunements with the slow rhythms of soil organic 
matter regeneration –far from the rapid rotations of intensive C. Granjou and G. Meulemans

5agriculture crops –on the basis of her observations with the permacul -
ture movement. She called to developing more caring practices and 
approaches to soil, thus doing justice to the existence and capacities of 
soil biota and extending conservation and ethical concerns to 
non-human living beings as well as to the material processes of growth 
and self-regenerating. 
Puig de la Bellacasa inspired a growing focus not only on the active 
capacities of the variety of living things –such as earthworms, fungi and 
bacteria –that inhabit, consume, digest, produce and transform soil 
(Meulemans, 2019; Krzywoszynska, 2020), but also on the active and 
dynamic nature of (top)soil and its particular brand of materiality as a 
heterogeneous mix of living organisms and dead or dying things, 
emphasising the role of decomposition in soil formation and regenera -
tion (Lyon, 2020; Abrahamsson and Bertoni, 2014). These writings share 
the notion that understanding the materiality of living soils requires 
going beyond any strict separation between the biotic and the abiotic, 
the organic and the mineral, the living and the inert, the biological and 
the geological, as well as the natural and the social. They therefore ac-
count for the development of practices of soil attention, sensing and care 
both in traditional agricultural settings (Lyon, 2020) and contemporary 
agriculture (Krzywoszynska, Goulet, 2010), where conventional 
farmers’ growing recognition of the foundational liveliness of soils is 
fostering new promises and hopes centred on the possibilities of 
remaking agriculture (Krzywoszynska, 2020 :229). 
This body of work also includes a focus on urban settings, by 
investigating the emerging practices and communities aiming to build 
fertile soils out of lime and rocks unearthed by the extension of urban 
infrastructures (i.e. roads, parkings, airports…). By focusing on various 
experimentations and technics aiming to bring back life to soils seen as 
waste so far, this literature emphasises soils’ potentialities for growing 
an exuberant and unexpected life within the ruins and interstices of 
urban expansion and soil sealing (Meulemans, 2020a). 
This body of work is strongly committed to developing more atten -
tive and ethical relations with soil as a living and lively ecosystem, with 
which human life is deeply entangled, thus echoing research on soil 
transformation and ‘domestication’ in soil sciences. Starting from the 
observation that soil types and classifications are akin to biological 
species, Amundson et al. (2003) asked for instance what fraction of soil 
species have been transformed and degraded by human activities and for 
human purposes in the case of the USA, leading to drastic changes in soil 
biodiversity, soil carbon content etc. Interest for urban soils in the 
human and social sciences also connects with the works in soil sciences 
demonstrating that urban expansion is a key factor of soil sealing, 
leading to a critical loss of habitats and biodiversity extinction (Sca-
lenghe and Marsan, 2009; Seto et al., 2011). 
By focusing on the sensory and performative aspects of organic 
processes such as plant or bacterial life, these approaches call for greater 
attention to the vulnerability of soil biota (for instance to landfill leak-
ages: Hird and Clark, 2013) and to the relations and interdependence 
that link human life to the life of soils, which provide societies and all 
living things with all the means for their material existence on this 
planet. For a number of authors, compost has thus become a metaphor 
for the type of relations and togetherness in which living and non living 
components ‘become with each other’ without a pregiven plan or goal in 
a profusion of dynamic and regenerative transformations (Abrahamsson 
and Bertoni, 2014; Haraway, 2016). 
However, some authors have remarked, soil life forms do not easily 
conform to the categories and presence-making technologies that have 
allowed conservationists to inventory and protect above-ground species 
and biodiversity (Yusoff, 2012). Indeed, classical policies and metrics of 
biodiversity conservation are based on the possibility to endow them 
with a stable identity, making it possible to protect them (for example 
through endangered species lists) and, above all, to represent them and 
care for them. As Hird and Clark pointed out, ‘a great many of the living 
lineages that are now likely to be “disappearing” have never appeared to 
us in the first place… Too small, too obscure, too reticent to have graced our archives, these beings blink out of existence without ever making 
their presence felt’ (Hird and Clark, 2013, p. 45). They propose to take 
the consideration of soil agencies yet one step aside by shifting the gaze 
away from a focus on organic matter toward deeper soils and the un-
derground, in order to elaborate new theories and accounts of the ma-
terialities and agencies of those soils and their role in shaping human 
societies. 
4.Soil decolonial studies – unravelling soils’ powers and the 
intrication of soil and society agentivities 
The third set of literature draws on continental philosophy, political 
ecology, decolonial studies (see Table 1) and the rich literature 
addressing the meanings of the advent of the Anthropocene –under -
stood as an era marked by the unprecedented and transforming impact 
of human activities over the whole planet –in the humanities and social 
sciences. Authors aim to stress the role of land, soils and deep soils in 
shaping not only the material basis but also the political organisations 
and philosophical ideas of societies all over the development of hu-
mankind. They are inspired by scientific insights from soil ecotoxicol -
ogy, geosciences and Earth system sciences –thus often they do not 
address soils directly, but rather the role of land and deep soils in the 
habitability of our planet. They often take soils (and deep soils for that 
matter) as prime examples of nature’s alterity to (and precedence over) 
human affairs and as illustrating how human lives and institutions are 
embedded within and subjected to biogeochemical processes that also 
foster a permanent condition of human vulnerability. As such, they aim 
to unsettle anthropocentric accounts of society and to decolonize social 
sciences approaches from the belief in human exceptionalism inherited 
from the Enlightment philosophies. 
We feel that this third strand of literature reflects an emerging 
attention and related theoretical thread in the humanities and social 
sciences, and think that it deserves to inspire a deeper and broader 
consideration of soil agency i.e. soil’simportant role in fostering and 
shaping various modes of living and thinking across human history. 
Part of this scholarship starts from a criticism of soil new material -
isms (i.e. the previous strand of literature) for viewing soil mostly as a 
site of promising profusion of life, a site of connections, entanglements, 
symbiosis and mutual flourishing between humans and soil biota (Ureta 
and Flores, 2018; Tironi, 2020). They highlight instead a different kind 
of soil agency, related to the rocky and mineral substrates in soils, 
emphasising the resistance of hard soils and the power of contamination 
of toxic soils. They emphasise the vitality of soil chemical residue -
s–dusts, leachates –and their capacity to circulate in the environments 
and bodies and to contaminate humans, plants and animals (Gramaglia, 
2020) and even soil microbiota itself (Hird and Clark, 2013). By scru-
tinising how toxic soils alter the life of people living on contaminated 
land, they remind us that soils are also characterised by pollution and 
contamination, and more generally not readily available to human 
relation and care. 
This interest in soils whose agencies and transformations constitute a 
threat for humans is shared by human geographers and philosophers 
Nigel Clark and Kathryn Yusoff (Clark, 2011, 2017; Clark and Szers -
zynski, 2021; Yusoff, 2018), who proposed to take yet another step into 
unpacking the powers of soils –encompassing land and deep subsoils. 
Hence, Clark writes of ‘in-human’ soils in order to stress the difference 
with the ‘more-than-human’ entanglements and relations described by 
soil new materialisms authors, emphasising soils’ capacities to unsettle 
human life and communities as well as to shape them. He stresses the 
crucial role of soil in providing human societies with the organic matter, 
the ore, and various types of combustibles instrumental not only to the 
development of agriculture, but also of arts and technologies such as 
metallurgy in ancient times, and fossil fuel-powered machines since the 
18th century. Clark is also particularly interested in soils’ upheavals, 
such as earthquakes and volcanic events, and their impacts on human 
life and communities. He discusses the cultural significance of the C. Granjou and G. Meulemans

6discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s and 1970s, suggesting that 
social thinkers should pay more attention to the fact that peoples and 
societies have always had to do with the incessant dynamism and violent 
upheavals of Earth crust. His key point is that soils’ dynamism has had 
huge consequences both in creating a permanent state of bodily 
vulnerability attached to human life on the Earth, and in fostering the 
development of new political organisations and philosophical ideas 
aiming precisely to undermine this vulnerability and to highlight instead 
human autonomy, freedom and self-determination. To Clarke, the new 
awareness of the geological dynamism of the Earth, gained by 18th and 
19th century scholars1, partly fostered the historical development of 
Enlightment philosophies with their focus on freedom, reason and 
self-determination in the 19th century. Philosophers and scholars’ 
attempt to deny the threats and anxieties induced by the new geo-
scientific knowledge has been leading to a much exaggerated emphasis 
on humans’ capacity to dispose of the material world, including soils and 
land as resources for cultivation, building and mining2. Clark suggests 
that, because of the legacy of these philosophies, Western social thinkers 
did not do justice to the capacity of soils both to destroy social com-
munities, their institutions and moral values almost entirely, and to 
foster life-changing innovations in human ways of living and thin-
king –including land cultivation, metallurgy, and fossil fuel 
combustion. 
In a similar line of thinking, Bobbette and Donovan (2018) addressed 
the history of the geological sciences and the role of geologists in 
shaping our understandings of what Earth and soils are, how they work 
and their relations with social and political processes. The contributions 
to their edited volume depart from the view that ‘the earth is a surface 
upon and across which unfolds the dramas of sovereign territories and 
their politics’ (p. 2) and focus instead on ‘the earth’s organisation into 
strata, and the depth of geological time and transformation’ (p. 3), in 
order to address the intersections of geology and politics. This literature 
shares with the first set of literature an interest in scrutinising how 
scientific knowledge contributed to constituting Earth and soils as ob-
jects of knowledge and representation; yet it also shares with the second 
set of literature a commitment to paying more attention to soils’ own 
materialities, agencies and dynamics. Compared with this latter litera -
ture, this last scholarship gives a new meaning to the idea of soil agency, 
which takes onboard much broader scales and temporalities than those 
considered by soil new materialism: soil agency is no longer associated 
with microbial life but rather with toxic dust durability and with the 
moves and upheavals of the Earth crust. As such, authors of the third set 
of research also contribute to suggesting the porosity of the boundary 
between the realm of the living and that of matter: they suggest the 
vitality, dynamism and agency of soils and how their composition and 
genesis demonstrate the constant interactions and hybridisation of 
matter and living entities. However, authors here are not so much 
interested in establishing more ethical relations with soil biota than with 
unpacking the political and cultural significance of soils’ powers and 
forces –leading to revisiting the vulnerability of human organisations, 
institutions and ideas. 
On the other hand, this literature also suggests that the possibility of the development of humankind is closely embedded within the material 
capacities offered by soils. Clark and Yusoff’s key argument is that the 
contemporary extraction of chemical resources (such as phosphates or 
lithium) from soils should not be understood only in terms of the rise of 
human capacity to make and govern soils as resources (cf. the first body 
of literature): those developments have also been made possible by the 
materialities and powers of soil itself, by its capacity to process and store 
fossilised organic matter over the very long term, for instance. They 
argue that we need to ‘geologize’ human and social thinkers’ accounts of 
social history i.e. to do justice to the fact that what is often understood as 
human innovations and social creativity has been inspired, conditioned 
and shaped by the material capacities and agency of soils. Inspired by 
this, Granjou and Salazar (2019) for instance pointed that our narratives 
of climate change may be too much focused on human-induced increase 
of greenhouse gases, and should pay more attention to soil’s role in 
fostering brutal and irreversible tipping points such as permafrost thaw. 
While its focus on soil is quite broad and encompasses both land, 
deep subsoils and the Earth crust, we think that this last body of work 
sketches new avenues to think of human/soil relations in a different, and 
innovative way, by fostering better accounts of the deep entanglementof 
soil-related and society-related dynamics and agentivities. 
5.Discussion and conclusion 
With this review, we wanted to sketch some of the key contributions 
and tensions of the growing scholarship on soil in the human and social 
sciences in the last two decades. Observing a rich and growing amount of 
research that unpacks various configurations of human/soil relations, 
we proposed a reading of this scholarship based on three groups of lit-
erature –also knowing that the ideas and writings often tend to be more 
permeable to exchanges and circulation than what our review has been 
able to account for. However, our key goal was not to give an all- 
encompassing view of the lineages and circulation that link them 
together: instead we aimed to highlight an ongoing conversation 
regarding how this literature has been considering the material prop-
erties and agencies of soils. Table 2 offers an overview of the three sets of 
literature by outlining the soil science fields and approaches they are in 
line with, the theories and frameworks in the humanities and social 
sciences that they rely on, their main ideas and contributions, and 
eventually the way they address soil materialities and agencies. 
We argue that there has been a growing concern in the human and 
social sciences for considering not only how various societies and peo-
ples engage with soils, but also, symmetrically, how soils contribute to 
shaping social communities and organisations. As they increasingly 
recognize that soils are not just a mere stock, or a set of inert resources 
for human use and exploitation, but are instead active, dynamic and 
vulnerable systems with their own materialities, agencies and dynamics, 
the human and social sciences also tend to build new potential linkages 
and bridges with the soil sciences around the consideration of scientific 
knowledge on the nature, functioning and evolution of soils. 
Concerns for the microbial life and functioning of soil are for instance 
at the core of the development of soil new materialisms and its focus on 
the agency and vulnerability of soil biota; it is eventually deepened and 
expanded in the third group of literature focusing on the power of 
soils –encompassing both land and deep soils –both to destroy and 
constitute social communities, technical innovations and philosophical 
ideas. Social scientific scholarship related to soil is thus more and more 
involved in the endeavour to unsettle the overarching focus of the 
human and social sciences on the influence of human categories, dis-
courses and activities on the constitution of the material world –rather 
than the other way around. 
Here, we think it is important to note that the increasing uptake of 
soil, soil issues and soil knowledge in social and human sciences cannot 
be reduced to a case of applying existing social theories and frameworks 
to a new object, i.e. soils. While anchored in a range of existing theories 
and fields, the emergence of social soil studies clearly contributes to an 1 For instance, Clark discusses the major shift in the temporalities considered 
by European philosophers at the time, away from the notion of a few millennia 
testified to by religious writings, to the consideration of deep time stretching 
back to hundreds of millions year back, during which there were no humans on 
the Earth, leading philosophers to long-lasting anxieties over the place and the 
fate of humankind on this planet (see: Clark, 2011, 2017, and 2020).  
2 Yusoff (2018) also stressed that the extraordinary expansion of soil mining 
activities in the 18th century was not only key to the emancipation and 
enrichment of Europe through the Industrial Revolution, but also to the rise of 
new ideas regarding the inert and passive character of matter, ready to be 
extracted, shaped and used –thus contrasting with the activity, creativity and 
self-determination of humans. C. Granjou and G. Meulemans

7increasing concern for rethinking the place of the natural and material 
world in social and human scientific theories and concepts and 
achieving better theoretical and empirical accounts of the co- 
constitution of society and the material world. Obviously, the writings 
we presented in this review related to soil and soil issues partake in a 
much broader move within the humanities and social sciences, away 
from an ‘over-emphasis on discourse and power [which] often over-
looked the unique capacities of environments and non-human actors to 
act politically ’ (Bobbette and Donovan, 2018 : 25). As these authors 
further stated, ‘scholars have since moved towards insisting on under -
standing non-human agency (…) [thus] allowing the world to properly, 
fully exist independently of human thought/consciousness ’ (Bobbette 
and Donovan, 2018 : 25–26). At the heart of this literature is clearly an 
ongoing attempt to decentre the place of humans in social and human 
scientific work. It opens up new pathways to put more emphasis on soil 
itself without renouncing the critical capacity of human and social sci-
ences to foster critical insights and alternative futures likely to unsettle 
taken-for-granted views on what soils are and how they work in relation 
to social existence. It also opens up to new potentialities for communi -
cating across the soil sciences and the human and social sciences, in line 
with recent attempts to cross disciplinary boundaries and foster inter-
disciplinary insights into soil and soil issues (Lago et al., 2019 ; Baveye, 
2021 ).
