Abstract  
In 2009, two Canadian  poets  Stephen Collis and Jordan Scott  travelled to five different ecosystems  within 
the borders of British Columbia  (BC) . At each location, they left a  copy of the canonical text of physical 
anthropology, Darwin’s Origin  of Species  (1859), open to the elements, for one calendar year. The  project, 
documented in the photographic book Decomp  turned the poets’ usual mode of exp ression on its head: 
instead  of manipulating words to create a final work of linguistic expression,  the poets let nature dissolve 
the integrity of the book, leaving words  and morphemes dangling in poetic fragments. The Decomp  project 
allows us to reflect o n the environmental  influences on language, and the organic  structure of 
language.   The dominant metaphors that describe language  come from the biological world, and from 
Darwin’s theory of evolution  in particular. Languages can be said to evolve,  mutate, grow, stagnate and 
even die. Like the words in Darwin’s text  left to the elements, languages can be isolated by geographic 
factors  and left to fossilize without continued exchange with other cultures. In the forests B.C. the 
metaphorical mapping between bi ology and language becomes literal . We bear witness to the effects of 
entropy on the book and as the line between animate and inanimate agents blurs. As the poets piece  together 
the fragments of Darwin’s prose in Decomp , we are  confronted with such questions , confronted with the 
ephe meral  nature of language and the acts of assembly we all perform every day  in the face of linguistic 
change, and often, decay.

Аннотация  
В 2009 году два канадских поэта Стивен Коллис и Джордан Скотт побывали в пяти различных 
экосистемах Британской Колумбии, где оставили книгу Ч. Дарвина “Происхождение видов” на один 
год. Этот проект, задокументированный в фотокниге “Decomp ”, перевернул прив ычный способ 
выражения поэтов: вместо того, чтобы манипулировать словами для создания финального 
лингвистического произведения, поэты позволили природе разрушить целостность книги. Проект 
“Decomp ” позволяет задуматься о влиянии окружающей среды на язык и о рганической структуре 
языка. Доминирующие метафоры, описывающие язык, происходят из биологического мира и, в 
частности, из теории эволюции Дарвина. Можно сказать, что языки развиваются, видоизменяются, 
растут, стагнируют и даже умирают. Подобно словам в те ксте Дарвина, языки могут быть 
изолированы и окаменеть без постоянного обмена с другими культурами. Метафорическое 
взаимодействие между биологией и языком становится буквальным, грань между живыми и 
неодушевленными агентами стирается . Как собираются фрагме нты текста Дарвина в “Decomp ”, мы 
постоянно собираем язык перед лицом языковых изменений, а часто и упадка.

Decaying Words: The Metaphor of Evolution in Language 
Becomes Literal in a Canadian Forest  
DECOMPOSITION   
In late 2009  and early 2010 , observant hikers in the wilds of British Columbia might 
have noticed, tucked under a tuft of moss or hidden underneath a boulder, a copy of 
Charles Darwin’s (1859) Origin of Species , left open to the elements. The canonical text 
of evolutionary anthropology was left there, on purpose, by two Canadian poets , Stephen 
Collis and Jordan Scott. Exactly one year later they went back to see what had had become 
of the books.  
The project, do cumented in the photographic book Decomp  (Collis and Scott , 2013) 
turned the poets’ usual mode of expression on its head: instead of manipulating words to 
create a final work of linguistic expression, the poets let nature dissolve the integrity of 
the book , leaving words and morphemes dangling in poetic fragments. “I’m not going to 
put the natural into the text,” writes Jordan Scott, one of the poets, “I’m going to put the 
text out into the natural world and see what happens to it” (Collins & Scott , 2013, p. 3). 
The project recasts printed words as organic elements in an organic system.   
The degree to which a physical environment can influence a language can be 
explored here in an absurdly material way. According to Sapir  (1912) , a specific 
environment can affect a language in three ways: at the level of vocabulary; at the level 
of the phonetic system; and at the level of syntax and morphology ( p. 228). He is, of 
course, talking about the effect of environment on a spoken  language, not on wri tten 
artifacts like books. For a spoken language, it is obvious that a speaker’s surroundings 
influence the words they use, both in the collection of words that has been assembled over 
time to refer to the objects in the vicinity, but also in the way that words are chosen as 
conversation unfolds in real -time and speakers react to changes in their environment.   At 
a phonemic and morphological level, though, Sapir  (1912)  argues that language is largely 
independent of environmental effects ( p. 234).

In the weathered pages of Darwin’s Origin of Species , a material manifestation of 
the English language, we see the exact opposite effect. Because words have been written 
into a material form, they are subject to the material ravages of the environments. 
Darwin’s vocabulary remains intact, frozen in time at the moment of writing, but his 
carefully chosen syntactical and morphological structure is compromised. The poets 
delight in finding fragments of sentences that emerge from the detritus, a remix project 
collaboration between non -human agents. “give so Th torians world In each popul  
Malthus the ge grandfather evolution all wa GREAT F eme composition Darwin,” ‘reads’ 
one fragment displaying an eclectic mix of punctuation and word fragments ( Collins & 
Scott, 2013, p. 45). “the hope th little ho natur ing ed if we among accumulated over 
ensoul -ment thoughts,” reads another, a fragment that includes intact morphemes that 
have been severed from their root words, floating, waiting to be reattached to roots they 
can imbue with meaning ( Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 22). Plato’s distinction in Phaedrus , 
meant as a criticism of the practice of writing, between the “ living and dead word ” 
(Jowett, 2008) collapses here: the dead words are living again, themselves imbued with  
vitality through the agency of the forest.  
ISOLATION  
The two poets are engaged in a literal manifestation of what Sapir  (1912)  calls 
“linguistic archaeology” ( p. 232). They re -discover these books as artifacts signifying 
human activity, permanently altered by their state of isolation away from other books and 
other people.   “Where one book was left, amidst some rocks, under ponderosa pine, just 
up the dry slope fr om the sagebrush and grasslands,” write Collins and Scott  (2013) , “we 
found at first only the word species , isolated and torn from the book” ( p.  30). The signifier 
here becomes iconic of the signified: a self -contained unit subject to the forces of change .

This theme of isolation features strongly in the study of languages. Linguist Edwin 
Doran (1954)  draws our attention to the language of the Cayman Islands, “a curious 
mixture of an archaic form of English with fragments of Negro dialect, Spanish forms, 
and expressions common to the Southern United States, as well as a remarkable number 
of nautical wo rds,” ( p. 82). The early inhabitants of this cluster of islands, located between 
Jamaica and Cuba, were an eclectic mix of pirates, ship -wrecked sailors from England, 
and slaves brought through the Middle Passage. The islands are remote and did not feature  
as stops on any well -populated trade circuits, and as such, their language largely froze in 
time. Doran  (1954)  identifies phonemic peculiarities, such as the islanders’ tendency to 
substitute /w/ for /v/ at the beginning of syllables, such as wessel for v essel, or wulgar for 
vulgar, a trait common to Elizabethan cockney ( p. 83). Cayman vocabulary is also heavily 
laden with 17th and 18th-century nautical terminology including windward  to refer to the 
East end of the island, and fathoms  to measure the length s of roads ( Doran, 1954, p. 84).  
But of course, the isolated environment of the Cayman Islands provides a different 
kind of environmental influence from what Sapir had in mind.   The Cayman dialect has 
the features it does because of historical contingenci es, such as the glaring ethical breech 
of transporting humans over the Atlantic Ocean to work as slaves, not because wind and 
rock have sculpted form into the islanders’ words over time. The wind and rock from 
British Columbia can, however, and do sculpt w ords out of book pages, in only one years’ 
time, much to the delight of our itinerant poets.   
ENTROPY  
The poets reveal a sense of glee in watching the sacred texts of an entire discipline 
succumb to the elements, especially when there are so many references to such elements 
within the pages. The signified takes revenge on the signifier, any gap between the two 
collapsed under the force of “heaving frost,” ( Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 101) “insect 
armies,” ( Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 120) and “red natu re” (Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 94). 
But with too much reflection, glee can turn to melancholy, as the initial rush of 
destruction wears off. “It is certainly true that words are transformed. They no longer 
signify shadow, earth,” writes Maurice Blanchot, a s quoted in Collins and Scott  (2013) , 
“an accumulation of syllables that have lost all meaning.” ( p. 123) There is an inevitability 
to the decomposition of the books, just as there is an inevitable decomposition, over time, 
of our languages, our cultures, and of course, our physical bodies. Claude Lévis -Strauss  
(1955)  half-jokingly suggested in the pages of Tristes Tropiques  that we should change 
the name of the field of Anthropology to ‘Entropology,’ as “the study of the highest 
manifestations of this proc ess of disintegration” ( p. 414). Lévis -Strauss  (1955)  acutely 
felt the transient nature of the cultural phenomena he was meant to observe as an 
Anthropologist. “The institutions, morals and customs that I shall have spent my life 
noting down and trying to understand are the transient efflorescence of a creat ion in 
relation to which they have no meaning, except perhaps that of allowing mankind to play 
its part in creation,” he writes (p. 414). The poets Collins and Scott take Lévis -Strauss’ 
pensée  seriously and ‘play a part in its creation’ by committing acts of “creative 
destruction”. They write: “That there are no messages, no poetry after decomposition, but 
a minute ecological process in which we have no part but intrusion, or at best no part but 
the donation of raw material for becoming dirt. Small anti -entropic pockets called

‘evolution’ amid the general irresistible lean of entropy” ( Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 92). 
In response, Collins and Scott  (2013)  “compose in the long wake of decomposition” ( p. 
67).  
 
 
METAPHOR   
The Decomp  project also allows us to reflect on the organic structure of language. 
The dominant metaphors that describe language come from the biological world, and 
from Darwin’s theory of evolution in particular (Lewontin , 1970). Languages can be said 
to evolve, mu tate, grow, stagnate and even die. Languages like the Cayman Island dialect 
can be described as ‘fossilized,’ and will eventually go ‘extinct’ or ‘die’. This 
metaphorical mapping emerged after the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species  in 
1859 and event ually gave rise to the field of evolutionary linguistics. Science historian 
Richard Boyd  (1979)  calls this a “theory constitutive metaphor ” (p. 361), one upon which 
the entire field relies to make sense of observed phenomena. The structure and the 
entailments of the metaphor have largely determined the direction of the research.  “The 
hypothetical, or exploratory, role of metaphor is central to theory development and 
supports the view that it can provide a way to introduce terminology for features of  the 
world whose existence seems probable but many of whose fundamental properties have 
yet to be discovered,” he writes ( Boyd, 1979, p. 357).  
Darwin  (1871/2004)  himself mused about the similarities between natural selection 
in the biological world and the  change of languages over time in Descent of Man  writing

that “ The formation of different languages and of distinct species, and the proofs that both 
have been developed through a gradual process, are curiously parallel ” (p. 59). 
Some p hilosophers of science have suggested that scientific theories are, by 
necessity, analogical in form, in order to create a simplified and understandable model of 
nature (Hesse , 1966). In the 19th century, linguists engaged in philology, the comparative 
analysis of languages, in order to try and find similarities. Darwin’s theory gave linguists 
more tools with which to think about language change over time, as having shared 
ancestors, for example, or as evolving faster or slower due to differential environmental 
pressures. Good metaphors that allow scientists to make progress in their fields will tend 
to endure, whereas metaphors that are not ‘good to think with’ will fade away. Successful 
metaphors  also succumb to entropy, but instead of fading away from use they lose their 
‘metaphoricity’.   Over time, novel metaphors lose their novelty and become 
‘conventional metaphors’, those expressions that pepper our speech without reflection. 
‘Dead metaphors’  (to use a metaphor to describe a metaphor) are metaphors that are 
considered by standard speakers to be synonyms of the literal meaning, although with 
some prompting, they can see the metaphor underlying the term (i.e. “it was a very deep  
blue” or “they u sed a crane  to move the bricks” (Deignan, 2008, p. 39). Sometimes dead 
metaphors are only traceable through etymology and, as such, can be called ‘historical  
metaphors’. The word ‘evolution’ is such a metaphor. It traces its roots to the Latin 
evolvere  which meant “to unroll” or “to roll out,” especially of scrolls of parchment 
(Harper , n.d.). When it was first used in the 17th century, it was a novel way to describe 
the progression of something from a simpler form to a more complex form, usually 
applied to embryos as they grew. By the time Darwin used the term (which appeared only 
once in th e first edition of Origin of Species , poetically, as the last word in the text) it has 
lost the metaphorical connotation. Today, most  linguistic theorists would agree that the 
meaning has ‘shifted’ and the metaphorical meaning has become the dominant, lite ral 
meaning, as has the vocabulary that, once applied to biological evolution, now applies to 
language. For most linguists, languages literally  evolve and the process can be considered 
a parallel example to that of biological evolution of a fundamental phe nomenon.

The mapping that occurs between biology and language can be summarized as 
follows , using Aristotle’s original notation when describing analogy : 
 
𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒
𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑠  :: 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑
𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑎𝑔𝑒   
 
When linguists first explored this metaphor, genes had not yet been discovered, yet 
they were predicted by Darwin as a basic unit of hereditability between generations. As 
scientis ts discovered the mechanism by which inherited traits were passed from one 
generation to the next (genes) and their internal structure (nucleotide base pairs), the 
analogy became tighter and suggested directions for experimentation.   
 
𝑛𝑢𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑑𝑒
𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒  ::  𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑒
𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑 
 
Yet even the solidity of the words gene  and species,  taken from what is known in 
metaphor studies as the “source domain” (as opposed to the “target domain” of language, 
the domain in need of the metaphor), crumbles under scrutiny. In explaining how analogy 
works, Aristotle uses these very words with a very different mapping: “ Metaphor consists 
in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else; the transference being either 
from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, on the grounds 
of analogy,” he writes in Poetics  (as quoted in Garett, 2007).  
In 1956, a multi -disciplinary team of biologists, linguists and psychologists 
explained that they “turned to linguistics where… fundamental units organized into a 
system have been firmly established and examined phonological and phonetic theory and 
empirical data on phonetic evolution, searching for similarities with the process 
demonstrated in Mendelian genetics” (Gerard  et al. , 1956, p. 6). The authors propose an 
experimental design where phonemes are examined for random change as nucleotides are 
subject to random mutation.   “An evolutionary perspective seems prerequisite to mutual 
involvement of linguistics and biology; the renewed interest in the origin of language, 
and the comparative study of animal communication, are part of the general renewal of 
evolutionary perspective in anthropology” (Hymes, 1963, p. 97).  
A paper on statistical methods from 2015 makes this comparison explicit: 
“phonemes are the units of sound that make up words and distinguish one word from 
anoth er, just as the four nucleotide bases (A, C, T, G) make up DNA gene sequences or 
the 20 amino acids make up protein sequences” (Hruschka  et al. , 2015, p. 1). The authors 
continue to write that “in a linguistic context, sporadic changes refer to the replac ement, 
over some arbitrary interval of time, of one phoneme in one place by another and are 
analogous to single nucleotide or amino acid substitutions in gene sequences.” (Hruschka 
et al. , 2015, p.  2) 
But there are obvious limitations to such a metaphorical mapping. Under Darwin’s 
formulation, evolution is driven by natural selection which is based on random mutations 
at a genetic level which then confer an advantage or disadvantage on the individual, and 
eventually, the species. But languages, a s we saw with the Cayman Island dialect, 
                                       Technology and Language  Технологии  в инфосфере .

‘evolve’ in ways that depends more on socio -economic factors and contingencies of 
history than they do on random changes in phonemes pronunciation.   The fundamental 
question remains, “What factors shape languages ov er time? And at what level?” 
(Greenhill , 2016, p. 31).  Scientists are thus tasked with probing the limits of the metaphor 
to see where the model falls apart. As a descriptive tool, linguists can map the 
“phylogenetic relationship” between languages and de termine families, descendants, 
ancestors and relatives (Campbell , 2017, p. 1), but the mechanisms that cause language 
to change cannot be ascribed to random mutations.   
Determining the “selective pressures” on languages is a different undertaking for 
lingu ists than it is for biologists examining species. The first issue of the Journal of 
Language Evolution from 2016 summarizes the different hypotheses on how, or even 
whether, linguistic traits are selected for. “If languages do indeed evolve then they must 
show the three crucial aspects of an evolving system: variation of traits, inheritance of 
those traits, and the differential survival —that is selection —of those traits,” the editors 
write. Selection, they argue, might operate at the level of the speech act , not the phoneme, 
or operate to favor shorter words and sentences so speakers can conserve energy.   The 
editors point to effects of group size, notions of prestige and class, the prevalence of loan 
words, isolation from contact with other speakers as vari ables that need to be considered 
under a model of language evolution (Greenhill , 2015).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ONTOLOGY  
As we come back to the forests of BC, we note that the poets have figured out a 
way to subject Darwin’s words to the random vicissitudes of coastal climate. They are 
probing the limits of Sapir’s metaphor that environment can affect language. They blur

the boundary between living things like wasps and humans, and non -living things like 
books and words. If the metaphor of evolut ion that is used to examine language has died 
and become a literal description of how language changes, does it make sense to classify 
language as a non -living thing?   If the pages of the books left in the forest are used to 
create nests, or are decomposed  by worms and mushrooms, are they similarly inanimate?  
Political theorist Jane Bennett  (2010)  calls for an ontological shift away from a neat 
binary between living and non -living things towards a recognition that so -called 
inanimate ‘things’ are complex ‘vibrant’ materials that contain their own “vital 
materiality”. “I want to highlight what is typicall y cast in the shadow ,” she writes : “the 
material agency or effectivity of nonhuman or not -quite  human things ” (Bennett, 2010, 
p. ix). Pine needles, rain, wind, beetles, or the tread on a hiker’s boot are all objects that 
do things to the books in Decomp ; they act upon them, hence Bennett’s frequent use of 
Latour’s term, actants . The words on the pages reveal themselves to be actants in their 
own right , more than just metaphorically alive. They are “non-quite -human ” in their 
agency. “In composing and recomposing the sentences of this book --especially in trying 
to choose the appropriate verbs, I have come to see how radical a project it is to think  
vital materiality ,” writes Bennett  (2010),  “It seems necessary and imp ossible to rewrite 
the default gramm ar of agency, a grammar that as signs activity to people and passivity to 
things ,” she concludes (p. 119). 
As an extension of this ontological shift, Bennett uses an argument, to come full 
circle, from the work of the original ontological trickster, Charles  Darwin. Based on his 
observations of earthworms, Darwin described how they made topsoil and vegetable 
mould, and as a by -product, made the earth habitable for humans. According to Bennett  
(2010) , this frames earthworms as agents who made history, as political beings ( p. 95). 
Worms feature strongly in the pages of Decomp , nesting in the cool gaps under the book 
covers, or chewing through pages and returning the pulp to the forest ecosystem from 
whence it came. Collins and Scott  (2013)  remind us that , “soil is a verb” ( p. 120), and not 
only when it works to make something dirty, but when it acts on objects to imbue them 
with organic matter. This includes the poets themselves. A new “soil ontology” is required 
“requiring that humans be included more decis ively in the concept of soil, that is, as 
members of the soil community rather than as mere consumers or service beneficiaries” 
(Puig de la Bellacasa , 2015, p. 13).  
DEATH  
Lévis -Strauss’ existential melancholy in the face of unstoppable entropy can be 
framed here, dealing as we are with decomposition and humus, as a reaction to death. Just 
as species can go extinct if they are not deemed to be the “fittest” for an ecosystem, so 
can languages experience “language death.” Language death is the endpoint of  a process 
which sees a minority language getting squeezed out by a dominant language (Dressler , 
1996, p. 95). Linguist Nancy C. Dorian  (1981)  gives an example of a dialect of Gaelic 
spoken on the Northern tip of Scotland that is almost gone entirely. Swam ped as they are 
by the English spoken in Great Britain, these previously isolated communities, each of 
which spoke separate a distinct dialect on different sides of a mountain range, are at 
danger of having their differences flattened, crushed by the inevi table roll of entropy 
towards uniformity.

English, the language in which Darwin wrote, is not in danger of becoming extinct. 
Latin, the other language that appears often in the pages of Origin of Species, is dead, but 
did not experience “language death” in the same way that East Sunderland Gaelic was 
lost to its speakers. Instead, Latin was able to reproduce, spawning daughter language s 
that took over much of Europe (Dressler , 1996, p. 195). It might not be around anymore, 
but Latin’s genetic material has survived, heard in the phonemes of Italian and Spanish.   
 
RECOMPOSITION  
For Collins and Scott  (2013) , “words are things we do together” ( p. 123). Their 
experiment in the woods with five sacerdotal texts from the high priest of evolution was 
a cheeky move to remind us of the social communion we share when we use words 
together. Their experiment would have little meaning if it was not documented in written 
(and photographic) form.  In keeping with the theme of irreverence, Scott writes that “the 
pine is mightier than the word” ( Collins & Scott, 2013, p. 132). Sapir would be pleased 
to know that each of these nouns differ from their idiomatic archetypes in a patterned 
manner. From ‘p en’ to ‘pine’ we have a change of two letters but only one phoneme (/e/ 
> /aI/); but for sword to word we only have on e letter removed but experience an auditory 
shift of two phon emes (/s/ > ∅ in word -initial position, and / ᴐ/ > /ɜ∶/). There is only one 
nucleotide in difference between these two pairs of genes.  
The poets piece together the fragments of Darwin’s prose in one final act of 
resistance against the entropy that threatens to unwind us all. Assembling phonemes into 
words and words into sentences are acts of assembly we all perform every day , together, 
battered by wind and rain .
