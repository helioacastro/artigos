Material agency ABSTRACT  
Agriculture is a major source of excess nitrogen inputs into the environment. In Germany ’s Weser Ems region, the 
extreme concentration of intensive livestock farming translates recent improvements in nitrogen regulation into 
a ‘slurry problem ’ that makes manure disposal services increasingly vital for the beneficiaries of an agroeconomic 
production system based on ongoing intensification and externalisation. The paper uses ethnographic research to 
focus on the material politics of different sociomaterial assemblages of slurry. It shows how manure export and 
new technologies to materially transform slurry both facilitate a further integration of livestock farming by in-
termediaries such as nutrient brokers and feedstuff producers. As slurry is mobilised and transformed, the ma-
terial politics of slurry hinges upon shifting material properties and ontological struggles that position slurry 
along a continuum between nutritious natural fertiliser and abject organic waste. While slurry export to arable 
regions is problematically framed as a circular economy approach, the aim to transform slurry instead of 
transforming the unsustainable agroeconomic structure is embodied in hopes set upon ‘full processing ’ of slurry 
into products akin to mineral fertilisers. The disposal of excess slurry eventually depends on both material and 
ontological transformations. Emerging protest against central manure processing facilities shows that slurry and 
its odour make intensive livestock farming a material and ‘sensible ’ presence that can be acted upon politically. 
Embodied reactions and abjections related to this material agency of slurry can potentially bridge everyday 
practice and structural questions of socioecological wellbeing and justice in a more-than-human world.   
1.Introduction: The ‘slurry problem ’: Understanding slurry as a 
naturalcultural material and political matter 
Worldwide, increasing amounts of reactive nitrogen emissions from 
fertiliser use, combustion processes, energy production and human 
sanitation circulate in the biosphere, with detrimental effects on water, 
air, soil and human health (Galloway & Cowling, 2002 ; Sutton et al., 
2011 , 2013 ). Excessive inputs of reactive nitrogen have been identified 
as ‘one of the biggest environmental problems of our time ’ by the 
Advisory Council on the Environment in Germany (Sachverst andigenrat 
für Umweltfragen (SRU), 2015 ; cf. Rockstr om et al., 2009 ; Steffen et al., 
2015 ), where the main source of nitrogen pollution are agricultural 
losses from nitrogen fertilisers, manure application and livestock (Bun-
desministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, 
2017 ). Intensive livestock farming depends on constant influxes of ni-
trogen into local agricultural systems via externally produced foodstuffs 
(Jarvis, 2011 ). While manures can theoretically be used to fertilise crops 
or pastureland, the farmland available in agro-industrial livestock 
clusters is often not sufficient to apply all nutrients locally. Therefore, manure can easily become, in the words of cultural anthropologist Mary 
Douglas (1991) , ‘matter out of place ’. 
The article takes the public controversies related to increasing 
amounts of slurry resulting from intensive livestock farming concen -
trated in north-western Germany as a starting point. It argues that 
through political conflicts and everyday practices, slurry itself emerges 
as a political matter. The political character of slurry depends on its 
social and material relations – the shifting ‘sociomaterial assemblages ’ 
(Barry, 2013 , p. 19) of slurry. Not only has slurry a history as the object of 
environmental regulation (Conrad & Teherani-Kr onner, 1989 ), it also 
has a more active part in the sense that its physical properties and 
changing material character play a significant role in its becoming po-
litical (Bennett, 2010 ; Barry, 2013 ). The very materiality of slurry 
complicates the ongoing attempts of powerful agroindustrial actors to 
maintain the livestock sector in its current form by intensifying exter -
nalisation practices. The article focuses on the material politics of two 
major approaches to handling excess slurry from Lower Saxony ’s live-
stock hotspot region Weser Ems. The first is to accelerate the export of 
slurry (and other manures) to arable farming areas and biogas

2operations located in other parts of Lower Saxony and beyond state 
borders, a business practice that has drastically intensified in quantity 
and radius due to changes in the German Fertiliser Law in recent years 
(Bundesministerium für Ernahrung und Landwirtschaft, 2017 ). The 
second is the material transformation of slurry with processing tech-
nologies ranging from on-site centrifugal drying (to lower transportation 
costs) to central full processing plants (that could potentially allow for 
the recollection of nutrients in a mineral form). 
Liquid manure or slurry is a novel material that is generated in 
increasing quantities due to the intensification of meat production 
worldwide. It can be understood as a modern form of waste (MacBride, 
2012 ), an anthropogenic matter that problematises simple distinctions 
between nature and culture, human and non-human. While it is an 
organic material based on excretions from animal bodies, it comes into 
being only within technologically mediated forms of intensive livestock 
farming. Slurry is coproduced by the breeding strategies, feeding pro-
tocols and housing infrastructures that characterise intensive livestock 
farming, such as the slatted floors and slurry cellars that mix solid and 
liquid excreta. The widespread introduction of slurry practices in the 
second half of the 20th century has changed livestock farming drasti -
cally, reduced the human labour required and allowed for much larger 
numbers of animals per farm (Lowe, Clark, Seymour, & Ward, 1997 ). 
From a more-than-human perspective (Whatmore, 2006 ), slurry 
could therefore be conceptualised as a ‘naturalcultural ’ (Haraway, 
2008 ) material that embodies intensified agroeconomic structures. In 
the case study area in north-western Germany, slurry management has 
become a crucial factor determining the fate of current forms of inten -
sive livestock farming vis-a-vis environmental concerns, mainly over 
local groundwater pollution. In the light of ongoing legal action from the 
European Commission, the German government has been struggling to 
eventually implement a long awaited and deeply controversial overhaul 
of its national fertiliser ordinance. For the incumbent meat industry 
players, these developments now translate into vital attempts to solve 
the regional ‘slurry problem ’ (Hummel, 2021 ). 
Struggles over the material qualities of slurry and its derivates vitally 
affect how this problem and corresponding solutions are discussed in a 
climate of increasing political and public concerns over the environ -
mental impacts of the intensive livestock industry. The article demon -
strates that the changing material properties and representations of 
slurry are part and parcel of its politicisation as a ‘matter of concern ’ 
(Latour, 2004 ; cf. Braun & Whatmore, 2010 ). The ethnographic evi-
dence shows that the practice of slurry transport, which currently forms 
the backbone of intensive animal farming in the case study area, de-
pends not only on a complex and sometimes fragile sociotechnical 
network of slurry banks and contractors, specialised vehicles and the 
resolution of conflicts over exact nutrient contents. Importantly, the 
ongoing struggles over what slurry actually is for differently positioned 
actors, e.g. nutritious natural fertiliser or abject organic waste – the 
‘ontological politics ’, in Annemarie Mol’s (2002) terms, of slurry – also 
play an important role. In order to be applied to agricultural fields 
elsewhere, excess slurry first has to be successfully framed or reframed 
as a valuable organic fertiliser. 
To entangle the sociomaterial networks and categorisation practices 
related to the ‘slurry problem ’, the paper employs a more-than-human 
political ecology approach (Whatmore, 2013 ) that is attentive to how 
the material properties of slurry – its water content, heterogeneity, 
chemical composition as well as the potential transformation of liquid 
into solids – do matter for how slurry is handled both practically and 
politically. Methodologically, the paper builds upon a broad empirical 
basis of ethnographic material collected between November 2017 and 
July 2020 in relation to slurry management in the German state of Lower 
Saxony, which, in its Weser Ems subregion, houses the country ’s largest 
and most dense stocks of pig and poultry. Forty-five qualitative, partially 
structured in-depth interviews were conducted with differently posi-
tioned actors involved and engaged in the slurry trade, such as pig 
farmers (breeding and fattening) providing slurry, arable farmers and biogas operators receiving slurry, nutrient bank operators, logistics and 
agricultural contractors organising slurry transport and application, 
feedstuff retailers, agricultural extension officers, representatives of the 
Agricultural Chamber and the Farmers ’ Association, as well as local 
government, water authorities and water suppliers in both slurry 
providing and slurry receiving regions. In relation to pending proposals 
to establish central slurry processing plants in the Weser Ems region, 
interview partners further included engineers and investors, political 
representatives and citizens ’ action groups. Interview partners were 
selected according to the theoretical sampling criteria developed for 
Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967 ). Interviews were conducted 
in German and partly translated into English for the purpose of this 
article; all interviewee names given are pseudonyms. 
Apart from the interviews, participant observation was conducted at 
conferences, workshops, training courses and round-table events on 
slurry management (cf. Schulte-R omer & Gesing, 2022 ). Here, local 
stakeholders discussed how slurry transport could be enhanced to 
reduce the nutrient load in specific counties, as reported by the annual 
Lower Saxony nutrient report (LWK Niedersachsen, 2021 ). These events 
provided insights into how local actors negotiated apparently irrecon -
cilable objectives, such as maintaining intensive agricultural industries 
while enhancing environmental governance, especially regarding water 
quality. The way some solutions were put forward by central stake -
holders, such as the idea of a ‘nutrient circular economy ’ (see section 2) 
and the material transformation of slurry (see section 3), while others – 
such as reducing stock numbers or a spatial reorganization of agricul -
tural production – were not discussed openly made it possible to also 
gain insights into how the respective ‘slurry problem ’ at hand was 
defined by powerful agroeconomic actors interested in maintaining the 
current production system. In this respect, the analysis has built on the 
observation that suggested solutions always correspond with specific 
problem framings put forward. 
Stakeholder meetings also helped to establish further contacts with 
possible interview partners. A visit paid early on to long-standing local 
‘slurry broker ’ Hein Hellmann proved especially fruitful as he provided 
access to invitation-only events and facilitated contact to members of his 
close-knit network of business partners. These contacts further allowed 
insight into the importance of long-term, personal relations for how 
business is typically done in this region. A research project on manure 
transport and processing carried out, amongst others, by the Lower 
Saxony Agricultural Chamber with the goal to connect animal farmers, 
logistics companies and arable farmers located in regions beyond the 
Weser Ems livestock hotspot was another source of valuable contacts. 
Field research was complemented by compiling a large collection of 
reports and documents, policies and regulations, as well as media items 
referring to slurry management, related problems and conflicts, targeted 
at both agricultural and general audiences. This body of materials has 
been ordered and structured with the assistance of MAXQDA software 
and coded with a focus on the practices, sociotechnical networks and 
social relations of regional slurry management, the discursive framing of 
problem definitions and solutions, such as the idea of establishing a 
transregional circular nutrient industry, and the role of materialities, 
transformations and practices of categorising slurry. The research on 
which this article is built is itself part of a larger and ongoing project on 
the emergence of integrated nitrogen management within global science 
and policy arenas (cf. INMS, n.d.). 
2.Governing slurry in Weser Ems: Framing solutions and 
problems 
The ambiguous character of slurry as both (potential) fertiliser and 
abject organic waste (cf. Kristeva, 1982 ), as both nutrient and pollutant, 
is reflected in the fact that the earliest piece of fertiliser regulation 
introduced in the study area, the 1983 Lower Saxony Slurry Decree, was 
part of the waste law (Conrad & Teherani-Kr onner, 1989 , p. 241; 
Teherani-Kr onner, 1988 ). Writing about the then first nitrate policies in F. Gesing

3Western Germany, Conrad (1990 , p. 556, trans. FG) observes that, ‘[i]n 
contrast to mineral fertilisation, the application of liquid manure, 
especially by farms with a slurry surplus, is primarily waste disposal, the 
costs of which they will endeavour to externalise as far as possible ’, an 
observation also made by Lowe et al. (1997 , p. 19) in the UK. The UK 
dairy farmers studied by Lowe et al. around the same time, however, 
insisted that farm waste and its smell was something ‘natural ’ that 
should be categorically distinguished from pollution caused by indus -
trial activities. A UK Royal Commission set up to investigate the issue of 
farm-based pollution eventually proposed a redefinition of intensive 
livestock farming as an ‘industrial ’ (as opposed to agricultural) activity: 
‘Agricultural pollution was thus not only an aberrant act but also an 
anomalous category ’, Lowe et al. (1997 , p. 59) conclude. The intensive 
agricultural production concentrated in the Weser Ems region of Lower 
Saxony is an excellent example of this relatively new category of ‘in-
dustrial ’ livestock farming and, in this sense, slurry is indeed truly 
‘modern ’ waste (MacBride, 2012 ). 
The county of Vechta – also known as the ‘Oldenburg Münsterland ’ 
together with the neighbouring Cloppenburg district – features the 
highest stock density in the whole of Germany (see Fig. 1). The livestock 
industry has provided an enormous economic prosperity in an area once 
dubbed the ‘poorhouse ’ of northern Germany (Klohn, 2012 ). Because of 
its distinct industries comprising not only feedstuff producers and 
slaughterhouses but also internationally leading companies, producing 
for example stable equipment and manure processing technologies, the 
area has achieved a reputation not only as a conservative stronghold, but 
also as Germany ’s ‘Silicon Valley of agrotechnology ’ (Windhorst, 2004 ). 
As a result of decades of excess manure application on mostly sandy 
soils, the area has also become a hotspot of nitrate pollution. When the 
local water supplier first encountered immense problems with nitrate 
pollution in the 1980s, deeper wells were drilled to dilute the drinking 
water sourced from higher layers (Aue, 2017 ). Some of the near-surface 
water monitoring stations in the area today still document disconcert -
ingly high nitrate concentrations of more than four times the legal 
threshold (NLWKN Cloppenburg, 2019 ). Since water moves about the 
soil very slowly, the effects of past, less-regulated slurry application 
practices are expected to register in the deepest groundwater wells (at 
about 120 m depth) only in the coming decades (local water works 
Managing Director, interview, 17 July 2020). 
Already in 1985, a special report by the Advisory Council on the 
Environment provided a systematic overview of the environmental 
problems caused by intensive agriculture in German, pointing at excess 
slurry application in livestock hotspots as a growing concern (SRU, 
1985 , p. 19). Regardless of the concern over water quality, however, the 
livestock industry in Weser Ems has not been subject to much public 
controversy locally, and the strong connection between the conservative 
party (CDU) and the agricultural lobby on both State and National levels 
has for many years impeded stricter environmental regulations on 
agricultural activities. Only when the EU Commission took legal action 
against Germany and threatened to impose penalties of up to 850,000 
euros per day for the failure to fully implement the 1991 EU Nitrates 
Directive (91/676/EEC), a major reform of the national regulatory 
framework was eventually realized in 2017, with repercussions and 
re-tightening of some aspects still ongoing. The refined fertiliser ordi-
nance which imposed strict limitations on organic nitrogen application 
including biogas digestates and longer retention periods had immediate 
and profound effects on the Weser Ems region, namely on farms with 
high stock numbers and limited land available for slurry disposal. 
Furthermore, the amount of slurry theoretically increased ‘overnight ’, as 
a young pig farmer puts it, because standard calculations for nitrogen 
(N) and phosphorus (P) content were adapted to higher values (J. 
Rehder, interview, 22 March 2019). In effect, less slurry could be legally 
spread on the fields. 
From the perspective of local livestock farmers, this long debated and 
contested policy change therefore translated the ‘slurry problem ’ into 
increasing costs for slurry management and disposal. More than 3.5 Mio tons of manure are currently transported from Weser Ems to other parts 
of Lower Saxony or beyond state borders annually (LWK Niedersachsen, 
2021 , pp. 15f.). Prices for removing slurry from a pig farm in Weser Ems 
have risen to about 12–15 euros per cubic metre. With costs for slurry 
disposal rising, its has become a major production factor, and many of 
the farmers interviewed argued this new economic pressure was 
exploited by political actors to foster a structural and spatial reorgani -
zation of Germany ’s intensive agricultural production system through 
the backdoor. 
From the point of view of the agricultural chamber, the new fertiliser 
ordinance has aggravated an existing imbalance between animal 
numbers and agricultural area, leading to an overall ‘recovery problem 
[Verwertungsproblem ]’ for slurry (Schepers, 2018). Actors with a stake in 
intensive livestock farming tend to frame the problem as a spatial 
mismatch. The German Agricultural Society (DLG) for example asked, 
‘Where to put the slurry? ’ on the title of its member journal in January 
2019 (DLG, 2019), while a pig production trade journal drew attention 
to the missing ‘slurry area ’ (Schnippe, 2017 ). Another widely used 
framing locates a ‘nutrient surplus ’ (LWK Niedersachsen, 2021 ) at 
livestock hotspots, pointing to the significant spatial differentiation 
between areas of concentrated livestock farming in Weser Ems in the 
west, and arable farming in the eastern part of Lower Saxony (Schepers, 
2018). Defining the slurry problem as a matter of spatial distribution is 
closely linked to the envisaged solution: to transport slurry towards 
areas with low animal numbers, such as the eastern Lower Saxony wheat 
belt, and to market it as an economic fertiliser with the potential to 
substitute mineral inputs to a certain extent.1 
Consequently, interested parties from the Weser Ems region refer to 
this practice as to ‘close the nutrient cycle ’ (Arden, Rohlmann, & Broker, 
2019 , p. 1) between west an east, or livestock and crop farming opera -
tions. A flyer of one of the many companies in Weser Ems that combine 
slurry transport with other agricultural contracting services reads: 
‘Closing nutrient cycles hand in hand. We help to close the nutrient cycle 
between farms. ’ (Dettmer Agrarservice, 2019 ). This framing turns the 
role of middlemen – the actors directly benefitting economically from 
slurry transport – into ‘nutrient mediators ’ and crop farmers into part-
ners waiting. At the same time, it neglects the substantive effects of 
nutrient-rich feedstuff imports such as grain or soy on the local and 
regional material flows.2 Thereby it also rhetorically severs the 
connection between the Weser Ems agribusiness cluster and the global 
production networks it is embedded in (cf. Franz, Schlitz, & Schu-
macher, 2018 ). Drawing on a ‘cycle of nature ’ image reminiscent of 
organic and small-scale agriculture, the massive environmental 
destruction and socio-ecological injustices caused, e.g., by soy planta -
tions in Latin America are moved out of sight – and thereby also the 
longstanding political struggles against the externalisation inherent in 
globalized agroeconomic networks. The question if the often quoted 
‘slurry problem ’ is a problem of the material properties, quantity or 
spatial distribution of slurry or rather a symptom of an unsustainable 
agroeconomic production structure is central for the solutions that are 
discussed in more detail in the following, namely the mobilisation of 
slurry and its transformation into fertiliser in material, social and sym-
bolic terms. 
3.Mobilising slurry: Transport from west to east 
In Vechta county, the amount of slurry to be managed has long been 
recognised, also officially, as too large to be applied on local fields alone. 
1 This potential corresponds with the synthetic fertiliser and energy markets, 
which have become even more volatile due to the economic effects of the war in 
Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.  
2 Åkerman et al. (2020 , p. 78) have observed a similar framing in relation to 
the (failed) attempt to ‘close the disrupted local loop of pig farming ’ via biogas 
and fertiliser production in Finland. F. Gesing

4Already before the 2017 fertiliser reform, building permits for stable 
constructions and reconstructions had been subject to farmers doc-
umenting both their available land and a ‘recovery concept ’ for addi-
tional amounts of slurry – in the form of acquisition agreements, usually 
a contract with one of the many slurry brokers in the area. A conglom -
erate of actors has developed over decades to dispose of excess slurry. 
Initially, the slurry was collected in simple slurry tanks and redistributed 
to the neighbouring counties. This practice, which still coexists with 
novel and extended networks, relies on the traditionally tight and long- 
term personal business relations common in the area, such as between 
local slurry broker Hein Hellmann and agricultural contractors who collect, transport and apply slurry. Under the 2017 regulations, this 
practice has intensified and, consequently, larger distances now must be 
covered ‘to get the slurry away from here ’, as a local sow farmer de-
scribes it (F. Breide, interview, 26 March 2019). From the perspective of 
a representative of the Lower Saxony Fertiliser Agency, this meant that 
‘1 to 1.2 million tons have to get out of here [Vechta county] ’ (Round 
Table Vechta, field notes, 10 August 2018). 
Initially, the situation developed into a local ‘transport crisis ’ (Round 
Table Vechta, field notes, 10 August 2018). The crisis materialised 
during the first winter season after the reformed fertiliser ordinance had 
become active in June 2017. The 2017/2018 winter was characterised

5by extremely wet weather conditions in northern Germany. Because this 
limited field application even before the newly enforced retention 
period began, slurry storage facilities reached full capacity, bringing the 
slurry issue also to public attention (Sprockhoff, 2018). While emer -
gency permits for temporary storage were granted by the Lower Saxony 
Fertiliser Agency, others saw a business opportunity to offer unused 
storage space, however small: ‘They called us saying, if you are in need, 
you can bring the shit here, but you have to bring 10 euro extra per cubic 
metre and then you have to pick it up again on April 1st’, a slurry broker 
reports (R. Ahrens, interview, 27 February 2019). 
The transport crisis, however, turned out to be only temporary (H. 
Hellman, interview, 8 October 2019). Lasting effects of it were that the 
radius of transport generally enlarged, and that biogas plants became 
more central players in the network of slurry disposal. A local nutrient 
broker and logistics company estimates that about 80% of the excess 
slurry is still distributed with tankers to adjacent counties up to 
approximately 50 km towards the northeast (J, Laakmann, interview, 14 
January 2020). While the ‘final destination [of slurry] is always the 
field’, as another nutrient broker puts it (M. Teuscher, interview, 17 
February 2020), only 20–30% of the material is applied directly to the 
soil as fertiliser. The rest is first digested in biogas plants and the residues 
are then applied in the vicinity. However, because there is no longer 
enough ‘space’ for the slurry in surrounding counties, which are now 
mostly ‘full’ (J. Rehder, interview, 22 March 2019), the distances 
covered have overall increased. Standard slurry destinations can now 
also be found further along the A27 and A7 motorways (see Fig. 2). 
Actors describe these distances in relation to large cities in north- 
western Germany – slurry is transported ‘until Bremen’, ‘up to Hann -
over’ or left ‘behind Braunschweig’. Until Bremen is described as ‘close 
by’, until Hannover is medium-range and everything else is far in ‘the 
east’. Obviously, the slurry is not distributed within these cities, but the 
slurry transporters use the well-developed traffic infrastructure con-
necting Vechta to motorways and large federal roads (see Figs. 2 and 3) 
that are highly frequented by agricultural traffic, such as transporters 
filled with animals, feed, slurry or food. Distance is relevant here mostly 
in relation to cost. ‘Close enough’ is what is economical from the point of 
view of the livestock farmer and the logistics company for transporting 
slurry with a given weight and nutrient content. 
3.1. The ‘Combi-Liner’ approach: Sociomaterial assemblage and 
economic integration 
Another factor affecting the distances that can be covered are specific 
technological innovations for slurry transport. Richard Ahrens, the CEO 
of the large nutrient distribution company NutriBank, has developed the 
so-called ‘combi-liner’, a truck with two separate compartments: one for 
liquid slurry and one for dry bulk material. Combi-liners are used to 
transport slurry to ‘the east’ and then take a return freight back to the 
Weser Ems region. The return cargo is primarily feed wheat loaded on 
behalf of a local feedstuff producer, and sometimes other materials such 
as gravel for the building industry. The combi-liner approach sets 
NutriBank apart from other local players. Consequently, NutriBank de-
fines itself as a specialist for transregional nutrient export. For them, the 
main business area begins where the range of standard slurry trans -
portation ends: 
A lot is already taken to the local area – for us, the local area is 
actually as far as Hannover, although it’s 140 km from here. That is a 
local area, which is served by normal slurry vehicles. And we 
[NutriBank] start again, from Hannover to Braunschweig, Helmstedt 
– that’s our area [ …]. (R. Ahrens, interview, 27 February 2020). 
Because of the reduced transportation costs, the combi-liners are 
used up to a distance of about 300 km one way (Fig. 3). Max Teuscher, 
who works for a competitor who also uses combi-liner vehicles, explains 
that this limit is due to a ‘technical relation between driver, working 
shifts and the combi-liner’ (M. Teuscher, interview, 17 February 2020). His company operates a two-shift system, and 300 km return plus 
loading and unloading time is the maximum distance that can be 
managed by a single driver within one shift. 
For NutriBank CEO Richard Ahrens, the larger radius covered with 
combi-liners equals a solution to the existing ‘nutrient surplus’ in Weser 
Ems as such. He is convinced that the approach could be scaled up to 
address the issue for the region as a whole: 
There should be maybe 20 NutriBanks, then this would be settled for 
Weser Ems. Then the nutrient surplus would be absolutely reason -
able and properly distributed. (R. Ahrens, interview, 27 February 
2020) 
The quote demonstrates Ahrens’s understanding that the slurry 
problem is a matter of distribution, and not of amount – he sees no need 
for the production system itself to be changed or spatially reorganized. 
His solution, however, not only deals with the difficulties of organising 
an economically viable transport of slurry – a liquid and heavy material 
– via technological means. It also depends on the willingness of social 
actors, namely the crop farmers, to take part in this system as both slurry 
recipients and crop sellers. Part of NutriBank’s success lies in promising 
crop farmers access to the feed wheat market in exchange for slurry 
receival. The wheat market is volatile and very competitive, and feed-
stuff producers in Weser Ems have such strong market power that their 
purchases define maximum achievable prices for wheat in all northern 
Germany (H. Walters, interview, 21 March 2019). Farmers from the 
wheat belt therefore might decide to market some of their grain as feed 
wheat to minimize risk and compensate possible losses from fluctuations 
in achievable prices or grain quality. With the assistance of the combi- 
liner, NutriBank succeeds in connecting livestock farmers, crop 
farmers and feedstuff producers across contrasting interests and ach-
ieves an economically feasible extension of the slurry trade. NutriBank 
uses the combi-liner as a tool to integrate feedstuff producers, logistics 
companies, nutrient brokers, livestock and crop farmers, biogas plants 
and the construction industry into their business network. Such inte-
gration efforts and power concentrations are characteristic for intensive 
farming production systems in general (Hinchliffe, 2015). In this soci-
omaterial assemblage (Barry, 2013) the combi-liner is not only a tech-
nical innovation; it is a sociotechnical object whose material agency 
assembles a whole network of actors, objects and objectives. 
Using slurry as fertiliser elsewhere also requires the integration of 
further infrastructural elements, especially storage capacities, that cater 
for the material properties, regulatory requirements and complexities of 
the sociotechnical network of handling slurry. In this sense, the suc-
cessful mobilisation of slurry also hinges upon the controlled demobi -
lisation of this heterogenous material. For practical and legal reasons, 
organic fertilisers can be applied only during a small window of time in 
spring, weather permitting. The availability of drivers, vehicles and the 
traffic jams often occurring on the over frequented roads are further 
limiting factors. The availability of storage room also influences trans -
portation costs, because if slurry can be delivered outside of agricultural 
peak times, such as in winter, more drivers are available, and costs are 
lower. Plans to construct new slurry tanks in crop farming areas are, 
however, faced with resistance. Legally, the construction of slurry 
storage on farm sites is only permissible if directly related to the agri-
cultural activities, a relation disputed by some local authorities in the 
case of crop farms. Arguably, local authorities are generally reluctant to 
facilitate access for the slurry trade in counties where residents are not 
accustomed to livestock farming, organic fertiliser application is more 
controversial and complaints because of smells more common (A. 
Schmidt, City of Salzgitter, interview, 26 February 2020). While some 
farmers in the east have envisioned shared facilities to split investment 
costs, there is also an unwillingness to financially engage in solving a 
problem caused by livestock farmers elsewhere ‘for them’ (E. Mohn, 
interview, 12 June 2020; M. Tiedemann, Wolfenbuettel county, inter-
view, 24 February 2020). Here, the circular economy framing, allegedly 
reweaving connections between livestock and arable farming, clearly F. Gesing

6reaches its limits. Besides, the dynamic development of slurry processing 
operations makes farmers hesitant to invest. What if full processing is 
successful and the cheap nutrients promised by slurry brokers will arrive 
in a mineral fertiliser pack in the near future? These visions, related to 
transforming the material properties of slurry, will be discussed in the 
following section. 
4.Transforming slurry 
4.1. Material transformation 
To facilitate transport, there are, on the one hand, ‘separation ’ 
technologies used such as mobile centrifuges that extract humidity from 
liquid manure. These technologies, however, address the ‘slurry prob-
lem’ – here understood as the unfavourable relationship between 
weight, water content and transportation costs – again mainly from the 
point of view of the slurry producer or ‘provider ’. The drier substances 
resulting from separation can theoretically be applied elsewhere on the 
fields with a conventional dry manure spreader, while the liquid phase 
remains at the livestock farm. However, in practice, the separated ma-
terials do not allow for exact application on the fields. Slurry broker 
Hein Hellmann envisions crop farmers responding to the prospect of 
receiving separated slurry, telling him that ‘we’re spooning up our 
[grain]stock and you come in here with this crap! ’ (Round Table Vechta, 
field notes, 1 July 2019). Separated material has to be worked into the 
soil and cannot be used on growing stock. Therefore, Klaus Rebmann 
from the eastern Lower Saxony Agricultural Chamber explains, only ‘raw ’ slurry can be used in spring: ‘We could only work with liquid 
manure then. There we know it works [laughs]. Otherwise, we’ll get into 
trouble with our pilot farms, which won ’t work either ’ (K. Rebmann, 
interview, 25 October 2018).3 
To be successfully transformed and then mobilised, the material first 
has to become enrolled into a wider network. Once again, an interme -
diate actor plays a key role, in this case an agricultural cooperative that 
has developed a nutrient disposal service based on separation technol -
ogy. Their ‘all-inclusive solution ’ (H–P. Wichmann, interview, 10 June 
2020) successfully enrols slurry separation into a larger sociomaterial 
assemblage, similar to the combi-liner transport network described 
above. This assemblage is centred around a mobile centrifuge placed in a 
container and driven directly to the pig farms. The separated 
phosphorus-rich dry material is then transported to biogas plants in 
eastern Lower Saxony at a cost of about 10 euros per cubic metre. A 
nitrogen-rich fluid is left at the farm and applied locally. This slurry 
disposal service is yet another example of the increasing market inte-
gration in livestock farming, especially since the cooperative is also a 
major player in the feedstuff market. It also recently started to build a 
digital platform integrating various services, such as the provision of 
localized weather data for site-specific herbicide and fertiliser man-
agement. Such smart farming applications rely on small-grid data from 
farmers. Manure management services again serve as a means to an end, 
in this case as the cooperative ’s investment in future markets in the hope 
of extending their local value chain into the agricultural data business so 
far mostly dominated by multinational companies.

tilisers in arable farming. F. Gesing

74.2. ‘Full processing ’: The promise of moving beyond the nutrient cycle … 
In contrast to the relatively simple separation technologies that are 
embedded into more complex socio-economic networks, ‘full process -
ing’ is itself technically more advanced and provides a more thorough 
material transformation of slurry into dry matter and water deemed 
clean enough to enter on-site pre-flooders. Such technologies can 
operate on different scales, as on-site units located next to very large pig 
farms, or in the form of central processing plants where slurry is trans -
ported to. Plans to establish full processing plants in the Weser Ems 
region can be understood as yet another symptom of the ongoing inte-
gration and intensification of agrarian production. For the agro-
economic livestock cluster, part of the – in Weser Ems yet unfulfilled – 
promise of full processing lies in slurry-turned-fertiliser products that 
resemble mineral fertiliser more closely, and which would presumably 
be of more interest to conventional crop farmers.4 In this sense, full 
processing would add another layer of intensification – the disposal of 
manure replaced by its complete commodification. This vision mirrors 
the ‘valorisation of waste through dynamics of intensification ’ already 
observed by Schlitz (2020 , p. 161ff.) in the context of methane pro-
duction from manure. 
Since 2019, plans for several such facilities have been developed, 
including one by local entrepreneur Eberhard Koerner who emphasises 
that the ultimate goal of slurry processing is to sustain intensive livestock farming and related industries in the region.5 Their loss, he 
argues, would be ‘non-compensable ’ (E. Koerner, interview, 24 July 
2018). Again, local feedstuff producers play a role, investing heavily into 
centralised full processing projects, motivated by their market interest to 
keep local livestock production in its current shape (farmer and politi -
cian B. Fischer, interview, 14 January 2020). Centralised processing 
could also provide alternative options in case of epizootic disease out-
breaks such as African Swine Fever (ASF), when ‘[slurry] export would 
be gone overnight ’ (agricultural lobbyist N. Müller, interview, 2 August 
2018). However, those in the slurry export business consider this only a 
partial solution, a ‘Plan B that will relieve the strain ’ in a situation where 
potential slurry recipients are said to ‘take us to the cleaners ’ by 
expecting an increasing payment in return (Round Table Vechta, field 
notes, 1 July 2019). Full processing entrepreneur Koerner also states 
that ‘full processing ’ does not equal a ‘full solution ’ to the Weser Ems 
slurry problem in his view – even with his goal to process half a million 
cubic metres of slurry per year, the future plant ‘cannot take the surplus 
out [completely] ’, he argues (E. Koerner, interview, 24 July 2018). 
At the same time, the vision he puts forward transgresses the domi -
nant – and deeply problematic – narrative of the current manure export 
business as closing the nutrient cycle between livestock and crop 
farming which he argues ‘is still a mindset in agriculture, especially 
among agricultural functionaries and also in agricultural policy. […] 
They always think in terms of these cycles; everything that is produced 
in agriculture must also end up in agriculture. That is the so-called cir-
cular economy ’ (E. Koerner, interview, 24 July 2018). Contrary to this 
Fig. 3.Longer distances are covered with combi-liner vehicles. Graphic: Lisa Feuchter.  
4 There is a separate market for certified organic manures that has also been 
subject to the research but is beyond the scope of this article. 
5 Centralised slurry processing is not a novel idea. Already in the 1980s, a 
project was announced in the area with a 30 million Deutschmark investment 
volume. F. Gesing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Political Geography 101 (2023) 102832
8framing of a circular economy to be established within agriculture, 
Koerner defines his goal to ‘completely remove/take out an amount X 
from this region and add it to other cycles. And these cycles do not 
necessarily have to be linked to agriculture ’ (E. Koerner, interview, 24 
July 2018). He thinks also of other material flows, such as the chemical 
industry. As a result, he claims, ‘we will have no waste ’: ‘We are not 
building a waste disposal plant but creating a technical solution for the 
nutrient surplus of the region ’ c-Port Zweckverband, n.d.). He conse -
quently calls his planned facility a ‘transformation plant for slurry ’, 
arguing that it will ‘not [be] a profit centre in the classic sense, but an 
infrastructure project for the region ’ (c-Port Zweckverband, n.d.): an 
externalisation of waste turned into economic development. This mir-
rors popular media discourse, where slurry transformation is evoking 
appraisals such as ‘technology turns slurry into black gold ’6 or ‘where 
slurry is gilded ’ (Mlodoch, 2020 ). 
4.3. … but no symbolic transformation of slurry 
The world-making effects of such onto-political statements have also 
been noticed by local residents who became vocal opponents of another 
full processing project. Siegfried Staaken recalls that he first learned 
about the plans to build a facility in his village from a public notification 
in the newspaper:  
It said [ …]: Processing plant. That ’s what it said. There was nothing 
about slurry. A treatment plant [ …]. So, and then we met at a 
neighbourhood barbecue in the summer [and] talked about it. And 
then one of the neighbours said, don’t you know what that is? I say, 
no. What is this? - A slurry processing plant. At first everything was 
quiet. What do you mean, slurry processing plant? And then it was 
discussed. […] And between obituaries and crossword puzzles. 
That ’s where it was at [in the newspaper]. (S. Staaken, interview, 6 
February 2020) 
This proposal by a local technology company was – after initial 
support – eventually rejected by the local council citing the strain it 
would have put on the road infrastructure. Staaken and other residents 
of a neighbourhood of scattered houses surrounding the proposed site 
had managed to mobilize the larger community, and hundreds of written 
submissions were filed in opposition to the project. The action group 
collected information on slurry management and eventually brought 
forward a whole series of counterarguments reaching from increased 
traffic to the threat of spreading multi-resistant bacteria to water 
pollution and, importantly, smell. Reporting from a site visit undertaken 
to a similar plant operating in the Netherlands, Staaken recalls: ‘2 km 
away you could still smell it, where the wind comes from. […] You 
cannot imagine that’ (S. Staaken, interview, 6 February 2020). The 
proximity of houses to the proposed site also provided the opportunity 
for the owners to question the results of a mandatory ‘odour assessment ’ 
commissioned to assess the effects on properties located within a 600 m 
‘odour radius ’ (see also Åkerman, Humalisto, & Pitzen, 2020 , p. 77). 
The local Green Party also campaigned against the construction but 
took a different vantage point, arguing that this approach equalled a 
consolidation – literally a ‘cementation ’ – of factory farming (Bündnis 
90/Die Grünen, 2020 ). They argued the initial land sale on part of the 
council was ‘a fundamental, structural policy decision that paves the 
way for continued factory farming ’ and ‘consolidates the current system 
for the future ’, repudiating the framing that it was simply ‘a normal land 
deal’ (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, 2020 ). Instead, the party related the 
siting discussion to the demand for a fundamental structural change to 
‘another kind of agriculture ’ (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, 2020 ). 
Two points seem important here: firstly, the question of slurry processing makes environmental problems related to intensive livestock 
farming sensible – perceptible, and something to act on. And secondly, 
while they followed different agendas – defending local amenity values 
against increasing traffic and smell on the one hand and working to-
wards a new agrarian structure on the other, both sets of actors – the 
local resident activists and the Green Party – shared a common frame of 
reference by referring to full processing plants as ‘slurry factories ’. The 
industrial scale of these operations then seems able to mobilize resis-
tance against pollution in a way that intensive agriculture itself often 
does not – as if agricultural pollution still remained a somewhat 
‘anomalous category ’ (Lowe et al., 1997 , p. 59). 
It should also be noted that while large-scale slurry processing is 
certainly a ‘“technical fix” approach that subscribes to a productivist 
view of agriculture ’ (Ward, Clark, Lowe, & Seymour, 1998 , p. 1170; cf. 
Iles, Graddy-Lovelace, Montenegro, & Galt, 2016 ), not all technical fixes 
addressing nutrient surpluses are necessarily such ‘end of pipe ’ strate -
gies (Ward et al., 1998 , p. 1076). Technical fixes can also aim at trans -
forming the very corporeality of slurry-producing livestock: to this end, 
the feedstuff industry offers nitrogen and phosphorus (N/P) reduced 
feeding regimes, complemented with various food supplements, that 
directly influence the metabolism and thereby excretion of farm ani-
mals. Focusing on their bodily functions – their digestion, growing tissue 
and excreting surplus nutrients as central parts of the agro-industrial 
network, this approach enrols animals ’ bodies into new sociomaterial 
assemblages of feeding, slurry transport and processing. 
In sum, while full processing might be a promising approach from the 
point of view of both the livestock industry and potential customers 
because it would allow for a material transformation of slurry into a raw 
material and resource for either synthetic fertiliser production or the 
chemical industry, the symbolic transformation of slurry into ‘gold ’ – 
something valuable removed from its context of production – remains 
incomplete and contested. It does not convince other critical actors such 
as local residents and environmentally concerned politicians. This points 
to the crucial importance of the ontological multiplicity of slurry, an 
argument that will be developed in more detail in the following section. 
5.Ontological struggles and material conflicts 
5.1. The waste –fertiliser continuum 
Shifting the focus back to the current practice of slurry transport 
from Weser Ems towards the east, it becomes evident that this also 
builds on slurry being considered as a useful fertiliser in the first place. 
In other words, the practice depends on slurry physically and symboli -
cally covering increasing distances, and successfully becoming organic 
fertiliser elsewhere. The initial motivation for arable farmers to use 
slurry as fertiliser is usually cost efficiency: ‘In any case, it’s a cheap 
fertiliser [which] is delivered […] postage free field edge, at zero price ’, 
a farmer representative from eastern Lower Saxony sums up (M. Wibeke, 
interview, 15 August 2018). Transport and application costs are covered 
by the livestock farmers in Weser Ems. Jens Rehder, a young pig farmer 
describes the increasing difficulties he encountered when organising 
slurry export within his extended network of crop farmers following the 
2017 reform:  
In principle, one had to go further and further. And even then, it 
sometimes becomes already more difficult to get rid of it. Or – 
expensive, let’s put it this way […]. Now when I saw this inner circle 
was full, I had to take the next, bigger distance. Then the people in 
the inner circle here said, oh, if you can pay to go over there anyway, 
then you can leave it with us. But the extra money you’ll have to give 
us, too. […] They just saw the business in it. And then – [he inhales] – 
[they] turned the whole product from a good nutrient to a waste 
product. And that was one thing I didn ’t really like. (J. Rehder, 
interview, 22 March 2019) 
In Jens ’ experience, slurry recipients try to reframe slurry into waste 6 Field notes, Conference ‘Mist! Zu viel Gülle, Nahrstoffe und Keime … 
(Gew asser-) Belastungen und Schutzma βnahmen ’, 23–24 October 2018, 
Loccum. F. Gesing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Political Geography 101 (2023) 102832
9in order to negotiate a better deal. This becomes possible because of the 
ambiguous ontological status of slurry oscillating between potential 
fertiliser and waste. The distinction between slurry as a valuable 
nutrient and slurry as disposable waste is not a stable one – rather, it has 
to be enacted in practice (cf. Mol, 2002 ). Livestock farmers and their 
representatives point out the naturalness of slurry, for example by 
comparing it to an organic diet for humans, arguing that slurry is 
‘wholefood for our fields – there is nothing better because it contains 
everything that our soil and our plants need […]’ (Bischoff, 2019 ). This 
framing of slurry as a ‘complete fertiliser ’ (Bischoff, 2019 ) points to the 
fact that it contains both a combination of nutrients and organic matter 
with the potential to enhance soil quality by increasing soil organic 
matter, water retention capacity and heat stress resilience (K. Schroder, 
interview; Round Table Gottingen, field notes, 1 July 2019). The context 
of production (non-organic) and possibly unwanted organic material 
that could also be contained in the manure, such as bacteria, are not 
addressed. 
These categorial shifts along what could be termed a ‘waste –fertiliser 
continuum ’ go to the heart of the onto-political struggle over slurry. 
Ironically, those actors who face a slurry surplus which forces them to 
invest a considerable share of their profits into costly disposal services 
are also those who are at pains to stress that slurry is a nutritious fer-
tiliser, even almost a gift. They argue that ‘crop farmers demand money 
while getting nutrients ’ (Round Table Vechta, field notes, 10 August 
2018). Seen in this light, full slurry processing is anticipated as a 
transformation of nitrogen ‘in a way that crop farmers take it with 
greatest pleasure [mit Kusshand ] and come to pick it up themselves ’ 
(Round Table Vechta, field notes, 10 August 2018). In other words, 
livestock farmers hope that the materially different products resulting 
from full processing will also have less potential for ontological shifts 
along the waste –fertiliser continuum. 
5.2. Conflicts over content 
Those engaged in the current slurry transport practice hope to enact 
slurry as a natural substance and hence valuable fertiliser. From the 
perspective of a conventional crop farmer considering the use of 
manure, however, it is vital to know the exact nutrient content and the 
ratio of elements contained in the substance. In this sense, the variability 
of an organic substance such as slurry makes it somewhat unreliable and 
unruly. Consequently, the ontological transformation of slurry into fer-
tiliser is further complicated by conflicts over the exact nutrient content. 
Nitrogen and phosphorus contents of organic fertilisers have to be re-
ported to the Fertiliser Agency by both slurry provider and recipient. 
However, standard practice means that the samples used to measure 
nutrient contents are taken by the providing livestock farmer before the 
slurry is loaded and shipped. The material is then received and applied 
by crop farmers before they have had the opportunity to commission 
their own testing. 
Here, on the one hand, the materiality of slurry comes into play. 
Since slurry is a heterogeneous liquid substance containing various 
solids, the nutrient content of a sample depends on how and where this 
sample is taken. The thicker the material, the more nutrients it contains. 
Therefore, when the slurry is stirred before sampling from the tank, 
nutrient contents are much higher compared to a sample taken from the 
upper layers of a settled substance. On the other hand, the contrasting 
interests of the actors involved emerge in the process. For livestock 
farmers, it is favourable to document the highest possible nutrient con-
tent in order to have the lowest possible transportation costs for the 
maximum removal of excess nutrients accounted in their farm balance. 
Crop farmer, however, want as many nutrients as possible in the ma-
terial sense – to have the highest fertilising effect. But, at the same time, 
the documented nutrient content should be as low as possible, because 
the nutrient import adds to the overall fertiliser input that is strictly 
limited and monitored also for the crop farm. In other words, they want 
the lowest possible figures on paper but as many nutrients as possible on the field. 
Conflict resolution often falls upon the intermediate slurry brokers 
who address the issue by both technical and social means. Big logistics 
companies who distribute large quantities of slurry to a spatially 
distributed client base have invested in costly near infrared spectroscopy 
(NIRS) sensors that measure nutrient content while slurry is pumped 
into or out of trucks. Smaller players such as local slurry banks, on the 
other hand, rely on a culture of trust, maintaining personal business 
relationships sometimes over several generations of farmer families. 
They build on the strong local culture of doing business with people one 
knows. This approach, however, is not easily expandable beyond the 
region and to new actors with contrasting interests. 
6.Towards material and sensory politics of care 
The material properties of slurry and the ontological politics of what 
it is or may become – waste or nutrient, fertiliser or pollutant, resource 
or public nuisance – have been shown to be a matter of conflict and 
concern for differently positioned actors: pig and crop farmers, in-
termediaries such as slurry brokers and feedstuff retailers, local resi-
dents and regulators. The arena of onto-political conflicts over slurry, 
however, also includes the wider public. Therefore, the pig farming 
trade journal mentioned above distributes large stickers reading ‘100% 
natural fertiliser – for the sake of our environment ’. According to the 
journal, ‘with this simple slogan on the slurry barrel, the feeder, the field 
container or directly on the slurry storage it should be made clear that 
slurry is a natural product and is needed! ’ (SUS, 2021 ) This comment 
addresses members of the general public, such as the residents of the 
small town of Achim, a municipality close to the city of Bremen that can 
be considered a classic destination for ‘slurry tourism ’ (Purschke, 2018 ) 
from Weser Ems. Some local residents worded a petition in protest of the 
slurry trade, demanding the local council ‘to search for and investigate 
ways to prohibit carting toxic hazardous waste (slurry) from distant 
regions to the fields of the town of Achim under the pretext that it is 
harmless, natural fertiliser ’ (Mix, 2018 ). These statements again locate 
slurry firmly at the waste end of the waste –fertiliser continuum. 
Public controversies about slurry often focus on the matter of smell. 
The extension of slurry transport beyond the centres of intensive animal 
farming has been met with resistance from those who are not familiar 
with this form of production and the odours related to it. Smell can also 
be understood as a matter of material – and sensory – politics. As Lowe 
et al. (1997 , p. 196; see also Chan (2020) observe, before agricultural 
pollution became recognised and eventually governed, only smell was 
seen as a political issue – as a ‘public problem ’ – whereas other aspects of 
farm pollution were framed as merely technical issues. Already in the 
1980s, an award-winning documentary put the ‘eternal stink of the 
fields ’ on the public agenda (Kleinschmidt & Eimler, 1984 ). This smell of 
slurry marks a material presence that remains invisible most of the time 
– even to livestock farmers – as slurry is stored in channels and cellars 
below slatted floors, or closed tanks emptied only by specialised con-
tractors. Nonetheless, volatile ammonia molecules enter and irritate 
human noses and let them experience the materiality of slurry in the 
sensation of smell – an odour that can provoke strong, visceral reactions. 
Bodily waste triggers abjection (Grosz, 1994 ). Stemming from the early 
preoccupation with the boundaries of the body and thereby the self 
(Kristeva, 1982 ), abjection remains an ambiguous sensation throughout 
life that mixes repulsion and recognition (Arya, 2017 ). Drawing on 
Kolnai (2004) , Arya (2017 , p. 54) underlines the ‘significance of the 
organic ’ in defining what is considered disgusting and dirty. She points 
to the ‘presence of the organic and its location ’ (Arya, 2017 , p. 54) as 
that which provokes reactions of stark disgust in encountering faeces 
and other substances that are of the body. Smell threatens the corporeal 
boundaries in a very literal sense when minuscule molecules physically 
enter the sensing body (Neubert, 2020 ).

10the German fertiliser ordinance, smell remains an immediate sensation 
that can be felt directly by sensing human bodies – other than, for 
example, nitrate contamination of groundwater. When smells enter the 
body, they make pollution sensible. The regulation of abject, ‘beastly’ 
smells caused by practices such as inner-city animal husbandry, manure 
storage or slaughtering has been a main driver of what Atkins (2012, p. 
2) describes as the ‘great separation’ of spaces for humans and spaces for 
animals in the changing urban economies of 19th-century European 
cities. This historical example shows that the nuisance of smelly organic 
material is, besides its immediate, visceral quality, always linked to 
specific multispecies relations and production systems (see Doron, 2021, 
p. 26). 
As Neubert (2020) observes in his (auto)ethnographic work in Iowa, 
manure smells different to different people. For some, it is the ‘smell of 
money’ (Neubert, 2020, p. 742) – an effect of habituation but also an 
indication that the connection to economic value may indeed change 
individual interpretations of sensual experiences and that ‘abjection, 
like odour itself, is fundamentally social, cultural and political’ (Neu-
bert, 2020). Also, as has been discussed above in relation to protests 
against full processing, there is not per se a contradiction between an 
embodied politics of the everyday related to smell and political argu-
ments against the power laden and deeply unsustainable structural 
concentration and integration of intensive livestock farming. Abjection 
and disgust can remind us that we are animals too (Arya, 2017, p. 55) 
and can possibly provide an inroad for people to care about the 
more-than-human environment (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2011, 2015). 
Understanding the permanence and pervasiveness of smell connected to 
intensive animal farming as a ‘slow disaster’ can motivate acts of caring 
or ‘slow activism’ (Liboiron, Tironi, & Calvillo, 2018): everyday but 
nonetheless political practices of ‘doing and intervening’ (Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2011, p. 89) that take responsibility for the well-being of the 
more-than-human worlds surrounding and connecting our sensing 
bodies. 
7.Conclusion: Material agency and agroeconomic structures 
To conclude, the case study has demonstrated the ontological mul-
tiplicity of slurry. Shifting along the waste–fertiliser continuum, slurry 
can be different things as it is enrolled into different socioeconomic 
networks and sociomaterial practices. Slurry may become fertiliser by 
transgressing simple binaries of nutrient–pollutant, organic–artificial or 
nature–culture. This potential for slurry to become fertiliser is realised in 
relational practices of producing, transporting and transforming slurry 
materially and ontologically. Ontological struggles over what slurry is 
and may become therefore play a vital part in any technical solution to 
the ‘slurry problem’. There are in fact multiple slurry problems and 
solutions – as there is ‘more than one’ slurry (cf. Mol, 2002). It is a 
production factor that allows powerful intermediate players to integrate 
various agricultural actors into ever more complex production networks 
and to maximalise capitalization, but it is also a public nuisance that 
triggers citizens’ action groups. It can be a means to increase soil organic 
matter that comes delivered to the field for free, and, in the future, it 
might serve as a raw material to extract mineral nutriments from. In all 
of these cases, slurry emerges as a complex material-symbolic matter. Its 
material properties effect and are affected by the larger sociomaterial 
assemblages (Barry, 2013) it is embedded into, such as the transport 
infrastructures and economic networks centred around the use of 
combi-liners, ‘all-inclusive’ disposal services for separated slurry or the 
transformation into the potentially materially and ontologically more 
stable products of so-called full processing. 
The focus on material politics highlights that the more-than-human 
agency of slurry actively affects structural processes, such as the 
ongoing market integration along the chain of production from animal 
feeding to slurry management. Emerging and enlarging networks of 
manure transport reproduce existing agricultural structures and forge 
new connections between actors who share common interests in maintaining intensive livestock farming in its current shape. Players 
such as NutriBank, while claiming to ‘close the nutrient cycle’ between 
livestock production hotspots and farming areas, knit the chain of pro-
duction ever closer. Crop farmers may be more reluctant to join but the 
market power of intermediaries, especially the feedstock market, are 
certainly a strong incentive to do so. The sociotechnical infrastructures 
of slurry transport thereby help to maintain highly intensive livestock 
farming and the associated industries upstream and downstream, such 
as stable construction companies and feedstuff producers based in the 
Weser Ems region. For the latter, the nutrient surplus even provides new 
market opportunities to develop nitrogen and phosphorus reduced 
feeding regimes that directly target animals’ metabolisms and excretion. 
The mobilisation of slurry hinges upon its potential for material 
transformations, since some its physical properties are major obstacles 
for the slurry trade. The hope to transform slurry instead of transforming 
the unsustainable agroeconomic structure is embodied in the promise of 
a future ‘full processing’ of slurry into marketable products akin to 
mineral fertiliser. So far, the complex sociomaterial assemblage of slurry 
from Weser Ems has not been translated into the construction of a 
centralised processing facility, and the very materiality of slurry – 
especially the smell associated with it – might ultimately prove to be a 
limit to this latest attempt to further intensify the production chain to 
fully incorporate the valorisation of waste (cf. Schlitz, 2020). 
In fact, slurry becomes eventually more visible in the context of 
public controversies over industrial-scale ‘slurry factories‘ (cf. Moore, 
2009, p. 435). The successful protest organised against such a building 
proposal shows once again that the envisaged material transformation 
alone is not sufficient for slurry processing to change its ontological 
status from a source of sensory nuisance to a neutral recovery infra-
structure. The fact that immediate, embodied reactions to the smell of 
slurry can trigger such determined public protest further demonstrates 
its material agency. Slurry and its odour can make intensive livestock 
farming – happening mostly behind closed bars – a material, visceral 
presence that is felt most immediately in the sensation of abjection. 
Sensual and embodied experiences such as disgust and abjection can 
then become a vital part of a practical politics of care for a 
more-than-human world (Martin, Myers, & Viseu, 2015) and help 
address structural questions of socioecological wellbeing and hence 
justice (Yaka, 2019).
