There is great diversity in the methods, terms, and empirical focuses employed by
social and natural scientists working on agroecological transitions. The upshot is
that whilst various researchers may nominally be putting their shoulder to the same
agroecological wheel, the impact of their combined efforts is not what it might be.
The aim of this article is to assist in the co-ordination and collaboration of disparate
research activities and actors. It does so by offering the readers of this journal a
user-friendly guide to some of the terms being used by social scientists (particularly
human geographers and anthropologists) in their work on pests, diseases, crop
protections and agroecological transitions. Such a document is of particular use as
the terms and concepts employed by social scientists are equipped to generate
analysis with explicit political insight in a way that those used by natural scientists
may not be. The concepts and theories of social scientists foreground the
commonalities that cut across case studies which might otherwise seem
separated by a reservoir of context speci ﬁcity. Tooled with these terms of
analysis, the promise of agroecology rightly becomes something with far
reaching political and justice consequences. These terms are presented across
ﬁve areas: the ontological, the epistemological, the methodological, the historical,
and the aesthetic. Given the range of social, ecological, cultural, and economic
barriers involved in effecting an agroecological transition, it is vital that different
researchers are conversant in each other ’sl a n g u a g e .

1 Introduction
Due to the diminishing ef ﬁcacy of crop protection programmes predicated on chemical
inputs and the considerable socio-ecological costs associated with their production and
application, there is now major impetus behind the development of agroecological
approaches to pest and disease management. Around the world, biologists, agronomists,
entomologists, sociologists, economists, geographers, and anthropologists are all asking
questions relevant to this transition: how to make pest suppression and disease control an

emergent function of the farm ’s ecosystem rather than something
applied to it in chemical form? And how to encourage greater
uptake of relevant agroecological practices?
There is, understandably, a diversity in the methods, terms, and
empirical focuses employed by these researchers. The upshot is that
whilst various thinkers may nominally be putting their shoulder to the
same agroecological wheel, the imp act of their combined efforts is not
what it might be. The aim of this Perspective Piece is to assist in the co-
ordination and collaboration of disparate research activities and
actors. Given this journal ’s readership, it does so by offering a user-
friendly guide to some of the terms being used by social scientists
(particularly human geographers and anthropologists) in their work
on pests, diseases, and agroecological transitions. Beyond just a general
call for greater interdisciplinary work, there is a speci ﬁcr e a s o nw h yI
believe such a document will be of use in this agricultural context.
Namely, that the terms and concepts employed by social scientists are
equipped to open up room for analysis with explicit political potency
in a way that those used by natural scientists may not be.
Where agronomic and ecological research methods major on
the biological interactions between pests, crops, soils, landscapes,
livestock animals, and farming inputs, social scientists working in
this space foreground the commonalities that cut across disparate
empirical analyses, connecting case studies that might otherwise
seem separated by a reservoir of context speci ﬁcity. This allows, by
way of example, the leaf rust hampering Mexican coffee plants
(Perfecto et al., 2019 ) and the Fusarium Wilt Tropical Race Four
ravaging Filipino banana farms ( Paredes, 2023 ) to be read as
ecological expressions of the same legacy of plantation farming
predicated on ecological simpli ﬁcation and capitalist accumulation.
Tooled with social science ter ms of analysis, the promise of
agroecological crop protection rightly becomes something with
important social, cultural, political, and justice consequences.
Throughout the paper, key terms are presented in bold font.
Each is accompanied with one or two references readers mightfollow up on. The terms are interspersed throughout the paper ’sﬁve
main sections. The list is not an exhaustive account of all the social
science research on crop protections and agroecological transitions.
It has, instead, been curated to re ﬂect areas of emerging social
science research that readers of this journal might be interested in
learning about, potentially as a precursor to more interdisciplinary
thinking. The ﬁve sections are: the ontological (categories to
organise the world); the epistemological (ways of knowing the
world); the methodological (the empirical practices needed to
develop agroecological management strategies); the historical (the
importance of knowing where pests and diseases come from); and
thecultural (the habits, norms, and aesthetics that shape the
desirability of different approaches to crop management). These
ﬁve concepts for interdisciplinary thinking can be seen in Figure 1 .
2 Ontology: categories to organise
the world
What is a pest? The question might seem like an odd place to
start, but when thinking about transitions from conventional toagroecological protections, it is worth giving it some pause. Pests
and pathogens are, from a conventional farming perspective, the
biotic agents that have a detrimental impact on agricultural
production owing to the way they can cause disease. From an
agroecological vantage point, such categorisations are a little less
stable. Pests are only probl ematic when they are in an
agroecosystem (intensive, simple, rationalised) where they can
rapidly proliferate and cause great agronomic and ﬁnancial
damage. Whether something can properly be considered a
problem is, therefore, dependent on the system it is part of, rather
than something essentialised to itself.
This agroecological approach implies a change in pest and
disease ontology (Grix, 2002 ). The term ontology refers to the
nature of existence and the classi ﬁcations around which objects are
organised. The focus on context in agroecological controls might be
described an ontology of relational materiality (Krzywoszynska
and Marchesi, 2020 ). In a relational material approach, the
character and quality of some element in a system (like a
pathogen in a cultivated ﬁeld) is de ﬁned by the other elements it
is surrounded by, and the way they all interact: by its relations. A
biotic lifeform is only problematic if it is found in a highly simpli ﬁed
agroecosystem through which it can run rampant and give rise to a
disease outbreak. If, however, it exists in a system whereby its
proliferation is checked by agroecological diversity and natural
host-predator dynamics, its claim to disease status becomes less
clearcut. For this reason, soil quality, crop rotations, land use
diversity, water drainage are all proper parts of agroecological
crop protection programmes, owing to the way they shape the
context in which some pest exists, and thus the chance it has of
succeeding. No individual thing ‘precedes ’–is bigger than, more
important that, more de ﬁning than –its relations ( Puig de la

Bellacasa, 2010 ). These ideas won ’t be novel to readers of the
journal. The point, though, is that a term like ontology offers a
shorthand for discussing alternative ways of thinking about the
nature of agro-ecological systems and the elements of which they
are comprised.
In the social sciences, these ideas are often used to initiate new
thinking around agency, intelligence, and unity. Complex ecological
systems –like humans, agricultural landscapes, and ﬁelds of wheat –
can be understood as a set of entangled biotic and abiotic factors
(Rose et al., 2012 ). The focus on entanglement reveals how all the
components of a complex system exert their agency and in ﬂuence
on the relationship as a whole, and how all are engaged in their own
world-making activities ( Whatmore, 2002 ).Assemblage thinking
(Delanda, 2006 ) and Actor-Network-Theory (Latour, 2005 ) are
popular ways that these ideas are mobilised in the social science
literature, both in relation to farm management and beyond (see
Müller and Schurr, 2016 for a handy introduction to both). These
theories stand to make helpful contributions to agroecological
transitions, in which pests are managed via intervention in whole
ecosystems (rather than in speci ﬁc unwanted bodies), and in which
greater levels of tolerance is shown towards complexity, variation,
and even the pathogens themselves.
An agroecological ontology also necessitates a change in the way
we think about the space and the movement of pathogens. In
conventional systems, healthy spaces and the desirable bodies they
contain (livestock animals in a shed, cereal crops in a ﬁeld) are
guarded to protect against breac hes of potentially dangerous
pathogens. In agroecological systems, the co-presence of multiple
life forms (both wanted and not) is seen as inevitable. So, instead of
seeking to (chemically) destroy unwanted life on the farm to
preserve the system ’s sterility, agroecological practitioners look to
thwart the progress of a pest by creating an ecological environment
hostile to its unchecked proliferation. Agroecological systems, for
this reason, protect crops and livestock animals via the presence oflife (diverse rotations, biodiversity features, complex soil ecologies),
not just by the absence of the pathogen in question. The borderlines
of conventional and intensive disease prevention systems morph
into borderlands of multispecies contact ( Hinchliffe et al., 2013 ;
Hinchliffe et al., 2016 ); whilst pest and disease outbreaks shift from
ap r o b l e mo f contamination toconﬁguration (Cusworth and
Lorimer, 2024 ).
3 Methodology: science for
agroecological controls
What sort of science is needed to develop and re ﬁne
agroecological crop protections? Whereas controls that are reliant
on chemical inputs have emerged from a research agenda predicted
on target action sites for herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides,
agroecological systems that seek to manage pathogens via
intervention in the farm ’s entire agroecosystem need a different
approach. Their focus needs to be trained on disease implications of
interactions between crop types, tillage regimes, soil, insects, buffer
strips, precipitation, and they must ask how a set of ecologicalqualities can be installed on the farm to frustrate the spread of apathogen. Such methods consider natural host-predator
relationships, soil health, and the disease suppression achieved
through agroecological diversity.
The difference between these two approaches is re ﬂected in the
difference between the terms reductionist and holistic science
(Jordan, 2013 ). Where reductionist methods evaluate atomistic
elements of a system, holistic methods consider the functioning of
those systems in the round. The latter strive to accommodate the
complexity that characterises rich, dynamic, and diverse ecosystems
such as those that installed in agricultural landscapes. Agroecological
research programmes, for this reason, experiment with different crop
rotations, tillage regimes, cover crops etc. over multi-annual periods,
assessing the protections aff orded to crops and animals by
recon ﬁguring the farm ’se c o s y s t e m( Deguine et al., 2023 ).
A relevant body of research is seeking to understand how to
translate (Seyhan, 2019 ) agronomic research into workable
guidance for farmers managing farms out there in the world. To
facilitate this translational work, agroecological research projects
(along with those developing I ntegrated Pest Management
techniques) use working farms like living labs (Mambrini-Doudet
et al., 2023 ), experimenting with techniques that are designed to be
appropriate and feasible for those in the farm sector. There, the
empirical eye focusses both on the pathogen implications of the
agroecological controls being studied, as well as their economic and
yield outcomes. These research variables represent important
factors for managers making decisions about the running of their
farms. They can be used to attend to the political injustices
associated with the economics of farm management; both in
terms of pressure they exert on individual farmers, and as a set of
forces shaping the sector in more aggregate terms.
For a related set of reasons, there is also growing agroecological
interest in peer-to-peer learning. This amounts to a decentralisation
of intellectual and scienti ﬁc authority in the agricultural sector:
away from the R&D departments of large ag-chemical ﬁrms, and
out to individual farmers and cluster groups developing
agroecological controls that work for their landscapes and
systems. Here, farmers and other actors question the utility of off-
the-shelf agronomy advice, and pivot towards considerations of
context-speci ﬁcity and practicability. This contradicts the
universalising ambitions of the Green Revolution, in which
knowledge and best-practice for pest and disease control was
taken to be universalizable and applicable irrespective of location,
context, or history.
This research is working to de-stabilise the socio-technical lock-
inof intensive farming practices. These have bene ﬁtted from decades
of dedicated research and development, have become embedded into
farmers ’psychologies, and have become central to the organisation of
the food system today ( Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009 ).
4 Epistemology: ways of knowing
the world
The term epistemology refers to an account of knowledge
(Moser, 2005 ). The term prompts us to ask questions like ‘how
do we know what we know? ’and ‘how do we produce knowledge? ’.Cusworth 10.3389/fagro.2024.1281393
Frontiers in Agronomy frontiersin.org 03
This section focuses on the e pistemological aspects of
agroecological management and its approach to pest management
and disease control.
Whereas conventional approaches to pathogens focus on the
speci ﬁc lifeforms that are having an impact on agricultural
productivity, agroecological solutions intervene in the
agroecosystem as a whole. The reimagination of the site of action
carries with it epistemological hurdles. Whilst research can clearly
provide insight into the design of effective agroecological controls
(see above), noisy ecological systems like working agricultural
landscapes cannot ever be comprehensively known. For this
reason, any pathogen control intervention might yield unexpected
and deleterious results ( Deguine et al., 2021 ). So, what to do when
information or data about agroecological pest management bottoms
out? How to act under agronomic uncertainty?
Under the agroecological rationale, farmers supplement
scienti ﬁc understanding of pathogens with other forms of
knowledge. Where farmers have worked the land for some time,
they might have an instinctive grasp of which part of the farm is
susceptible to what pest, and what agroecological management
interventions have yielded good and bad results in the past
(Wezel et al., 2020 ). Particularly regarding the long-earnt
familiarity farmers establish with the landscapes they manage,
this knowledge might be described as situated (Lundström and
Lindblom, 2018 ). If the knowledge is less about a speci ﬁc farmer ’s
relationship with their farm, and more about a set of principles and
practices observed within a landscape or bioregion or amongst a
particular farming community, this knowledge might be considered
local, vernacular or, depending on the individuals in question,
Indigenous (Altieri, 2009 ).
Where farming know-how is not reducible to a set of conscious
ideas farmers have about farm management –but where it is instead
felt and enacted through the body –it might be described as
embodied knowledge ( Krzywoszynska, 2019 ). Such bodily
attentiveness is often described as feeding into a programme of
agricultural care (Cusworth, 2023 ) in which managers interact
with the landscape being managed in a more visceral and
emotionally attuned way.
5 History: stories of pests, regimes
of control
Where do pests come from, and what bearing does that have on
the way they are managed? The ﬁrst section on agroecological
ontologies hinted at a change in the way we might understand the
genesis of a disease outbreak (recall the shifts from borderlines to
borderlands, and from contamination to con ﬁguration). Social
scientists working on agroecological controls are also interested in
histories that reach further back in time.
As part of a broad engagement in decolonial thinking,
contemporary socio-ecological crises like invasive species outbreaks
and the rise of pesticide resistance are being linked to the historical
changes in land management actuated through projects of Europeancolonial expansion. The concept of the Plantationocene is
particularly relevant for the study of agroecological protections
(Barua, 2023 ;Chao et al., 2023 ). It seeks to draw attention to the
way plantations have provided both intellectual inspiration and
economic engine for the intensive farm systems that characterise
the food system today. Under the plantation rationale, farmed
landscapes were rationalised and accelerated to produce as much
food and ﬁbre per unit-area of land as possible. The plantation and
Plantationocene terms help connect intensive land management
directives –including approaches to crop protections –forged in
colonial-era projects with those still employed around the world.
Agroecological pest control systems typically seek to re-
establish the diversity manifest in Indigenous or other ecologically
intensive systems to thwart the unruly proliferation of pathogens on
the farm. For this reason, researchers and farmers often look back in
time to pre-modern ortraditional farming systems for instruction
on how to manage pests without excessive reliance on modern
chemical inputs ( Cusworth et al., 2021 ). The plantation thus offers a
socio-ecological counterpoint to agroecological systems, and the
differing ways pathogens are managed within them.
Historical engagement from social scientists working on
agroecological controls and agricultural pest management has also
yielded insight into how pests spread. The process of globalisation
(Janelle, 2001 ;Sheppard, 2002 ) has made the world smaller, more
homogenous, and more connected. The traf ﬁc of labour, nutrients,
seeds, tourists, and agricultural commodities has had particular
consequences for the spread of invasive species ( Barua, 2023 ),
giving rise to a speci ﬁc subset of agroecological approaches to
their mitigation ( Harrison et al., 2019 ;Tataridas et al., 2023 ).
6 Culture: the norms and aesthetics of
agroecological protections
Whilst the desirability of pest controls are primarily de ﬁned by
their ef ﬁcacy, there are several other factors that shape their
attractiveness for land managers. How a farmer feels about their
identities as environmental stewards and/or producers of food, what
they want their farmed landscapes to look like, and what they
believe their farming peers expect from them all feed into their
managerial considerations. Such cultural factors mingle with more
straightforward pecuniary considerations to create a complex socio-
economic nexus of on-farm decision-making.
Social scientists working in this space employ notions of
Landscape orEcological Aesthetics to foreground the way a
landscape ’s visual appearance in ﬂuences how managers organise
and run their farms ( Gobster et al., 2007 ). The productivity and
proﬁtability of intensive farm systems has created a cultural
preference for ecological simplicity, order, simpli ﬁed rotations,
and the total excision of unwanted pathogenic life ( Burton and
Wilson, 2006 ). The desirability of agroecological landscapes
therefore requires a change in the aesthetic preferences of those
in the sector. This will need to include tolerance towards higher
levels of pest abundance, the presence of connected semi-naturalCusworth 10.3389/fagro.2024.1281393
Frontiers in Agronomy frontiersin.org 04
habitats both within and across multiple farms, the existence of
varied crop rotations, multi-cropping systems, fallow land, herbal
leys, and more ecologically complex ﬁeld boundaries ( Jeanneret
et al., 2021 ). For this reason, educational and funding interventions
to increase uptake of agroecological pest control systems are being
designed to blend information dissemination campaigns with a
more diffuse aesthetic and cultural re-orientation ( Klein et al., 2015 ;
Laforge and Levkoe, 2018 ). Greater consumer interest in food
produced through agroecologi cal methods will also create
upstream economic reasons for farmers to (re)consider the
desirability of less chemically intensive pathogen controls.
Social scientists have develo ped conceptual aids to better
understand the forces that shape culturally ladened notions of
‘good ’and ‘bad ’farming. The Good Farmer concept helps
unpack the terms used by farmers to reveal how the decisions
they make are shaped by a range of social, cultural, and economic
concerns ( Burton, 2004 ). If farmers inhabit a cultural environment
that values highly productive intensive systems, then the presence of
‘messy ’agri-environmental features carries with it a threat of
criticism from their farming peers that might deter potential
engagement ( Burton and Paragahawewa, 2011 ). Relevant to
agroecological transitions, recent deployments of the good farmer
concept are beginning to show increasingly positive reception from
farmers towards those providing agri-environmental public goods
(Cusworth and Dodsworth, 2021 ), and the censure they express
towards environmental negligence ( Cusworth, 2020 ).
7 Conclusion
The forces that have produced intensive and chemically
dependent crop protections reach back in time and have
inﬂuenced every aspect of farm decision-making. As a paradigm,
it has shaped how pests are understood, how research on cropprotections get conducted, and how farmers think about themselves
and the landscapes they manage. To catalyse a transition towards
greater usage of agroecologica l protections, interlinking
ontological, methodological, epistemological, historical, and
aesthetic barriers must be overcome . Such a project clearlydemands sustained inter-disciplinary collaboration. This paper
has been written to help facilitate this endeavour.
