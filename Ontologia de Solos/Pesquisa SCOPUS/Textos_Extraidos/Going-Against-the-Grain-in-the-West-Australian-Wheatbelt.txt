Abstract Global food supply chains, we have been told often in recent 
years, are in crisis. How much, though, does this language of crisis—as 
particular, contextual, temporally bound—suffice to describe the condi -

COVID-19 pandemic as a springboard to interrogate a larger set of struc -
tural, environmental and political fault lines running through the global 
food system. In a context in which disruptions to the production, distribu -
tion and consumption of food are figured as exceptions to the smooth, 
just-in-time efficiencies of global supply chains, we examine the pandemic 
not simply as a particular and acute moment of disruption but rather as a 
lens on a deeper, longer set of structural processes within which disruption 
is endemic. At a time when it is more likely to be grasped in terms of

speculative investment than as a common good, food offers a vital prism 
for grappling with the logics by which power circulates in the world. 
Attending to this constellation of forces calls for attention to supply chains 
as key mechanisms in the organization of the capitalist food system but 
also demands that we extend our thinking beyond the bounded linearities 
of supply chain models.
Keywords  Capitalist food system • Crisis • Disruption • Supply chains 
• COVID-19 • Regeneration
Global food supply chains, we have been told often in recent years, are in 
crisis. Beginning in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic’s myriad 
impacts on human life included dramatic and far-reaching disruptions to 
global food systems. Border closures triggered critical labour shortages for 
crop harvesting; outbreaks of infection spread through abattoirs and pro -
cessing facilities; panic buying cleared supermarket shelves; the precarious -
ness of hospitality and gig-economy work was amplified. Now, as this 
book goes to press, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is prompting new warn -
ings of crisis, with delays, price-hikes and shortages in the global food 
supply chain forecast as oil and gas prices rice and as access to the Russian 
raw material exports needed for the production of fertilizers plummets. 
Speaking to the BBC, head of global fertilizer corporation Yara 
International has declared, “For me, it’s not whether we are moving into 
a global food crisis—it’s how large the crisis will be” (Simpson, 2022 ). 
How much, though, does this language of crisis—as particular, contex -
tual, temporally bound—suffice to describe the conditions of the present? 
In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has also been clear that the 
virus’ spread exposed fault lines that run farther and deeper than the cir -
cumstances of the pandemic itself, highlighting the nature of a global food 
system that both relies upon and reproduces acute inequalities of risk, 
vulnerability, hunger, wealth and power. To this end, the pandemic 
revealed the global food system as not simply in a state of particular and 
acute disruption but rather as itself inherently disruptive—of human lives 
and flourishing, of relationships between people, places and ecologies.
This collection of essays takes the upheaval of the pandemic as a spring -
board from which to interrogate a larger set of structural, environmental 
and political fault lines running through the global food system. In a con -
text in which disruptions to the production, distribution and consumption  M. HINKSON AND V. STEAD

of food are figured as exceptions to the smooth, just-in-time efficiencies of 
global supply chains, the chapters that follow examine the pandemic not 
simply as a particular and acute moment of disruption but rather as a lens 
on a deeper, longer set of structural processes within which disruption is 
endemic. Here, as Alex Blanchette describes in the Afterword to this col -
lection, drawing on Victoria Stead and Kirstie Petrou’s chapter, the global 
food system is one constantly scrambling to patch the very cracks and 
weaknesses it reproduces. Similarly, while we do attend here to the various 
expressions and temporalities of crisis in this system, we heed those who 
have cautioned of the immobilizing and obfuscatory framings of “crisis” 
as exception (Roitman, 2014 ). The vulnerabilities and inequalities pro -
duced as part of business-as-usual in the global food system have been 
intensified and rendered newly visible by COVID-19, but this intensifica -
tion has also shone new light on transformational possibilities.
Extending beyond the bounded linearities of supply-chain models, 
there is a complex constellation of forces that traverse and govern food 
systems, from the transnational workings of UN, World Trade Organization 
and European Union committees to the accelerating influence of transna -
tional agri-investors; to the industrialization of production and pressures 
to intensify and expand the scale of farming; to the fragility of migrant 
labour markets exposed by prolonged international border closures; and 
the determined push-back of small-scale regenerative farming, food sover -
eignty and cooperative movements. Threading through all of these inter -
secting issues is a set of intensifying pressures associated with environmental 
destruction, loss of biodiversity and the complex of impacts associated 
with climate change, rising temperatures and unreliable water supply—all 
of which are forcing growers and policymakers alike to confront the need 
for change.
To grasp the food system in its complexity forces us to confront funda -
mental questions, including, for example, whether the farm is the logical 
place to start any enquiry in relation to food. Or, in other words, where do 
supply chains begin? And (where) do they end? In asking such questions, 
this collection seeks to speak with, and build upon, the critical scholarship 
of Anna Tsing on “supply chain capitalism” and others who have similarly 
drawn attention to the cultural and political logics within which supply 
chains and capitalist value are necessarily embedded (Bear et al., 2015 ; 
Tsing, 2009 , 2016 ). However, we also seek to extend beyond the supply 
chain frame—in its critical as well as traditional modes—to the sprawling 
constellations of power, materiality and entangled life that necessarily 1 INTRODUCTION: BEYOND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS

exceed it. At a time when food is more likely to be grasped in terms of 
speculative investment than as a common good, this book proposes it as a 
vital prism for grappling with the logics by which power circulates in the 
world. Attention to food—along the supply chain, and beyond its edges—
sheds light on the complex workings and failures of colonial capitalism, on 
escalating climate change, on the reproduction of hunger and structural 
exclusion, and on alternative regimes of value that would anchor food and 
feeding firmly back on the ground.
This collection of essays has its origins in a workshop sponsored by the 
Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and co-hosted by the Alfred 
Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation, Deakin University and 
the Institute of Postcolonial Studies, Melbourne, in June 2021, in the 
midst of an extended COVID-19 lockdown. The pandemic has been, 
then, both an empirical touchstone for the collection and the context 
within which the chapters were produced. Most contributions engage the 
pandemic directly; some take other of the food system’s disruptions as 
their focus. They are grouped under four themes.
“Foundations” includes this introductory overview, which is followed 
by Lauren Rickards and Melinda Hinkson’s exploration of global supply 
chains as artefacts of distinctive social formations and conduits of colonial 
capital power. Supply chains are, they argue, ultimately disruptive mecha -
nisms that separate people from places, from each other and from the very 
idea of the production of food for nourishment. Sarah Ruth Sippel’s read -
ing of the recent boom in agri-investment then offers another perspective 
on the underpinnings of contemporary, global food relations. Tracking 
patterns of investment with origins in the 2007/08 financial crisis, Sippel 
shows how the “winners” from that crisis are now consolidating their 
power, and profits, through the pandemic.
“Production” opens with Victoria Stead and Kirstie Petrou’s examina -
tion of the pandemic’s disruptive impact on labour in the Australian hor -
ticultural industry. They show that attempts to deal with a shortage of 
seasonal workers resulted in a paradoxical entrenchment of uneven distri -
butions of precarity, risk and vulnerability along the fault lines of race and 
migration status. Kelly Donati, working in the Western Australian wheat 
belt, and Daren Shi-Chi Leung in southern China provide compelling case 
studies of transformational farming projects across scale that draw cre -
atively on diverse regenerative and traditional agrarian techniques. Both 
cases suggest cautious optimism, revealing considerable scope for creative  M. HINKSON AND V. STEAD

working with, and pushing back against, the organizing logic of global 
capital.
The chapters gathered under “Distribution” explore instances of the 
pandemic’s impact on food supply and accessibility. Matthew Henry and 
Carolyn Morris unpack the “crisis” of essential food shortages. Through 
case studies of disrupted supplies of pork and flour in Aotearoa New 
Zealand, they expose the fantasies of logistics through attention to the 
social, material and affective liveliness of actual substances. Maggie 
Dickinson analyses the United States’ mass mobilization of food-aid pro -
grammes, demonstrating that in the face of escalating unemployment and 
life-threatening risks for frontline food workers, hunger continues to be 
used to entrench unsafe working situations that prop up a racist and eco -
logically destructive food system. David Boarder Giles presents an inti -
mate perspective on the pandemic supermarket through ethnographic 
attention to the labour undertaken by essential workers in an inner-city 
independent grocery store. His chapter casts light on the supermarket as 
at once a definitive node of the global food supply chain and a key site for 
the expropriation, circulation and accumulation of surplus value.
In the final section, “Food Politics”, Jon Altman and Francis Markham 
take us to the remote Indigenous communities of northern Australia, 
where a food security “crisis” is shown to be primarily an artefact of gov -
ernment policies designed to punish the poor and push remote- community 
residents to urban centres. Government responses to the pandemic para -
doxically offered a reprieve for these exceptionally governed citizens and 
hence shed light on the basic structural reforms that could readily alleviate 
hunger and misery into the future. Tomaso Ferrando takes us to the UN 
Food Systems Summit, where transnational corporate actors intervene 
with state support to distance peasants, Indigenous communities and citi -
zens from vital decisions in relation to global agriculture. Finally, we move 
from the theatre of the UN to quotidian experiences of consumption, 
where Christopher Mayes and Angie Sassano critically explore the limita -
tions of consumer-food-ethics campaigns. The collection is rounded out 
by Alex Blanchette’s Afterword. In reflecting upon the ever-compounding 
brutalizing history of agricultural capitalism, Blanchette draws on the con -
cept of “temporary measures” as a way of coming at the “non- 
transformational upheavals” upon which contributors to this collection 
reflect. Drawing on the work of Silvia Federici, and her rejection of the 
characterization of capitalism as a historical break with feudalism, 
Blanchette offers the ultimately hopeful vision of capitalism itself as a 1 INTRODUCTION: BEYOND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS

temporary measure—one of many patches on the structural weaknesses of 
the global food system and the relations of power it embodies. So con -
ceived, this temporary measure might yet be overcome by people in the 
pursuit of fuller visions of nourishment and vitality, through a profoundly 
different set of attitudes to the production of food and practices of feeding.

Supply Chains as Disruption
Lauren Rickards and Melinda Hinkson
Abstract In this chapter, we explore supply chains with an interest in the 
complex conjunctions of practice, values and effects that their underpin -
ning modernist imaginary of “seamless circulation” precludes from view. 
The agricultural landscapes of northwest Victoria provide a compelling 
vantage from which to ground truth and trouble the idea of seamless cir -
culation and relatedly the idea that disruptions are merely technical blips 
in otherwise well-oiled machines. Working between the interpretive lenses 
of Anna Tsing and Bernard Stiegler, supply chains emerge as artefacts of 
distinctive social formations, conduits of colonial capital power, and ulti -
mately distancing mechanisms that separate people from places and each 
other. Yet supply chains are also imperfect and incomplete in their opera -
tions, and it is this observation that provides for creative responses and the

In the ShadowlandS  of Supply  ChaInS
Driving through northwest Victoria in late summer, you will encounter 
endless horizons of thick green and white plastic sheeting rolled out across 
rows of vines, protecting first-class table grapes from the remote but con -
sequential possibility of hail. Expensive and unwieldly, not to mention 
environmentally unfriendly, this prophylactic securitization of grapes is 
viewed by (large) farmers as an increasingly necessary protection against 
the risk of damaged crops and resultant drops in their price. Across this 
landscape, there are many such techniques to guard against risks. These 
risks extend beyond those communicated with growing urgency by cli -
mate scientists. They are mediated and created by markets and their 
broader political economies.
There are many recent incidents across this landscape of farmers plough -
ing fully ripened crops and the related financial investment back into the 
earth. In one case, 40 acres of celery was sacrificed, as no pickers were 
available to harvest the crop at a fee that would make the process profit -
able. In another, a plantation of watermelons met the same fate when the 
large supermarket to whom the farmer was contracted suddenly dropped 
its purchasing price by 50 per cent in response to an unseasonably cool 
summer—consumer interest in the fruit had plummeted, yet there was no 
change in the shelf price. In another case, crops of oranges had been 
downgraded, diverted to juice as a result of skin discolouration caused by 
wind rubbing fruit against fruit. According to Australia’s National Crop 
Loss Register, 85,000 agricultural businesses reported significant crop 
losses within a few months of COVID-19 arriving. Millions of dollars’ 
worth of crops were left rotting in the fields (Liveris, 2020 ), rendering 
worthless and invisible the huge amounts of water, fertilizer, and pesti -
cides invested in them and the large environmental costs imposed in 
their name.
In the wheat-belt area, pesticides are an especially key input in most 
cropping systems, particularly given the turn to water-saving but synthetic 
chemical-reliant “no-till” cropping systems. The main active chemical is  L. RICKARDS AND M. HINKSON
11
glyphosate. Despite being the focus of various lawsuits about its deadly 
health and ecological impacts, glyphosate remains a basic ingredient of 
pesticide mixes, with two-thirds produced en masse  in specialized indus -
trial manufacturing zones in China, like many of the chemicals that 
Australian industries are reliant on (Productivity Commission, 2021 ). 
Chinese glyphosate factory production was disrupted by COVID-19’s 
effects on the upstream production of raw materials (e.g. glycine), labour 
shortages and transport blockages, right when Australian farmers’ desire 
for it escalated as favourable post-drought rainfall fuelled their optimism 
about the next season. Desperate searches to source it led to many farmers 
paying sky-high prices (McNaughton, 2020 ). Invisible to most of us, this 
disruption of crop inputs was one stark reminder of the many long, hid -
den, just-in-time supply chains that Australian agriculture is reliant on and 
vulnerable to. Seemingly a “black swan” event, the pandemic has made 
visible threatening possibilities previously unimagined.
At least, that is how it appeared. While the pandemic has indeed awo -
ken urban public awareness of supply chain disruption, for farmers and 
others in Australian agriculture the assumption that supply chains flow 
smoothly and securely has never held. For those supplying Australia’s 
highly concentrated and export-oriented agricultural markets, supply 
chains are as much a fickle master as they are a benevolent servant. The 
small vignettes rehearsed above might be interpreted as disruptions, but 
we offer them as indications of the kinds of rupture that are endemic to 
the Australian agricultural system—the small sacrifices required on a daily 
basis in Australian farming to ensure the pre-eminence of global supply 
chains. In this chapter, we approach supply chains as complex conjunc -
tions of practice, values and effects that their underpinning modernist 
imaginary of “seamless circulation” precludes from view.
SCalIng
Central to the sociological significance of global supply chains is their 
ambitious reach and scale (Tsing, 2012a ). As Anna Tsing argues, scalabil -
ity is “the ability to expand—and expand, and expand—without rethink -
ing basic elements”. Like a house of mirrors, scalability “allows us to see 
only uniform blocks, ready for further expansion” (Tsing, 2012b ). But 
behind its endless refractions, scalability is characterized by sharp differen -
tiations and divisions, “a triumph of precision design” (Tsing, 2012b , 
p. 143). Only very carefully selected parts of the world are allowed into 2 SUPPLY CHAINS AS DISRUPTION 
12
the enclosed chains of connectivity that whisk their offerings through 
blanked landscapes, towns and seas to the next special destination, leaving 
the unchosen to only watch the constant stream of B-double trucks, planes 
and ships. Scalability is a triumph precisely because it differentiates itself 
from the myriad singular, non-scalable biological, cultural and social forms 
that otherwise make up the diversity of the world (Tsing, 2012a ).
How scalability is done and how supply chains are constructed across 
borders is itself diverse, with fine-grained qualitative distinctions charac -
terizing the choices and transactions made. Deeply cultured relations dif -
ferently organize reciprocal exchanges, trade routes and circuits of goods. 
For example, British  supply chains of green beans privilege homogeneity 
in beans, whereas French  ones privilege regional distinctiveness in beans 
(Freidberg, 2004 ). Whether British or French, the national identity of 
such chains refers to their consumer and corporate base, not their spatial 
extent. Each supply chain retraces colonial passages and reinforces the 
magnetic pull of resources and capital to the Global North. As Tsing 
observes, far from being new or modern, the ideal of scalability originates 
in the sixteenth-century plantation and the racialized forms of disposses -
sion and labour exploitation upon which it turned (and continues to turn): 
slavery (Tsing, 2012a ). Colonization was a process of establishing, secur -
ing and scaling supply chains. These chains are thus an artefact and a vehi -
cle of colonial capitalism, remaining today, beneath their shiny digital 
signs, what Chickasaw scholar Jodi Byrd ( 2011 ) might describe as the 
transit of empire .
As much as colonizing spaces, supply chains have colonized minds. 
Today the ideal of linking into international markets remains a common 
marker of success in modern business. Here, the appeal of finely threaded 
supply chains snaking horizontally across the world merges in the mind 
with the ideal of jumping scales from local to national to global, even to 
universal. How to take innovation “to scale” is a profitable new area of 
expertise. Farmers are targeted as not just potential adopters of the vision 
but potential consumers of the myriad tools and technologies that promise 
to help them scale their own businesses, from the precision agricultural 
machinery that allows them to carve paddocks into laser-graded units, to 
the smart farming sensors that monitor soil moisture from outer space, to 
the phone apps that report real-time movements in commodity prices and 
shipping containers, to the banking credit that can fund it all, for a fee. 
Governments are also targeted, in recognition that scaling out across the 
farming population requires “scaling up” the right settings into policies,  L. RICKARDS AND M. HINKSON

structures and decision making, cultivating a regulatory environment and 
innovation system conducive (only) to the right types of suppliers 
and buyers.
dIfferentIatIng
Scaling is not only about homogenization. To create the gradients along 
which capital and goods flow, heterogeneity is essential. Supply chains, 
then, are not just about connection; they are about “difference-in- 
connection” (Tsing, 2016 ). They generate “global integration, on the one 
hand”, and “diverse niches, on the other” (Tsing, 2009 ). Crucially, such 
diversity is not celebrated for its own sake; it is ranked and used to fuel 
competition. The products, suppliers and areas ushered into global supply 
chains are not selected by their absolute characteristics but by their relative  
ones—they are the ones that are favoured at that particular moment in 
time. Although other places, products and people are simply blanked out 
in depictions of supply chains stretched purposively across the globe, they 
lurk in background calculations of possible future options, a reminder to 
the linked-in few to keep performing. If one is unable to deliver products 
on time and to a set standard, it places one’s future  as well as one’s imme -
diate income at risk because it marks one as unreliable. If a buyer has to go 
elsewhere for a product, even for a short-term disruption, there is no guar -
antee they will return.
Reflecting the nation’s colonial roots, Australia has long taken pride in 
exporting goods to overseas consumers, as if others’ acceptance of our 
material offerings signals a far deeper belonging than just inclusion in a 
supply chain. Underpinning such a preoccupation are abstract modernist 
notions of global prestige and international competition. For countries 
such as Australia (or, as Ilppo Soininvaara discusses, Finland) that are 
somewhat unsure of their global standing, such an imaginary drives a 
fierce ranking of subnational regions, determining which parts of the 
nation are considered the “key national spaces … where global competi -
tiveness is performed” (Soininvaara, 2021 , pp. 10, 11). The resultant spa -
tial hierarchies reflect and attract the paths of global supply chains. They 
also reflect urban-centrism, which remains the telos of virtually all such 
chains. In contrast, rural regions are frequently cast as “troublesome 
spaces”, with few managing to secure global recognition or the attention 
of international investors or suppliers (Soininvaara, 2021 ). Rural areas’ 
failure to secure reliable labour perpetuates the image of them as 2 SUPPLY CHAINS AS DISRUPTION 
14
undisciplined and unappealing, both to workers and to those who might 
enter contractual agreements with businesses in the area. Supply chains, 
Tsing reminds us, are about discipline —of suppliers, workers, logistics and 
natures. Those who resist or fail to perform risk being quickly replaced. 
For Australia—that want-to-be island of the Global North within the deep 
Global South, a nation whose productive capacity has been underpinned 
by “capital in-flows” from distant shores for over 200 years (Black et al., 
2017 )—the fear of “capital flight” and the abandonment it represents are 
visceral.
revaluIng
Increasingly, the value afforded a commodity, business, property or region 
depends less on its productive capacity or physical merits (even its relative 
ones) and more on the mysterious whims of the financial world. The magi -
cal touch of finance has spread across the globe like a contagion, drawing 
and continually redrawing global supply chains as powerfully as any etched 
colonial trade route. Referred to by some as a second wave of coloniza -
tion, this financial capitalism has financialized myriad aspects of agricul -
ture. By financialization, we mean here the strategy of “profiting without 
producing” (Lapavitsas, 2013 ) by exploiting interest rates in loaning and 
reloaning “fictitious capital”: “money that is thrown into circulation as 
capital without any material basis in commodities or productive activity” 
(Harvey, 2006 , p. 95). Agricultural products are now not only commod -
itized (i.e. reduced to their market exchange value and sold as one com -
modity among others—turning food into widgets, as one of our 
interviewees put it); they have also been colonized by parasitical financial 
products such as “wheat futures” that put the commodities “in play” in 
the global economy and in doing so tie their exchange value to innumer -
able and untraceable financial transactions around the world, twisting and 
contorting the relationship between their price and the on-ground con -
texts that produced them. In this way, agricultural production and supply 
chains have been distorted to supply profit, not food.
Inputs right along agri-food supply chains have been financialized 
(Clapp, 2014 ), including water and water infrastructure. For example, 
whether and how London’s water infrastructure provides “for actual 
needs”—that is, provides potable water to residents—has become less rel -
evant to the company in charge (Thames Water) and its myriad owners 
(first, Australia’s Macquarie Bank, now various sovereign wealth and  L. RICKARDS AND M. HINKSON
15
pension funds in Canada and elsewhere) than whether its future revenue 
flows can be bundled up as “securities” and sold to other financial actors 
(Loftus et al., 2019 ). In this way, the “illiquid assets” of water infrastruc -
ture have been turned into “liquid forms” in a financial sense (Pryke & 
Allen, 2019 , p. 2), embedding water infrastructure into a “supply chain” 
that has little to do with supplying water and everything to do with sup -
plying financial returns.
In the 2008 Global Financial Crisis when the whole overheated web of 
promises, wishes and transactions came crashing down, the “solid” char -
acter of farmland gained appeal as an apparently safe haven for flighty capi -
tal (Ouma, 2020 , p. 67). Through ongoing “moral struggles” about its 
inherent values (Ouma, 2020 , p. 66), farmland has been turned into a 
new asset class and bestowed with “legitimate financial worth”. In the 
process, rural and remote areas have been cast once again as a new frontier 
and a target for investment and speculation. Some of the swelling cohorts 
of new agri-investors target the distant high-risk environment of the 
Global South, where farmland can be made fresh out of forest or waste -
land. Others prefer the slightly slower profits but greater security of more 
established contexts such as Australia (Sippel, 2018 ). To help things along, 
the Australian government ( 2021 ) aggressively markets Australian farm -
land to investors (e.g. see the new Why Australia: Benchmark Report 2021  
by Austrade). Partly as a result, over the last decade, Australian farmland 
value has become “red hot” among international investors (Tracey, 2020 ).
Foreign investment is spreading into conventional family farming dis -
tricts and through the supply chain to processors, packers, distributors. It 
is also flowing through the financial supply chain to insurance companies, 
who offer to offset the risk at every turn, all the while becoming large 
holders and managers of farmland themselves. All farmland investors are 
seeking scale, consolidating farm properties into larger and larger parcels. 
In doing so, the aggregate value of the parcels begins to approximate the 
smallest financial units that investment firms are accustomed to dealing 
with (Fairbairn, 2020 ), the farm operations become more scalable , and the 
farms begin to attract government-subsidized infrastructure.
Whether foreign or Australian owned, much agricultural production 
today occurs in distinctively corporatized arrangements, whereby owners 
outsource the production to managers, who in turn tend to outsource 
most of the practical work to others. This commodification of labour 
means that those involved are often relatively disconnected from the land, 
upon which they work but do not live; they are employed to make 2 SUPPLY CHAINS AS DISRUPTION 
16
market-driven decisions, and they work to maximize profits. It is part of a 
deliberate strategy of achieving consistency across corporate holdings, 
uncontaminated by local environments, communities and their predilec -
tions. As Anna Tsing notes, such self-containment is core to scalability—to 
being able to “expand without changing”, moving “from small to large 
without redoing the design”, thanks to avoiding relationships and their 
threatening transformative potential (Tsing, 2012b , p. 145).
Infrastructure is another tool of standardization and expansion, allow -
ing supply chains to circulate through farms more swiftly and purposively. 
On-farm infrastructure also serves another purpose, allowing capital  to 
circulate and accumulate in farms more swiftly. Reflecting the hegemonic 
real estate mantra about capital flowing to the “highest and best use” 
(Fairbairn, 2020 ), farmland increases in value as it is “improved”—for 
example, made more productive and standardized through the addition of 
new digital agriculture technologies or cavernous sheds. Irrespective of 
whether such improvements pay off in more profitable production, the 
financial value of “capitalized” land tends to appreciate, providing inves -
tors with their returns on investment and adding to agriculture’s appeal as 
a new asset class. High land values tend to have a “neighbourhood effect”, 
adding value to a general region or even nation. They also attract more 
middle players, keen to facilitate the supply of land into the market, 
for a fee.
All of this interest and interference in agriculture from non-agricultural 
players adds enormous uncertainty to farmers’ decision-making. No lon -
ger can prices be anticipated using common-sense logics; more factors 
than are calculable are involved. In paying attention to what farmers do 
and what they say, we glimpse diverse approaches, some of which feel akin 
to walking a tightrope. Some of those who stay in the game do so by “run -
ning to stand still”, securing a position that might be characterized as just 
beyond hanging on. They are aware that they do their work on constantly 
shifting ground. It is what anthropologist Henrik Vigh ( 2009 ) describes 
as “motion squared”, whereby everything is in a state of motion and vola -
tility, with farmers sharply aware of the constantly intensifying pressures 
on their margins and the risk of obsolescence.
Others are keenly aware of farmers’ uncertainty and pressures. 
Numerous consultants and digital “decision support tools” offer to help 
farmers through the maze, while many investment companies offer to 
relieve farmers of stress by buying them out and reinstating them as a farm 
manager. But many Australian farmers are determined to remain owners  L. RICKARDS AND M. HINKSON
17
themselves. The country’s record land prices reflect not just foreign inves -
tors seeking properties to purchase but Australian farmers taking more risk 
to buy more land. As a rural banker noted recently, many are suffering 
from FOMO: “People are realising that they’ve just got to act now, 
because that parcel of land may not be available for a substantial period of 
time” (Jasper, 2021 ). Crucially, increasing farmland value underpins the 
equity calculations that banks use to offer farmers more credit to purchase 
more land. It is a cyclical financial equation that has driven Australia’s total 
farm debt to record highs ($86.9 billion) in the last financial year 
(Australian Government, 2020 ), effectively handing ownership of more 
farmland to banks.
Meanwhile, those without land are increasingly unable to break into 
farming. The size of farm that is considered viable has increased with the 
purportedly universal law of scalability, and so too has the cost of farmland 
per hectare. The result is that the “supply” of farmers may be running out, 
as those without millions in equity are unable to get established, while 
those within the sector continue to leave (Jasper, 2021 ), along with their 
families, community ties, rural services and place-based knowledge.
All of this is invisible at the industry or market level on which policy is 
focused. Because many Australian farmers produce common products that 
serve as the raw materials for others’ supply chains, their farms are consid -
ered broadly commensurable with any other. As such, any disruptions to 
their contribution, including their entire exit from the sector, barely regis -
ter, at least if the overall rate of productivity growth continues to climb, as 
it tends to do if the land is absorbed into larger operations. Relatedly, the 
Productivity Commission does not rank agriculture as an essential indus -
try. Not only are exported products rarely discussed in anything but coarse 
economic summations, such as the “record $50.1 billion of Australian 
agriculture produced in 2019–2020” (Rural Bank, 2020 ), but also they 
are part of a supply chain that we now know the federal government does 
not consider to be critical because the products do not directly serve 
Australian consumers (Productivity Commission, 2021 ). For the many 
highly geared family farms straining to enter privileged global circulations, 
the upshot is that while they are trumpeted as a national success story—
Australian farmers are the best in the world! (Hayman & Rickards, 
2013 )—in other ways, they are relegated to a mere footnote in the ongo -
ing colonization of the planet by supply chain capitalism.2 SUPPLY CHAINS AS DISRUPTION 
18
rupturIng
North of Victoria’s wheat belt, not far from the expanses of plastic- 
wrapped grapevines, the landscape is increasingly dominated by almond 
plantations. Many of them are owned by Hancock Natural Resource 
Group, owned in turn by Canada’s largest insurer, Manulife Investment 
Management Company, which invests retirement funds for various groups 
of North American workers (Fairbairn, 2020 ). Almonds are an increas -
ingly popular crop, especially given demand for lower-carbon milk alterna -
tives, which is proving to be a serious disruption for the dairy industry 
(Clay et al., 2020 ). Yet the life cycle analysis (LCA) calculations that rank 
almond milk as generating lower carbon across its global supply chain rela -
tive to equivalent units of dairy milk not only exclude the complexities 
that make such calculations dubious (Freidberg, 2013 ) but also overlook 
most non-carbon considerations. The health, social and ecological disben -
efits of thirsty almond plantations upon local ecosystems and communities 
are severe and highly visible to those who now live in their midst. Such 
problems are not the fault of almond trees per se but the profit motive 
they are being put towards. Growing almond trees takes more water even 
than growing cotton (Davies, 2019 ), but it makes a certain short-term 
sense when the market price is so high.
Smaller-scale farmers express awe, anger and despair in relation to 
investor-operated large almond plantations. One tells eerie stories of the 
mysterious deaths of countless native birds (“pests”), especially corellas, 
and the sudden death of a large grove of decades-old eucalypts, allegedly 
for simply housing the offending birds. The elderly farmer who shares 
these stories took up long-distance running a long time ago to deal with 
the day-to-day stress of farming. Running generated the energy required 
to solve problems. But, he observes, “you need to run 100 kilometres to 
deal with such horror”.
Prosperity and precarity coexist in supply chains, which “make and use 
difference and ruination—both in human communities and in the natural 
world” (Tsing, 2016 ). The almond “boom” in northern Victoria is not 
likely to last long. Climate change is accelerating, and as a result, rainfall in 
northern Victoria is becoming less abundant and less reliable (Victorian 
Government, 2019 ). Elaborate water infrastructures are being installed to 
try to squeeze some savings out of the existing system, reducing the 
amount that is “wasted” by seeping into the environment. “Rolling out” 
such irrigation modernization is a massive task and requires farmers to get  L. RICKARDS AND M. HINKSON
19
on board. As such, it is disruptive. But disruption by modernization is 
deeply normalized and invisibilized.
The late French social theorist Bernard Stiegler compels us to approach 
disruption as nothing short of an epoch-breaking, unprecedented global 
force. Automated and reticulated society—society in the time of global 
supply chains—is a “global cause of colossal social disintegration” (Stiegler, 
2019 , p. 6). Disruption from this perspective is not a condition of techno -
logical glitches or failures in a system but a system itself . It destroys local 
culture, and disintegrates and exploits psychosocial energies, as well as 
equipment, infrastructure and heritage. Disruption, Stiegler argues, ren -
ders human will obsolete—it always arrives too late. It destroys affective 
relations and the processes of intergenerational transmission and transla -
tion whereby shared expectations of and orientations towards the future 
are generated (Stiegler, 2019 , pp. 8–10). Such insights would resonate 
strongly with the growing number of Australian farmers without farms 
and rural families without neighbours or real communities. So too do they 
resonate in other places being reshaped by supply chain capitalism. Marc 
Edelman, for instance, describes the “hollowing out” of the rural United 
States as corporate-state abandonment has delivered “shredded social fab -
ric”. Justified by neoliberal capital logic, social supports are being compre -
hensively withdrawn, leaving a devastating human toll.
But the view from the ground also tempers Stiegler’s critical insights—
disruption is not so total nor so spectacular. As Tsing ( 2012a , p. 36) puts 
it, “grand schemes never fully colonise the territories upon which they are 
imposed”. In Australia, the colonization of rural landscapes and life by 
corporate power and its logics is incomplete, revealing the “unstable com -
mitments” that characterize supply chains (Tsing, 2009 ). The coloniza -
tion of rural landscapes and life by corporate power is layered upon older, 
ongoing processes of colonization and dispossession of First Nations peo -
ple. Indeed, supply chain capitalism exploits pre-existing forms of dispos -
session, taking advantage of the destruction of spiritual connection to land 
and water that may otherwise have provided more widespread moral 
anchorage, guidance and resistance. Yet this is not the end of the story. 
One response to the developments sketched here is a strong yearning 
across Australian agricultural communities to learn from and help nurture 
Aboriginal cultural attitudes and practice. A growing coalition of activist 
farmers, environmentalists, First Nations people and concerned citizens is 
promoting a new kind of collective commitment, to urgently prioritize the 
fundamental health of the Country, water and people. Such alliances offer 2 SUPPLY CHAINS AS DISRUPTION 
20
our best hope of imagining how we might hack and remodel supply chains, 
and in the process re-embed food production in the activities of feeding 
and nurturance, in communities and the Country.

Agri-investment Cashing in on COVID-19
Sarah Ruth Sippel
Abstract Global agri-food relationships are continuously changing. 
However, some periods can be perceived as critical moments when sudden 
events challenge established patterns and introduce new dynamics within the 
agri-food system. Many observers identified the food price hikes in 
2007/2008 as such a “turning point”. The food price hikes were seen as a 
stark reminder of the fragility and volatility of the global food system and 
interpreted as signalling a structural crisis in agriculture and its organizational 
and institutional frameworks. The 2008 crisis produced both winners and 
losers. Among the winners were institutional investors that started engaging 
much more actively in the area of productive resources. Roughly ten years 
later, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global agri-food relationships 
again, perhaps even more profoundly. This chapter juxtaposes the crises of 
2007/2008 and 2020/2021 and explores the role of financial actors within 
them. It analyses how financial investors, who emerged as powerful actors 
out of the 2008 crisis, responded to, and dealt with, the COVID-19 crisis. It 
further investigates how the pandemic has been rhetorically framed, what 
investment strategies were promoted, and how financial investors anticipate 
their engagement with agri-food in (post-)pandemic times.

IntroductIon
Global agri-food relationships are continuously changing. However, some 
periods are perceived as critical moments when sudden events challenge 
established patterns and introduce new dynamics within the agri-food sys -
tem. Many observers identified the food price hikes in 2007/2008 and 
2011 as a “turning point” in global agri-food relationships. A decade on, 
the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global agri-food relationships 
again, perhaps even more profoundly. In this chapter, I juxtapose the cri -
ses of 2007/2008 and 2020/2021 and look specifically at the role of 
financial actors within these. I will address the following questions: how 
have financial investors—who emerged as new and powerful agri-food 
actors out of the 2008 crisis—responded to, and dealt with, the COVID-19 
crisis? How has the pandemic been rhetorically framed, what kinds of 
investment strategies have been promoted, and how are financial investors 
anticipating their engagement with agri-food in (post-)pandemic times?
I begin by briefly outlining how and why financial investors emerged as 
new players in the agri-food system post-2008. I then outline the response 
of agri-food investors to the pandemic and suggest that three main argu -
ments can be identified: first, the pandemic is seen as having proven the 
case for ag-investments by revealing its resiliency in times of crisis; second, 
the pandemic is presented as a push for further investment in ag- and 
food-tech; and third, the pandemic is regarded as reinforcing the trend 
towards increased emphasis on sustainability and climate change within 
investments. I conclude that while the agri-food investment discourse has 
broadened to incorporate new areas and issues, its underlying logic of 
presenting crisis as an opportunity for profit-making remains unchanged.
This chapter is based on analysis of 160 articles on COVID-19 and 
agricultural investment published on the platform Agri Investor ( agriin -
vestor.com ) between March 2020 and July 2021. Agri Investor is a plat -
form providing information on agri-investment, including news on deals, 
companies, people, and market trends, as well as background analysis and 
commentary. Agri Investor is a key actor that has been supporting the 
discursive construction and promotion of agriculture as a financial asset 
class since 2010 and has also organized events to bring stakeholders 
together. S. R. SIPPEL

In 2008, after two decades of volatile but overall declining food prices, 
global prices for staple foods such as maize, wheat and rice increased sig -
nificantly within a few years (Mittal, 2009 ). The drivers of the price hikes 
included short- and mid-term factors such as the temporary decline of 
agricultural production and food stocks, coupled with rising demand, 
export restrictions and new agro-fuel policies, as well as financial specula -
tion on commodity markets. These factors were embedded within long-
term developments such as declining investments in rural areas and 
state-led re-regulation of agricultural and financial policies (Gertel & 
Sippel, 2016 ). Together, the events of 2007/2008 were seen as “a stark 
reminder of the fragility and volatility of the global food system” (Clapp 
& Cohen, 2009 , p. 1) and interpreted as signalling a structural crisis in 
agriculture and its organizational and institutional frameworks (McMichael 
& Schneider, 2011 ). Introducing their book Food Systems Failure , Rosin, 
Stock and Campbell suggest that the 2007/2008 crisis exposed the “chal -
lenge that localized food scarcity, and subsequent popular protest … posed 
to a shared sense of progress—and some would argue complacency—
toward meeting the world’s food demands” (Rosin et al., 2012 , p. 1). 
Hence, they conclude that “[c]learly, an ability to feed the global popula -
tion was proving to be less certain and hunger on a large scale was still a 
reality” (Rosin et al., 2012 , p. 1). As noted by many observers, the food 
price hikes impacted especially hard on those groups of people who already 
needed to spend a major part of their income on food—and resulted in 
“food riots” in numerous urban centres across the Global South 
(McMichael, 2014 , p. 948). At the same time, the increase in food com -
modity prices also led a number of new actors—who had not previously 
been present or very active in the agri-food system—to start engaging 
much more actively in the area of productive resources. Among these 
actors were state- and finance-backed actors, who were prompted to invest 
in natural resources—and first and foremost productive farmland—by a 
combination of food security motives and a search for alternative financial 
investment opportunities.
Since the early 2000s, and specifically following the financial crisis of 
2007/2008, numerous specialized agricultural investment vehicles have 
been established, taking various legal forms (including private equity 
funds, hedge funds, real estate management trusts, and private and public 3 AGRI-INVESTMENT CASHING IN ON COVID-19 
26
companies) and pursuing different farm ownership and management strat -
egies to construct income streams for investors (cf. Daniel, 2012 ; Fairbairn, 
2014 , 2020 ; Bjørkhaug et al., 2018 ). The interest in productive resources 
was partly a response to the poor performance of “traditional” asset classes 
(such as equities and bonds), all of which suffered during the financial 
crisis. Consequently, investors searched for new “alternative” asset classes 
providing returns uncorrelated with the “traditional” ones already existing 
in their portfolios. Agriculture and farmland were promoted as offering 
this low or negative correlation with traditional assets and positive risk- 
return characteristics, both of which were seen as adding to the overall 
performance of financial portfolios. Moreover, and contrary to other asset 
classes, in financial theory, both appreciation and the productive capacity 
of land (i.e., the value of its products) constitute the financial value of 
land. In other words, farmland is seen as both productive and appreciat -
ing—as “gold with yield” (Fairbairn, 2014 ). Further “investment funda -
mentals” for farmland investments were the finite availability of land, 
combined with the rising demand for food due to prospective population 
growth. “Food security” was a crucial narrative and appeared as both a 
motive to legitimize investment in agriculture and an incentive to stimu -
late capital inflows into agricultural investment funds (Larder et al., 2015 ).

to covId-19
Given that financial actors’ much more intimate engagement with agricul -
ture emerged out of the conjunction of the 2008 crises, how have these 
actors dealt with the COVID-19 crisis? I now turn to the response of 
financial investors to the pandemic as reported on the Agri Investor plat -
form. The initial reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 was 
marked by a certain degree of uncertainty. The global spread of the virus 
was unprecedented, and early articles report that investors’ reactions 
reflected the newness and unpredictability of this situation. One of the 
first articles dealing with COVID-19, titled “Coronavirus plays on the 
mind of agri investors worldwide”, reflects this feeling and describes inves -
tors as “nervous and cautious” (Kemp, 2020a ). The article starts by stat -
ing that “the impact of coronavirus played out across global financial 
markets in the past two weeks, with stock markets tumbling and compa -
nies … issuing warnings about the impact on earnings” (Kemp, 2020a ).  S. R. SIPPEL
27
The article continues that “agriculture is no exception” and reports that, 
although investors were not panicking, there was growing concern in the 
industry about how long the disruption would last. Australian agriculture 
specifically is seen as vulnerable, due to its dependence on exports, and 
with China—where the coronavirus originated—being Australia’s biggest 
export market for major commodities. The article also mentions concerns 
about congestion in supply chains in Southeast Asia, with the risk of prod -
uct being stuck at ports.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continued over the course of 2020, this 
initially rather cautious perspective evolved into a much more confident 
position about the performance of ag-investment. Investments in agricul -
ture are eventually not only presented as “crisis proofed” but are consid -
ered to have large potential for post-pandemic times. Three major themes 
can be identified, which are explored below.
covId-19 P roves  the case For ag-Investment
The first general theme that can be identified is that COVID-19 is seen as 
having made the case for ag-investment. As early as late June 2020, 
Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) CEO Elizabeth O’Leary 
explained that ag-investments were continuing to perform well in com -
parison to other asset classes: “As we moved through that early fact- finding 
stage, it became clear that, particularly for investments like ours with a 
long-term focus and modest levels of leverage, along with the strong pro -
duction environment in Australia and strong commodity prices, meant 
that their exposure with us did not warrant any attention beyond the usual 
levels” (Kemp, 2020b ). In a similar vein, in early July 2020, Angus Ingram, 
investments and partnerships manager at Kilter Rural, is quoted as saying, 
“In terms of financial performance—because we are primary production, 
farmland and water managers—we just haven’t been exposed to any eco -
nomic downturn at all [from the coronavirus]. In fact, probably quite the 
contrary” (Kemp, 2020d ). The article states that Kilter Rural’s invest -
ments, as well as most of the others reported to Agri Investor by ag-fund 
managers at that point, performed strongly during the COVID-19 crisis. 
This point is made in comparison to other sectors, which were previously 
considered “safe investments” and which suffered during the pandemic, 
from real estate investments in retail, hotel and office space to infrastruc -
ture investments in airports.3 AGRI-INVESTMENT CASHING IN ON COVID-19 
28
Thus, some months into the pandemic, COVID-19 is mostly portrayed 
as showing agriculture’s resilience as an asset class and proving the strength 
of agriculture’s investment fundamentals. This resilience is seen as 
grounded in agriculture being an “essential” sector, as well as its non- 
correlation to other economic sectors (Kemp, 2020b ). The crisis is thus 
seen as serving to “reaffirm ag as a resilient and uncorrelated asset class” 
(Ali, 2020b ) or, in the words of Growth Farms’ managing director David 
Sackett, “If anything will help prove the thesis that agricultural invest -
ments are non-correlated to other asset classes, this is it” (Ali, 2020c ). 
One article further compares the 2020 situation with 2009/2010, when 
there was a similar fundraising environment as agribusiness’s lack of cor -
relation to the broader economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis 
drove the increase in interest. “Investors very much like that the sectors 
that we focus on are essential and these businesses have continued in this 
period [COVID-19]” (Janiec, 2020b ). This performance showed that 
“the underlying investments are uncorrelated to a lot of other asset classes 
that the investors have exposure to” (Janiec, 2020b ). Similar to 
2007/2008, food (in)security is presented as another strong fundamental 
and incentive for ag-investment. For example, we can read that “food 
security anxieties will be a catalyst for investment”, as the pandemic has 
“heightened the scrutiny with which virtually every nation views its global 
and domestic food supply chains” (Ali, 2020b ).
At the end of 2020, several articles review the year and again the major 
conclusion is that agriculture has proven itself as “crisis resilient”. It is 
stated that “agriculture as an asset class navigated through 2020 relatively 
unscathed from the covid-19 crisis” (Corbett, 2020 ), while another article 
concludes, “the world needs food and fiber just as much during a pan -
demic as at any other time” (Kemp, 2020c ). This is seen as “a salient les -
son for investors that farmland and other food-related assets can be useful, 
even necessary, parts of a diversified portfolio, helping to pick up the slack 
when other asset types suffer” (Kemp, 2020c ). Ag’s resiliency and “funda -
mental growth drivers” are considered as proven, unless “unnaturally dis -
torted as in the case of trade wars” (Ali, 2020c ). In essence, this article 
concludes, “trade wars are bigger threats than pandemics”, referring to 
both the US–China trade war and Australia’s trade disputes with its largest 
trading partner, China. S. R. SIPPEL

covId-19 as a Push For ag- 
and Food-tech Investment
The second key theme is that COVID-19 has exposed the crucial impor -
tance and future relevance of digital technologies, which make investment 
in ag- and food-tech sectors both necessary and lucrative. Three areas are 
emphasized in particular: the pandemic’s push for indoor farming and for 
labour mechanization, and its impact on food supply chains and consump -
tion more generally.
Regarding the first, indoor ag-tech is presented as having a “sizable 
runway as many in and outside the industry look toward it as a potential 
future solution to food scarcity and food supply chain issues” (Szkutak, 
2020 ). Another article in early 2021 explains that indoor farming became 
the subject of much discussion and investment throughout 2020 as the 
global food supply chain challenges created by the pandemic led to food 
security fears: “Indoor farming, both through naturally lit greenhouses 
and vertical farming operations using LED lighting and sophisticated AI 
systems, were therefore identified by many as a potential solution for prop -
ping up domestic food production” (Ali, 2021 ). It is further reported that 
COVID-19 even led state-owned investors to divert their attention away 
from real assets towards ag-tech, as the threat of a food security crisis made 
food and ag-focused technology a “small but important” part of invest -
ments. Here, an insider from the sovereign wealth fund industry is quoted 
as saying, “Sophisticated sovereign wealth funds are not looking too much 
into land anymore. What they are looking into is to add value into the 
irrigation and processing value chain. That’s why we call agtech an evolu -
tion of the general industry. We think it’s what investors are tending to 
these days” (Janiec, 2021 ).
Issues surrounding labour exposed during the pandemic are the second 
major incentive for investment in agricultural technologies, and notably 
those helping to reduce labour on farms through automation. As one arti -
cle states, COVID-19 exposed shortcomings such as the reliance on 
migrant labour and poor working conditions in food-processing facilities. 
These, the article suggests, will “largely be solved by increased mechaniza -
tion and automation”. “This crisis will push all producers, including inves -
tor-led producers … towards automation and mechanization to a greater 
degree than they would have prior to the crisis” (Ali, 2020a ). It is further 
reported that farm robotics and mechanization only accounted for 
US$179 million (1 per cent) of the total US$19.8 billion invested in 3 AGRI-INVESTMENT CASHING IN ON COVID-19 
30
ag- tech companies in 2019 (based on Agfunder data). Hence, investment 
in mechanization and automation had to be “ratcheted up significantly if 
it is truly set to solve the workforce issues exposed by the pandemic” (Ali, 
2020a ). The pandemic is thus presented as an important moment to be 
making this investment, supported by voices from within the industry: 
“Recession and covid is this perfect storm for advancing the field of robot -
ics, from a customer interest standpoint, a decade forward” (Janiec, 2020c ).
Lastly, food-tech investments are promoted as an important future 
growth sector. This growth is seen as driven not only by increasing con -
sumer demand for alternatives to meat and dairy but also by major changes 
in how people are purchasing their food, where food is prepared, and how 
food is delivered to the consumer, as the entire food industry is going 
through a transformation. Here, an insider is quoted as saying, “Covid has 
accelerated changes to foodtech and to the supply chain. It has even 
affected how consumers eat, from curbside dining to takeout” 
(Goldfisher, 2020 ).
covId-19 as a Push For sustaInabIlIty
A third theme is a stronger emphasis on sustainability, with the pandemic 
being presented as a “test” for future challenges in light of climate change. 
In this vein, a representative of McKinsey is quoted as saying, “Obviously, 
carbon management is not a global pandemic. They are quite different, 
but some of the ways companies have to respond have consistency to 
them … If you believe post-covid we’re all going to have some view of 
what needs to be done from a resilience standpoint, some of the chal -
lenges that climate change can raise tests our resilience in different forms” 
(Janiec, 2020a ). Over the course of 2020, sustainability becomes an 
increasingly important theme in articles on the impact of, and lessons 
from, the pandemic. In an article titled “Sustainability now matters in 
PE”, it is reported that British Private Equity and Venture Capital 
Association (BVCA) director general Michael Moore called the pandemic 
a reminder that the industry is both “an economic force and a social one”. 
The article further states that the private equity ecosystem had come a 
long way in the past decade in terms of “accepting and integrating envi -
ronmental, social and governance considerations into its investment pro -
cesses”. This was reflected in the inclusion of non-financial key performance 
indicators, such as carbon emissions (Mitchenall, 2020 ). Also, MIRA 
CEO O’Leary is portrayed as reflecting on the role that capital investment  S. R. SIPPEL
31
in agriculture could play “in making both societies and landscapes more 
resilient” (Kemp, 2020b ). According to O’Leary, there is “strong proof” 
that sustainable farming addressing climate change is mutually beneficial 
to the environment and to the “farmer’s bottom line”. The way this is to 
be achieved is by increasing farmers’ participation in sophisticated envi -
ronmental markets, to “aid the decarbonization story” as well as more 
progressive farming practices adopted in an economically rational way 
(Kemp, 2020b ).
Agriculture is, lastly, identified as playing a key role as the world moves 
towards greater resilience following COVID-19, notably in reducing 
emissions. Referring to a McKinsey representative, one article reports that 
agricultural companies were developing business models designed to ben -
efit from potential future regulations on carbon emissions. The lack of 
large-scale carbon markets is seen as “limiting commitment among inves -
tors to finance emissions-reductions that do not present a clear return on 
investment” (Janiec, 2020a ).
cashIng  In on covId-19?
COVID-19 has once again revealed the multiple flaws in our food system. 
That system is largely built on long-distance food supply chains, many of 
which have been disrupted due to lockdowns and trade restrictions. As 
food is treated not as a common good but as a commodity, people’s food 
security depends on their purchasing power, which in many cases declined 
due to the pandemic-induced global recession. These vulnerabilities in the 
global food system, as Clapp and Moseley conclude, are neither new nor 
accidental. Rather, they are grounded in the policy responses to past food 
crises over 70 years that “have helped forge a global food system that is 
increasingly specialized, dependent on trade, and premised on the need to 
produce more food with industrial methods—all in the name of improving 
efficiency” (Clapp & Moseley, 2020 , p. 1408). Yet, for some actors, crises 
also provide the opportunity for profit-making—a mechanism that Naomi 
Klein has famously termed “disaster capitalism”, namely the implementa -
tion of calculated, free-market “solutions” to crises that exploit and exac -
erbate existing inequalities (Solis, 2020 ). Thus, as Reisman ( 2021 , p. 911) 
observes, disaster moments such as the current pandemic require height -
ened caution about business activities “which momentarily suit crisis relief 
narratives but may ultimately serve other interests”.3 AGRI-INVESTMENT CASHING IN ON COVID-19 
32
This chapter has investigated the responses of agri-food investors to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating that agri-food investors used the 
most recent crisis to further strengthen the case for agri-investment, 
which—as the argument goes—has now proven itself not only lucrative 
but also a crisis-proof investment. While the 2007/2008 conjunction of 
events represented the “initial” crisis moment that incentivized investors 
to search for alternative investment possibilities, the pandemic has been 
presented as consolidating agriculture as an alternative investment class. 
The pandemic underlined the core fundamentals of the asset class—agri- 
food is not an outlier asset class any more but now qualifies as an “essen -
tial” sector. Can agri-food investment help to stabilize a pandemic- and 
increasingly crisis-ridden future food system, supporting its essential func -
tion for human survival? Or are agri-food investors’ responses rather a 
form of “disaster capitalism”?
By way of conclusion, I make three observations. The first concerns the 
issue of “food security”. The challenge to “feed the world” has been a 
consistent thread running through investor discourses associated with 
both crises and is used to morally legitimize and financially incentivize 
agri-food investment. Throughout both crises, however, the rhetoric fol -
lowed a rather simplistic neo-Malthusian argument that “people need to 
eat” in moments of financial, economic or environmental crisis as much as 
they do during a pandemic. This narrative continuously disregards the 
complexity of food security and the well-established insight that food 
security is not only a matter of food being produced. As Sen ( 1981 ) 
famously formulated in his entitlement approach to food security, “it is 
fundamentally about who gets access  to available food, which is about the 
distribution of wealth and resources” (Devereux et  al., 2020 , p.  771; 
emphasis added). The pandemic has not only affected food production 
and supply chains but also significantly lowered people’s ability to access 
sufficient and nutritious food due to the consequences of lockdowns and 
economic recession, especially for vulnerable groups (Clapp & Moseley, 
2020 ). Thus, financial investments that focus on food production and 
supply chains might allow investors to generate returns from an “essential 
sector”—but they do not help alleviate the food insecurity of those who 
cannot access food.
Second, the pandemic has been used to make the case for further invest -
ments in agriculture and food that go beyond those promoted in 
2007/2008, most prominently investments in the recently much-hyped 
areas of ag- and food-tech. As Fairbairn and Guthman ( 2020 , p.  587)  S. R. SIPPEL
33
note, Silicon Valley’s ag- and food-tech scene was quick in identifying 
COVID-19 as an opportunity and presented the pandemic as amplifying 
the need for its existence (see also Reisman, 2021 ). As ag-investment in 
farming has become increasingly established, new digital ag- and food 
technologies are presented as a “fix” for social issues—such as exploitative 
labour conditions on farms and in processing factories—as well as under -
capitalized and therefore newly emerging lucrative investment opportuni -
ties. Again, however, underlying issues of social inequalities and 
vulnerabilities of often migrant farm and food-processing workers are not 
tackled within this approach but rather blatantly disregarded. Rather than 
suggesting that farm and factory workers’ labour conditions need to 
change, the human factor is identified as the “problem” to discard.
Last, the pandemic has put sustainability and climate change much 
more prominently on the agenda, both of which were not part of the agri- 
food investor discourse in 2007/2008. As with the investment narratives 
outlined above, these issues are being addressed within a market and 
investment rationale, which suggests that more environmentally friendly 
and sustainable practices need to deliver returns to make them worthwhile 
considerations for investors. This argument is reminiscent of the ecologi -
cal fix, which, as Bakker ( 2009 , p.  1782, drawing on Vandana Shiva’s 
description of “sustainable development”) writes, is a means of “turning a 
potential threat into an opportunity”. And even more so, within this dis -
course, we find the “threat” to not commit to, and implement, more sus -
tainable practices if they are not presented as clear investment opportunities. 
While climate change and environmental issues are now at least recog -
nized as important challenges facing the world, the agri-food investor dis -
course suggests that they are not tackled out of insight or necessity but 
only if the financial returns are worthwhile. In sum, while the agri-food 
investment discourse has moved on to new areas and issues due to the 
pandemic, its underlying logic has remained stable—amid calls for “more 
of the same” approaches to solve those crises it has helped to produce.

Putting the Crisis to Work
Victoria Stead and Kirstie Petrou
Abstract As international borders closed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Australian horticultural industry experienced a dramatic reduction of 
key groups of workers upon which it has come to depend, particularly at 
harvest. These labour shortages focused public attention on the impor -
tance of seasonal labour for horticultural production and the availability of 
fresh fruit and produce, resulting in a paradoxical revaluation of that work. 
On the one hand, seasonal farm work was revalued as essential labour, and 
migrant workers were acknowledged as critical to Australia’s food security. 
On the other hand, the increased visibility of seasonal farm work high -
lighted its systematic devaluing as so-called unskilled work that is done for 
low wages, under often poor conditions, and that is widely figured through 
racialized narratives. Faced with the prospect of critical labour shortages, 
both industry and government sought—and largely failed—to reinscribe 
the terms by which seasonal labour was imagined in attempts to make it 
attractive to “local” workers. What resulted was an entrenching of uneven 
distributions of precarity, risk and vulnerability along the fault lines of race 
and migration status.

IntroductIon
Over recent decades, the Australian horticultural industry has come to 
depend, as have many global horticultural industries, on labour performed 
by highly mobile, seasonal workforces. Notwithstanding periodic media 
exposés of poor working conditions, the mobility and labour of this essen -
tial workforce—predominantly made up of non-white temporary migrants 
and concentrated in rural locations—have gone largely unremarked upon, 
and remained invisible to, the Australian citizenry. In March 2020, how -
ever, as borders snapped shut following the COVID-19 outbreak, horti -
cultural labour issues were thrust into the public and political spotlight. 
International border closures saw Australia’s overall horticultural work -
force plummet as many temporary migrant workers—including those on 
Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visas, international students and Pacific 
Islanders employed through the Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) 
guest worker scheme—returned home and replacements were unable to 
arrive. The heightened visibility of seasonal labour issues resulting from 
these shortages produced a paradoxical revaluing of this work. On the one 
hand, there was a renewed valuing of seasonal farm work as “essential” 
labour and of migrant workers as critical to Australia’s food security—an 
awareness heightened by consumer experiences of empty shelves and stock 
shortages at the supermarket end of supply chains. Yet, the increased visi -
bility of seasonal farm work also highlighted its systematic devaluing as 
“un-skilled” work that is done for low wages, often under poor condi -
tions, and that, critically, is widely deemed unsuitable and unwanted by 
“local” workers. Attempts by industry and government to reinscribe the 
terms in which seasonal labour was imagined to make it attractive to local 
workers overwhelmingly failed. Nor did the recognition of seasonal labour 
as “essential” ultimately translate into increased economic valuation 
through significantly improved wages or conditions. Rather, what was 
demonstrated throughout the pandemic was the reassertion of structures 
and systems that unevenly distribute precarity, risk and vulnerability along 
the fault lines of race and migration status.
The shifting valuations of horticultural labour amid the pandemic high -
light ambiguities inherent to value itself. In one sense, the simultaneous  V. STEAD AND K. PETROU
41
valuing and devaluing of seasonal labour is reflective of a tension running 
through all relations of capitalist production, as Marx theorized in his 
labour theory of value. That is, labour creates value (in the things it pro -
duces) in excess of the valuation of that labour through wages. In this 
sense, labour’s valuation through wages never  matches the value produced 
by labour, and it is this gap that produces profit for those controlling the 
means of production. In another sense, seasonal labour’s simultaneous 
valuing and devaluing reflects an underlying ambiguity within which, as 
Graeber ( 2001 ) observes, value denotes at once the price of things (its 
economic sense), the extent to which a thing is considered desirable or 
good (its sociological sense) and the meaningful difference attributed to 
signifiers (its linguistic sense). The economic and sociological dimensions 
of value, particularly, converge in the figuring of horticultural labour 
through the pandemic, including through narratives that position it as 
work good for, and suited to, the bodies of migrants and others outside of 
the “citizenship-labour nexus” (Neilson & Rossiter, 2008 , p. 59), even as 
political effort has also been put towards reactivating that nexus through 
appeals for local labour. These multiple dimensions of labour value reflect 
what others (e.g. Peck, 1996 ) have shown, namely that labour power is 
produced and reproduced through social as well as economic processes 
that extend beyond the workplace. These include migration regimes and 
strictures, which do not simply increase the total pool of available labour 
for industry but more specifically increase the availability of labour that is 
more exploitable and more suitable for subordination (Scott, 2013 ). They 
include racialized imaginaries and hierarchies that are themselves rooted in 
the histories and geographies of Empire (Stead, 2019 , 2021 ).
Critical theorists of supply chains have highlighted the role of racial -
ized, gendered, geographic and other forms of difference in their opera -
tion and in capitalist value creation (Bear et al., 2015 ; Tsing, 2009 , 2016 ). 
In Anna Tsing’s theorization of “supply chain capitalism”, these form the 
basis of the kinds of “niche difference” ( 2009 , p. 167) around which the 
different stages of geographically dispersed supply chains are organized. 
Diversity, for Tsing, is thus inherently bound up with outsourcing  as a key 
technique of supply-chain capitalism, not as a peripheral consideration but 
as an integral part of its structure. Yet while Tsing’s attention to the role 
of racialized relations in the organization of contemporary capitalist pro -
duction resonates with the analysis we develop here, the kinds of horticul -
tural production we are concerned with also differ in significant ways from 
models of global supply chains organized through outsourcing. Rather, 4 PUTTING THE CRISIS TO WORK 
42
the industry’s use of temporary migrant labour provides what geographer 
Sam Scott ( 2013 ), writing about the UK fruit industry, has described, fol -
lowing Harvey, as an “ in situ  spatial fix”. In the Australian context, this 
enables the reproduction of imaginatively charged narratives of national 
self-sufficiency that belie the kinds of dependencies, vulnerabilities and 
racialized inequalities laid bare by the pandemic.
In this chapter, we consider, first, the ways in which border logics and 
narratives of national self-sufficiency were mobilized in the early days of 
the pandemic. We then consider the widespread labour shortages and the 
awareness these generated about the industry’s reliance on migration. We 
document both the various attempts to mobilize “local workers” and the 
narratives that framed these efforts and their failures. The gap between the 
narrative of self-sufficiency and the reliance on migrant workers is reflec -
tive, we argue, of ambiguities in how the scope and place of supply chains 
are conceptualized. The competing, sometimes contradictory imaginings 
of both local and migrant workers, meanwhile, speak to the shifting ways 
in which value is imagined, produced and assessed within these chains. In 
the final section, we focus on the operation of race, migration and visa 
status in the production of horticultural labour power and value.
Border  LogIcs  and narratIves  of natIonaL  
seLf-suffIcIency
Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted border closures 
and an amplification of border logics. On 19 March, eight days after the 
World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, Australian Prime 
Minister Scott Morrison announced international travel bans. With lim -
ited exemptions, only Australian citizens, permanent residents and their 
immediate family members were allowed to enter the country. At the same 
time, non-citizens within the country who were deemed not to be eco -
nomically valuable were encouraged to leave. Speaking on 3 April, 
Morrison declared that people in Australia holding temporary visas and 
without the capacity to support themselves financially—including the tens 
of thousands whose casual jobs had been abruptly terminated due to the 
effects of lockdowns—should “return to their home countries” (Gibson & 
Moran, 2020 ). Australia, Morrison continued, needed to focus on its citi -
zens and residents: “As much as it’s lovely to have visitors to Australia in 
good times, at times like this, if you are a visitor in this country, it is 
time … to make your way home.” The exception was those migrants, like  V. STEAD AND K. PETROU
43
“nurses or doctors”, whose “critical skills” could assist in Australia’s 
response to the crisis.
In this early, concentrated period of crisis response we see something of 
a reassertion of the “citizen-worker” as a political subject, a subjectivity 
previously theorized as in decline in the context of a globalizing economy 
and a polity marked by the prevalence of, and reliance on, migrant labour 
(Neilson & Rossiter, 2008 ). Here rights, protections, home and work 
itself are the domains of citizens. The exemption for “nurses or doctors” 
denotes both the exception amplifying the rule and assumptions of value 
tied to understandings of skill. These are themselves resonant with a 
longer- established Australian migration imaginary that has historically 
devalued “unskilled” and temporary migration, which have nevertheless 
become more prominent over recent decades, and on which many indus -
tries (like horticulture) now depend.
Alongside the closing of borders and calls for migrants to “go home”, 
these early weeks of the pandemic also saw widespread panic-buying 
prompted by a series of city- and state-wide lockdowns. Resulting shortages 
of many staple items were further exacerbated by disruptions to logistics 
systems, with the unfamiliar spectre of empty supermarket shelves bringing 
the vulnerabilities of just-in-time food supply chains into public conscious -
ness. The federal government responded to public concerns over struggling 
supply chains with forceful assertions of Australia’s self- sufficiency in food 
production. Agriculture Minister David Littleproud slammed “ridiculous” 
panic-buying, writing, “It is important to understand that Australian farm -
ers produce enough food for 75 million people: three times what we need.” 
Farmers, he continued, are “calmly going about the business of food pro -
duction” (Littleproud, 2020 ). By April, the government had produced a 
report emphasizing that empty shelves were merely a temporary “disrup -
tion” rather than an indication of food shortages. The report stressed that 
imports account for only 11 per cent of foods consumed in Australia and are 
“motivated by taste and variety” rather than a need to supplement local sup -
plies (ABARES, 2020 , p.  2). Despite the empty shelves, Australia’s self-
sufficiency was claimed to be assured.
“I c an’t get Workers ”
Farmers were, however, far from “calm”. The reliance of the horticultural 
industry on migrant labour is something that growers are keenly aware of, 
in ways that often run counter to the narratives of the predominantly 
urban-based political elite. Around 65,000 workers (out of a total industry 4 PUTTING THE CRISIS TO WORK 
44
workforce of 80,000) are employed annually to provide seasonal labour, 
including harvesting, picking, packing, planting and pruning (Australian 
Fresh Produce Alliance, n.d.). This work is almost invariably casual and 
paid by piece rates. Prior to the pandemic, only 5000 of these 65,000 
workers were reported to be Australian citizens or permanent residents 
(although these figures, sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 
do not include the locally resident undocumented workers upon whose 
labour the industry is heavily reliant). Around 8000 were Pacific Islander 
temporary labour migrants employed through the SWP; 52,000 were 
other temporary migrants, mostly on WHM visas, including many 
European backpackers undertaking eighty-eight days of agricultural work 
in order to secure a second-year visa extension under the provisions of the 
WHM scheme. As migrant arrivals all but ceased, it quickly became clear 
that Australian growers would struggle to meet their peak seasonal labour 
requirements. In September 2020, Ernst & Young ( 2020 ) forecast a 
shortfall of 26,000 workers for the coming harvest.
Several months into the pandemic, stories about farming labour short -
ages, and their effects, were proliferating in the mainstream media. These 
stories tended to invoke motifs, well established within Australian rural 
imaginaries, of family farms and struggling “Aussie battlers”. Vegetable 
growers in the Lindenow Valley were reported to have destroyed a celery 
crop worth $150,000 due to a lack of workers to pick it (Somerville et al., 
2021 ). Salad grower Dino Boratto was described as having been forced to 
destroy $20,000 worth of spinach when he could not make up for the lost 
labour of fifteen “skilled” SWP workers. Boratto was quoted as describing 
how the major supermarkets had predicted a rise in demand for salad 
leaves over the Christmas season, a demand he could not meet without 
(migrant) labour: “I looked them in the face and said, ‘Yeah? What do you 
want me to do? I can’t get workers’” (Topsfield, 2020 ).
LocatIng  ProductIon
The divergences between government narratives of self-sufficiency, and 
industry highlighting its reliance on migrant workers, speak to ambiguity 
in how—and where —horticultural production is conceptualized. Supply- 
chain thinking invokes a fundamental linearity, with bracketed, end-to- 
end sequences of production stages across which value production is 
understood to be distributed (Lepawsky & Billah, 2011 , p. 135). Where 
these chains extend across transnational space, this is understood to be the  V. STEAD AND K. PETROU
45
result of outsourcing (Tsing, 2009 , 2016 ). In important respects, how -
ever, the landedness of farming proves resistant to geographical dispersion 
in horticultural production. The immobile materialities of trees and roots 
cannot be outsourced, even if supermarkets and buyers at the powerful 
consumer ends of food supply chains readily cast a global net in selecting 
from whom they buy. It is this sense of place-bound production—and the 
nationalistic and settler-colonial imaginaries bound up with it—that 
underpins the narratives of Australian self-sufficiency, as against govern -
ment appeals for endless growth in agricultural export markets.
Labour shortages catalysed by the pandemic reveal the fault lines in this 
figuring. Horticultural supply chains, so imagined, might indeed fall 
within a national frame, but the industry’s reliance on temporary migrant 
labour speaks to transnational aspects of production that fall outside the 
parameters of supply-chain modelling. In his analysis of the UK food 
industry, geographer Sam Scott ( 2013 ) draws on David Harvey’s concept 
of the “spatial fix” to describe this use of migrant labour as an in situ  spa-
tial fix for capital, in contrast to the kinds of geographic expansion that 
Harvey’s term is more often deployed to describe (cf. Anderson & 
Shuttleworth, 2004 ). Here, rather than stages of production being out -
sourced, what is shipped offshore is the work of producing the labour 
power that is then put to work in the fields and orchards into which work -
ers are imported.
These slippages in geographic framing invite us to think not only about 
where supply chains begin and end—and the forces of production that 
exceed them—but also about the kinds of value through which supply 
chains themselves are produced. Doing so brings back to the fore the mul -
tiple and ambiguous ways in which value itself is conceived—the tensions 
between value as economic price and value as that which is deemed socially 
good (for particular groups of people). These paradoxes of value became 
acutely visible as both industry and government sought to mobilize local 
labour to fill the shortages created by the pandemic border closures.
revaLuIng  LocaL LaBour ?
As the scale and implications of seasonal labour shortages became clear, 
government and industry looked to entice local workers into horticulture. 
Some spruiked lucrative returns from the piece rates that have long been a 
point of contention between industry, government and unions. Agriculture 
Minister David Littleproud, for example, declared that workers in 4 PUTTING THE CRISIS TO WORK 
46
Queensland were earning up to $3800 a week picking strawberries (labour 
that is widely documented, globally, as back-breakingly difficult and noto -
riously underpaid; see for example Holmes ( 2013 ) and Wells ( 1996 )). 
Other proposed financial incentives included allowing workers to continue 
to receive JobSeeker (social security) payments while undertaking horti -
cultural employment and one-off relocation payments to entice workers to 
rural locations facing labour shortages. The Northern Territory Farmers 
Association (NTFA), among others, suggested encouraging students to 
work in horticulture, promoting it as an alternative “gap year” option. 
Incentives such as reductions in tertiary student debt were considered, 
and NTFA chief executive Paul Burke suggested that a year working in 
rural and regional Australia could provide students with a valuable cultural 
exchange (Brann, 2020 ). Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack 
tried to lure young workers with promises of love and “Instagrammable” 
moments:
If you know somebody who might be on the coast who might be lounging 
around with a surfboard, tell them to come to the regions … Tell them to 
bring their mobile with them, because it would be a great Instagram moment 
for them … who knows … they might meet the love of their life. 
(Gillespie, 2020 )
Di West, a strawberry grower from Queensland, issued a call to arms, 
asking Australians to “pick for their country”. “You’re just here for a brief 
time,” she implored. “We need you to get out there and have a go and be 
a real Australian” (Nichols, 2020 ).
Even as unemployment rates rocketed upwards, these promises of love, 
money, national pride and Insta-fame fell flat. By 31 March 2021, only 
871 people had received relocation assistance for working in horticulture 
(McGlone, 2021 ), while media reporting highlighted the material and 
economic realities of seasonal labour. A report on the New South Wales 
blueberry industry, based on data collected during the 2019/2020 season 
and released as industry and government representatives were heralding 
lucrative returns from piece rates, confirmed the prevalence of wage theft 
and exploitative conditions, with rates of pay documented as low as $3 per 
hour (Cavanough & Wherrett, 2020 ). Other reportage highlighted the 
experiences of the relative few who did respond to the “call to arms”. 
Some accounts were broadly positive, if lacklustre in their enthusiasm. 
Eighteen-year-old Xavier Jackson, who was unemployed before working  V. STEAD AND K. PETROU
47
on a strawberry farm, said of the work, “It was a little tiring the first few 
days but I’m getting into it now and it’s not as bad as I thought it’d be” 
(Nichols, 2020 ). Other reports were significantly more dire. One worker, 
who was paid for six ten-hour working days, described things ending 
“sourly” when he saw he had earned far less than expected. Another 
worker on the same farm, who had been enticed by the promise of “adven -
ture”, described feeling “a little bit taken advantage of” when he discov -
ered that the piece rate he was paid did not even cover his accommodation 
costs (Uibu, 2021 ).
Union responses to both the call for local labour and the persistent 
labour shortages mirrored these critiques. There would be a “willing 
workforce already out there”, suggested the Australian Workers Union, if 
farmers simply “started paying people decent wages” (Sullivan, 2020 ). In 
this gap between promise and reality, though, lies more than the question 
of decent wages. Encapsulated within both the calls to work and the ulti -
mate failure to meet shortages with local labour are forms of valuation that 
extend far beyond issues of price, encompassing questions of goodness, 
desirability and suitability. It is to these questions of value, and the geog -
raphies and often racialized imaginaries that underpin them, that we turn 
in the final section.
good Work, good Workers ?
If, as the union movement has emphasized, job insecurity and low rates of 
pay have proved disincentives for local workers to take up rural horticul -
tural labour throughout the pandemic, the fact that this work was never -
theless readily filled with migrant workers prior to COVID-19—and the 
implications of this—should not be treated as self-evident. In his theoriz -
ing of the in situ  spatial fix in the UK fruit industry, Scott ( 2013 ) suggests 
that the fix works for capital in two ways. First, it generates workers with 
forms of “human capital” desirable for industry, particularly migrant 
workers who are skilled and motivated (including because of economic 
necessity and the precariousness of their lives and visa statuses) to work in 
ways the industry finds productive. Second, it works to divide and disci -
pline workers and limit opportunities for collective action, including in a 
context of neoliberal restructuring. Contingent visa statuses, North–South 
structural inequalities, and the absence of alternative welfare entitlements 
compel migrant labour power in ways that are less effective for 4 PUTTING THE CRISIS TO WORK 
48
citizen- workers. The distribution of “good” and “bad” workers, Scott 
observes, has a distinct geography.
In late 2020, a political decision was made to restart the intake of SWP 
workers under controlled conditions. Farmers’ responses to this decision 
reflect these valuations of “good” migrant labour. Speaking to the media, 
mango farmer Barry Albrecht explained: “It costs us to bring them [SWP 
workers] in, with quarantine fees and all that. But we feel they’re worth 
it … They’re so easy to get along with: polite, well-mannered, clean” 
(Srinivasan, 2020 ). The flipside of these valuations was the admonishment 
of local workers by growers as lazy and work-shy. Thus, media coverage of 
pandemic labour shortages included accounts of willing Australians denied 
work by growers. One applicant, Lukus, reported:
I’ve been told from a couple they’re worried that, as an Australian, I’m 
going to be lazy … I’m not as exploitable as a foreigner … Now they’re 
talking about fast-tracking Pacific Islander workers and that’s fine, and all 
power to them, but if they won’t even consider an Australian employee 
who’s willing to work, then it leaves some questions. (Kelly, 2020 )
The kinds of difference being mobilized here are not exclusively orga -
nized around visa and citizenship status. Throughout the industry, the 
descriptors “Australian” and “local” are widely used to denote white 
workers, as distinct from locally resident but non-white workers, such as 
settled Pacific Islander populations, asylum seekers or refugees, who are 
nonetheless excluded from the kinds of belonging that the descriptor 
“local” bestows, even if they are nominally considered harder-working or 
more desirable workers (Stead, 2019 ; Stead et al., 2022 ). These are, then, 
strongly racialized figurings of “insider” and “outsider”. The exceptions 
are European backpackers, who form a large proportion of WHMs. It is 
notable, though, that the horticultural labour of these white workers is 
figured as temporary, just as it is imagined it might be for young “Aussies” 
who might take a pandemic fruit-picking “gap year”—an adventure good 
for an Instagram moment, but not the norm within the context of their 
lives and the social and cultural conditions of their making.
The valuations—in the broader sociological sense—of horticultural 
workers are thus deeply ambiguous. Local (white, often urban) workers 
are both the subject of nationalistic calls to arms and to adventure and 
admonished for their failure to live up to the imagined (rural) work ethic 
invoked by that nationalism. Migrant (often non-white) workers are  V. STEAD AND K. PETROU
49
valorized as good workers and the industry’s “saviours”, well-suited to 
work for which they nevertheless continue to receive poor pay and 
conditions.
Indeed, while proposals for enticing locals into the horticultural work -
force involved financial incentives, the increased visibility and valuation of 
seasonal work as essential labour has not resulted in improved pay or con -
ditions for the migrant and non-white resident workers who have remained 
the industry’s mainstay. The experiences of those SWP workers who were 
already present in the country when the international borders were closed 
and who remained in Australia to continue working reflect this. The pan -
demic has intensified and extended existing issues in the SWP scheme, 
including isolation, restricted movement and inadequate pay (Petrou 
et al., 2021 ). Migrant workers have endured the stress of extended separa -
tion from their families, and some SWP employers have not allowed work -
ers to return home when they wanted to. Increasingly, SWP workers have 
absconded from their places of employment due to insufficient work, 
meaning they will never be able to participate in the scheme again. Similarly 
entrenched conditions, and heightened vulnerabilities through the pan -
demic, have been documented globally (e.g. Haley et  al., 2020 ; 
Neef, 2020 ).
concLusIon
If crisis is an idiom that works to stabilize existing structures, and to con -
ceal the contradictions entrenched in twenty-first-century capitalism 
(Masco, 2017 ; Roitman, 2014 ), how was that idiom put to work in the 
context of horticultural labour relations during the pandemic? The crises 
projected through government, industry and public discourses included 
the material experiences of labour shortages and panic buying, but also the 
affective intensities of a white work ethic understood to be in decline and 
a mode of landedness (the family farm) experienced as under threat. In 
none of this, though, was attention focused on the conditions of possibil -
ity underpinning those experiences of crisis. By these, we do not mean the 
pandemic itself but rather the deeper-seated fault lines that the pandemic 
exposed—the inequalities and geographies of racialized capitalism, the 
colonial dispossessions out of which the Australian family farm is forged, 
the exclusions of border regimes, or the alienation of most people from 
the activity of food production and the role of powerful corporate agents 
in setting the terms of that alienation.4 PUTTING THE CRISIS TO WORK 
50
Rather, the pandemic labour shortages and empty supermarket shelves 
were recast as technical crises—that is, supply-chain problems—bracketed 
just as supply chains themselves are bracketed. In this vein, the pandemic’s 
disruptions produced a renewed appreciation of seasonal labour as “essen -
tial” work, but left unchanged the economic terms and conditions of its 
valuation. Attempts to shift the industry’s reliance on migrant workers 
through enticing a local workforce were, ultimately, cast as temporary 
measures—short-term and extraordinary responses to labour shortages 
imagined as temporary interruptions to production systems otherwise fig -
ured by capital as smooth, efficient, just-in-time and not in need of 
transformation.

these regimes of production look much like their neighbours’, as they use 
the same logistical chains, infrastructure and financial systems as other 
wheatbelt producers. On the other, their farming practice—informed by a 
probiotic and more-than- human epistemology the Haggertys call “natural

IntroductIon
The wheatbelt of Western Australia (WA) marks a disruptive force on an 
ancient landscape, an upheaval wrought by social and agricultural policies 
of the twentieth century that enrolled the dispossessive ecologies of sheep 
and wheat against the Noongar people and their country (Mayes, 2018 ). 
Tony Hughes-d’Aeth describes the wheatbelt’s creation as nothing less 
than “a vast and almost total destruction of a pre-existing lifeworld”—so 
stark that it is visible from space (Hughes-d’Aeth, 2017 , p. 3). Its fragile 
soils have been subject to relentless tillage and burning. Salt creeps slowly 
to the surface in the absence of deep-rooted vegetation, evoking a bleak 
sense of “life trying to die or death trying to live” (Hughes-d’Aeth, 2012 , 
p. 26). These scars only hint at a profound and lasting trauma that is at 
once ecological, spiritual, social and cultural. This trauma, rooted in the 
settler-colonial logic of capitalist agriculture that exploits the earth and 
people as resources for endless extraction, is a historical fact and colonial 
present—sustained through structural imperatives and technoscientific 
imaginaries that mobilize farmers, economies, ecologies and knowledge 
systems in its service.
This chapter asks what transformational possibilities might emerge in 
this seemingly unpromising landscape. Exploring the grounded practices 
of a broad-acre farming couple and their experiments with new ways of 
knowing and farming in the wheatbelt, I argue for the possibility of a less 
anthropocentric agriculture to emerge from within the temporalities of 
global supply chains. While their farming practices are imbricated in the 
messy realities and destructive tendencies of contemporary capitalism, and 
thus enmeshed in contradictions and susceptible to co-optation, Di and 
Ian Haggerty’s farming practice nevertheless suggests ways for resisting 
the hegemonic epistemologies of commodity agriculture and reveals  K. DONATI
57
something of the incomplete and “unstable commitments” of supply- 
chain capitalism (Tsing, 2009 , p. 151). These instabilities of capitalism’s 
“blasted landscapes” are consequential, for, as Anna Tsing cautions, 
“progress still controls us even in tales of ruination”, and yet it is “not the 
only plan for making worlds” (Tsing, 2015 , p. 21).
regeneratIng  at Scale
Di and Ian grew up on multi-generational farms in the wheatbelt but have 
worked together and separately in a range of agricultural businesses from 
the Kimberley to the southern reaches of Western Australia. In the early 
1990s, they purchased a small parcel of degraded, inexpensive land next to 
Di’s parents’ farm. Cracks appeared in their own farming practices during 
the millennium drought, prompting a shift away from conventional agri -
culture. Today they seek to redress well-rehearsed fault lines of commod -
ity agriculture: intensive chemical inputs, pesticide and herbicide resistance, 
declining soil fertility and crop nutrition, land desertification and saliniza -
tion, diminished human health, biodiversity loss and climate change. The 
Haggertys, however, are motivated not by yield but by the regeneration of 
lifeworlds in the wheatbelt and beyond in ways that call into question the 
temporalities of “a productionist ethos that subjects soil care and … 
human–soil relations, to the extraction of future economic value” (Puig de 
la Bellacasa, 2015 , p. 698).
The Haggertys are not necessarily striving to shorten supply chains or 
localize markets, though during the COVID crisis they began supplying a 
local miller and baker located 190 kilometres away in Perth. Their produc -
tion system looks quite conventional—they use logistics infrastructure, 
agricultural machinery and financial systems similar to other wheatbelt 
producers. Their non-mulesed wool sells at a premium price in Europe, 
but their grain mostly enters undifferentiated global supply chains. The 
Haggertys’ farming enterprise now spans 65,000 acres through purchas -
ing or leasing adjoining farmland as it becomes available. Scale enables 
them to bring more people onto the farm and teach other ways of feeling 
and doing farming. As Ian explains: “you take some time and you explain … 
what you’re looking at and what you’re feeling [and] what they think, 
what they see”. As such, farming at scale is a deliberate strategy to “build 
that community of connectedness with the Country”. Ian adds: “If you 
haven’t inherited [land], it’s really hard to get the capital, but … there’s 
lots of really good people out there that would love to get connected with 5 GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN WHEATBELT 
58
the land and be farmers that haven’t got a chance”. Farming at scale also 
enables the Haggertys to observe and respond to how ecological processes 
such as water and nutrient cycling work across the landscape rather than 
on individual parcels of land. Newly acquired land, usually degraded and 
often saline, allows them to experiment across diverse conditions and soils.
temporalItIeS  of regeneratIon
Despite its popularity in alternative food and farming movements, regen -
erative agriculture resists definition, as revealed by a recent review of jour -
nal articles and practitioner websites (Newton et al., 2020 ). Scholar and 
regenerative farmer Charles Massy, whose 2017 book Call of the Reed 
Warbler  has been influential in shaping the discourse surrounding regen -
erative agriculture in Australia, defines it as a mode of farming that enables 
landscapes to renew themselves. At the heart of “renewal” sit the episte -
mological dimensions of agriculture. Massy contrasts the “organic” or 
ecological mind of regenerative farming with the “mechanical mind” of 
Enlightenment thinking that “paved the way for the rise of Capitalism” 
and its handmaiden settler-colonial agriculture (Massy, 2017 , p.  40). 
Maria Puig de la Bellacasa argues that the mechanistic epistemologies and 
technoscientific temporalities of productivism follow a “linear imperative 
of progress” but also a “restless futurity” that continually generates crisis 
and seeks out “hope for salvation” ( 2015 , p. 694). In the face of the exis -
tential threat of climate change, Matthew Kearnes and Lauren Rickards 
observe how regenerative agriculture and its commitments to soil ecology 
and carbon sequestration are laden with a “promissory logic and … high 
hopes for a brighter future” ( 2020 , p. 71).
Many scholars caution that the microbial turn in soil science, even 
within regenerative agriculture, is not inured to instrumentalist capture. 
Emerging scientific interests in soil life promise much for reimagining 
other soil futures yet “retain a productivist orientation” that risks com -
modifying biotic worlds (Granjou & Phillips, 2019 , p. 412). Krzywoszynska 
is hopeful about the possibilities of a probiotic soil consciousness for more 
resilient futures but remains alert to how putting soil biota to work fails as 
a disruptive force if it replicates “the same processes of alienation and 
exploitation that characterize the relations between capital and human 
labor” ( 2020 , p. 231). If regenerative agriculture merely harnesses micro -
bial life as a new frontier of cheap labour for productivist accumulation, it 
simply remakes soil life as a commodity in existing “circuits of production  K. DONATI
59
and consumption” (Patel & Moore, 2018 , p. 23). In this context, it is 
perhaps unsurprising that Nestlé, the world’s largest food and drink con -
glomerate, is celebrating its investment in regenerative farming and its 
efforts at product reformulation to lower the carbon footprint of its pro -
cessed foods (Nestlé, 2021 ). The revised narrative of progress promised 
by regenerative agriculture and circulating within global food regimes 
reveals an ecological modernism that upholds “the rationality of the mar -
ket and the economic grammar of yield, consumer demand, ethical con -
sumption, and neoliberal subjectivity” (Mikulak, 2013 , p. 46).
Nonetheless, the processes of landscape renewal called for by Massy and 
the Haggertys operate according to a rhythm not easily subsumed into the 
input–output linearity of productivism, representing a fundamental “clash 
of temporalities” between understanding soil as a “slowly renewable 
entity” and putting it to work as an “accelerated technological solution” 
that preserves the futurity of productivist agriculture (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2015 , p. 699). In her analysis of “soil care” among permaculture and bio -
dynamic practitioners, Puig de la Bellacasa attends to how “care time … is 
irreducible to productionist time” and offers “an invitation to rearrange 
and rebalance the relations between a diversity of coexisting temporalities 
that inhabit the worlds of soil and other interdependent ecologies” ( 2015 , 
pp 707–709). It is through this lens that I read the Haggertys’ natural- 
intelligence system as a probiotic practice that feeds into undifferentiated 
global supply chains and concomitantly seeks to decentre technoscientific 
temporalities and cultivate webs of multispecies care across landscape 
functions and scales.
natural  IntellIgence  aS probIotIc  governance
The Haggertys are recognized leaders in an emerging regenerative- 
farming movement that takes a keen interest in the entanglements of life -
worlds. Their farming practices reflect a “probiotic governance” that 
Jamie Lorimer describes as “using life to manage life”; these are practices 
that seek to “transform the dynamics of the ecologies with which they are 
entangled, working from the bodies of animals out to the planetary con -
centration and circulation of atmospheric gases” and, in the process, 
diverge “markedly from the command-and-control logics of modern anti -
biotic approaches to human and environmental health” ( 2020 , p. 7). The 
Haggertys’ probiotic practices begin with sowing a diversity of cash 
crops—wheat, barley, oats, triticale, plus fodder crops—using a 5 GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN WHEATBELT 
60
conventional no-till drill seeder that injects worm liquid and compost tea 
brewed on their farm directly into the soil. This microbially active liquid 
helps seedlings produce a thick rhizosheath that creates a complex root 
network before their leaves reach out for the sweetness of the sun. Growing 
deep into sandy soils and acidic subsoils, these roots improve soil structure 
and aeration while sequestering carbon from the plant’s photosynthetic 
and respiratory metabolism. Even in low rainfall, they demonstrate remark -
able capacity to source minerals, nutrients and water. Barley has proven 
particularly effective for rehabilitating saline soils. When a paddock is too 
saline even for barley, the Haggertys plant other salt-tolerant perennial 
shrubs and trees, providing habitat for insects and birds along with fodder 
for sheep. The re-emergence of native perennial grasses lying dormant in 
the soil signals that a paddock is regenerating.
The Haggertys attune themselves to dynamic ecologies circulating 
between the microbiomes of humans, sheep, soil and even the atmosphere 
in ways that exist within but also exceed the circuits of capital. Often 
regarded as a “dead, dormant, or inactive” dumping ground for carbon 
emissions, the atmosphere is “a habitat with actively reproducing micro -
bial life”, yet it is relatively neglected in regenerative-farming circles (Klein 
et al., 2016 ). Di has learned that the atmospheric microbiome comprises 
bacteria and bioaerosols that, among other things, help clouds to nucleate 
raindrops, thus attracting rain to an increasingly inhospitable wheatbelt.
The Haggertys nurture radical aspirations to create a substantial corri -
dor of diversified tree plantings that would connect their farm to other 
large-scale replantings further south, having recently leased more land at 
the southernmost point on their farm. This ambition requires time, 
resources and a certain degree of luck in accessing adjacent properties 
before they are snatched up by land speculators. They aim to cultivate rela -
tions of care at individual, regional and planetary scales between terrestrial 
creatures in need of refuge, forested landscapes and the atmosphere’s 
unknown microbial communities. This life web of multispecies care allows, 
Di explains, “all the soil microbes and the insects and the animals and so 
forth to have a refuge … when the season goes to shit and it doesn’t rain 
for the right period of time”. Over timescales that may exceed their own 
lives, the Haggertys imagine how trees might attract rain-making clouds 
and revitalize the microbial reciprocity of the soil biome, phytobiome and 
atmosphere. This attentiveness to multi-scalar, creaturely interconnected -
ness suggests, following Lorimer, how “managing microbiomes becomes  K. DONATI
61
a story of making kin across social and species difference” but also across 
temporalities ( 2020 , p. 222).
ovIne epIStemology  and paddock  thInkIng
Where the Haggertys differ most from the broader regenerative-farming 
community is in their unconventional epistemic practices for acknowledg -
ing and responding to the more-than-human intelligence of sheep and 
even paddocks. Their natural-intelligence farming system  developed 
through “hybrid epistemological work” that is informed by scientific lit -
erature in climate change, rumen health and soil biology, but also actively 
decentres mechanistic ways of knowing the world (Kearnes & Rickards, 
2020 , p. 83). Their unorthodox epistemic practices form an “unspoken 
discipline” that Ian admits they “don’t normally talk about because it’s 
not scientifically proven”. The Haggertys have experienced how unortho -
dox thinking is sometimes denigrated or dismissed as “unscientific spiri -
tual talk” within productivist circles (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 , p. 708). 
Far from unscientific, they have developed nuanced epistemic practices for 
making sense of the land, each in their own way.
Di, who manages the livestock, sees ecological renewal as co-produced 
through the nested microbiomes of sheep rumen, soil and, she hopes, the 
humans who eat her food. Her sheep graze and browse on fodder crops, 
trees and brush planted across the paddocks along with supplements of 
hay. Ensuring there is native vegetation in every paddock enhances the 
farm’s biodiversity and the dietary diversity of the flock. Sheep are the first 
step in a long process of soil rehabilitation, being fed the Haggertys’ own 
hay to avoid disrupting rumen stability as sheep move between paddocks. 
Their manure helps spread microbes; their bodies carry and distribute 
native grass seed. By keeping a self-replacing flock, lambs are exposed in 
utero  to the flavours and nutrients of the paddock; learning to eat along -
side their mothers inoculates the lamb’s undeveloped rumen microflora 
and cultivates an “intense knowledge” of their local environment, says Di. 
Over time, she has noticed sheep selecting from an increasing diversity of 
forage: “The animals seem to really blossom in their health, so that opened 
different thought patterns to us and just that interaction between their gut 
microbes and then into the soil was a lot better outcome”. Observing the 
sheep informs Di’s decisions about how to best support the intergenera -
tional transfer of ovine ways of knowing, in turn further developing the 
epistemic capacities of her sheep.5 GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN WHEATBELT 
62
Being with sheep helps Di enter into a meditative state that opens her 
mind to the paddock. It took Di years to quieten her rationalist mind and 
cultivate a more nuanced intention as she stands in the middle of a pad -
dock that feeds into global supply chains. “Too much pressure makes it go 
hairy”, she explains. “If you’re looking from a personal perspective of 
greed or whatever else, it’s going to go pear-shaped … It gives you more 
responsiveness to what’s going on around you instead of just bulldozing 
your way through.” She acknowledges that her financial stake in the land 
risks impeding her clarity in listening to what the paddock may reveal in 
that moment: “there’s some decisions that you’re making—and it is a big 
business at the end of the day—that you don’t want your own personal 
bias to influence you. You want to try and be open … The mind can lead 
you down paths that might not necessarily be for the best”. This “paddock 
thinking”, as I call it, fosters an epistemological intersubjectivity that 
acknowledges the land and animals as knowing and challenges Di to resist 
productivist temporalities and decentre their anthropocentric imperatives.
Ian, who manages the cropping, understands how easy it is to discon -
nect from the paddock when riding an enormous, air-conditioned tractor 
for spraying compost tea or harvesting: “in a 24-hour period, you can 
cover a number of paddocks—big area—and you just roll them all into 
one. But they’re all different”. He makes a point of jumping out of the 
tractor at the end of a run to ensure he accounts for these differences: 
“you’ve got to make a physical, conscious effort to take time out and look 
at each paddock—each area as an individual—because it’s too easy to bulk 
it all into one and think ‘oh yeah, while we’re doing that paddock, we’ll 
just blooming do that one in the middle …’ Two hours later, it’s gone, 
and what you did is not right for it”. Stepping out of the tractor allows Ian 
to note the paddock’s relation to wind, whether its perennial grasses are 
still green, how recently they acquired the land and its state of vulnerabil -
ity. Like Di, he consciously makes time to connect energetically with the 
land so it can guide how he proceeds: “I can hop on a machine, and I do 
one row of paddock and know this is just not right … [I] fold up and go 
and put it somewhere else because the paddock will basically just about tell 
you”. Ian feels that a genuine commitment to “getting out of your own 
self” is critical for decision-making of this kind. Difficult to articulate 
through technoscientific rationalities, it partly hinges on a temporality that 
creates a space in which “plants can articulate and humans can listen to 
voices that function without language”, albeit always imperfectly 
(Meldrum, 2009 , p. 331). Treating each paddock as a distinct collective  K. DONATI
63
enables the Haggertys to farm at scale without compromising the intimate 
relationality needed for the paddock to reveal something about itself. This 
alternative temporal approach, Di explains, means that “the paddock can 
unfold on its own terms. They show their strengths better. Some are bet -
ter as diverse grazing paddocks, and others do nicely with growing a crop”.
The Haggertys’ successes in regenerating land allow them to function 
within global supply chains. Yet earning a living from the land entails a 
delicate negotiation between the interests of the paddock and those of 
productivity. Yield is essential to the Haggertys’ economic survival but 
forms only part of the story in how ecological worlds are remade. Ian 
explains, “Sure, we want to maximise our yield where we can, but you 
don’t maximise your yield at the cost of the environment. So, the yield 
really is the last thing on the list”. Other forms of accounting are needed 
to respond to the temporalities of a paddock’s vulnerabilities and lively 
capacities. The Haggertys have learned that prioritizing yield by forcing a 
vulnerable paddock into production too early can cause a whole crop to be 
lost and add years to a paddock’s recovery. In a “forced system”, as Di 
describes it, chemical inputs compress time to extract higher yields. 
Natural-intelligence farming produces alternative temporal obligations: 
“you’ve got to work within the natural processes of that land, and it needs 
time. Sometimes it needs time just to rest, so it means it might not have a 
crop in it. It might not have animals on it. It might just be plants … sitting 
there if the seasonal conditions aren’t conducive to growth at that particu -
lar time”.
The epistemic practices and temporalities of paddock thinking were 
profoundly influenced by the years the Haggertys spent in remote com -
munities of the Kimberley. As Ian explains, “They [Aboriginal Elders] 
were displaced from the landscape, but their knowledge of Country—and 
how they looked at Country and what they expected from Country—they 
didn’t have high expectations of it … Those old fellows knew when it was 
going to rain, when it was going to be a good season, when it was going 
to be a bad season, what to do. Unless you’re a totally arrogant prick, you 
sit back and take notice of it all. It did really shape ... what we’re talking 
about: intuition, gut feeling, this connectedness”. The Haggertys make 
no claims as holders or practitioners of Aboriginal knowledge, but their 
encounters with Elders did provoke a realization that other ways of know -
ing are possible, destabilizing the hegemonic authority of the technoscien -
tific expertise they once relied upon. Through their hybrid epistemic 
practices, they have learned to demand less of the land yet, in other ways, 5 GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN WHEATBELT 
64
to ask much more of it—not in terms of yield but in what the land can 
reveal about itself.
regeneratIve  farmIng  on country
Regenerative farming at scale remains deeply imbricated within the global 
food system and yet, as the Haggertys’ farming practices suggest, it 
needn’t be subsumed within the temporalities of productivist agriculture. 
At the same time, not even the most ecologically benign agriculture can be 
prised from the colonial violence that reorganized webs of life across 
Australia. All agriculture—regenerative or otherwise—takes place on sto -
len lands. Regenerative agriculture cannot simply put Country, or boodja  
in Noongar language, to work in more ecological ways or be wielded as an 
epistemological tool for settler-colonial agriculture to think its way out of 
the mess of climate change. The push for ecological regeneration of the 
wheatbelt remains incommensurable with the Noongar pursuit of self- 
determination, land justice and spiritual healing (Tuck & Yang, 2012 ). 
Indigenous epistemologies have much to contribute to both regenerative 
agriculture and responses to the complexities of climate change, but Tony 
Birch cautions against Indigenous knowledge becoming “branded and 
packaged as a quick fix solution to climate change by retro-fitting it to suit 
Western society” ( 2017 ). However, Birch and others (Mayes, 2018 ) argue 
that growing concerns about climate change may also provide common 
ground and a shared agenda from which Indigenous communities and 
settler farmers might collaborate.
The Haggertys are clear that the project of healing Country through 
regenerative agriculture should not proceed without Noongar people. Di 
describes private land as an ownership model that operates according to 
false temporalities. “We’re only here temporarily”, she explains. “We need 
to look at different models of engagement of land and people.” At the 
time of writing this chapter, she was in the early stages of exploring a pos -
sible collaboration with a Noongar enterprise to establish its own business 
on her farm utilizing bush foods and other native plants she has cultivated.
Other opportunities for collaboration are emerging. Justin Wolfgang, 
who works closely with the Haggertys through his advocacy of regenera -
tive agriculture in WA, notes that the scale of landscape restoration that 
many regenerative farmers aspire to is hindered by the lack of tree nurser -
ies to supply them. The Noongar Land Enterprise (NLE) recently pur -
chased a nursery, now called Boola Boornap (The Place of Many Trees),  K. DONATI
65
which will raise tree seedlings endemic to south-west Western Australia. As 
NLE chairperson and Noongar business and community leader Oral 
McGuire explains at the public opening of the nursery, “many of our 
sacred trees and sacred places have been lost. So, the replenishment of 
trees into the spirit of the land is such an important part of the restoration 
and the ecological health of boodja  … we must do it with trees. Every tree 
that we grow is absolutely handled with the love and care of a baby” 
(Danjoo Koorliny, 2021 ). McGuire’s vision is that every Noongar nation 
will have its own nursery where values of sacredness, spiritual and ecologi -
cal renewal, love, and care will be made visible and given expression within 
the context of economic development. McGuire articulates a hybrid set of 
epistemological and economic practices that are underpinned by Noongar 
cultural law and intergenerational responsibility and that exist within but 
are not easily subsumed by the temporalities of capitalist imperatives. The 
nursery enterprise might draw on networks and markets of settler-colonial 
agriculture and yet remain uncompromisingly organized around the heal -
ing of boodja . If successful, this NLE model of economic development 
would enable Noongar people to work and live on Country while also 
contributing to large-scale ecological restoration.
concluSIon
Through their hybrid practice, the Haggertys negotiate a constant contra -
diction: while yield is not their primary motivation, it is a structural neces -
sity if they wish to enact wide-scale ecological transformations. They will 
not “destroy the system” (Tsing, 2009 ), but their farming is consequen -
tial, particularly if it serves to undermine the hegemonic influence of agro -
chemical industries in the wheatbelt. The epistemic pluralism of 
natural-intelligence farming does not merely put the soil to work in new 
ways. In resisting the temporalities of technoscientific productivism, webs 
of life are reorganized and practices of care are attenuated across times -
cales and species difference in ways that allow other interests in the land -
scape to surface. This offers cause for cautious optimism for how the 
“possibilities for a more livable world” might emerge, as Tsing suggests, 
even from within the wheatbelt’s most blasted landscapes ( 2009 , p. 172). 
It might also suggest how regenerative agriculture could support an alter -
native hybrid economy that “valu[es] Aboriginal work and country” in 
ways that reflect the aspirations and imaginaries of the Noongar commu -
nity (Altman, 2012 , p. 21). The disruptive potential for collaborations in 5 GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN WHEATBELT 
66
the wheatbelt ultimately rests on the extent to which sovereignty is 
acknowledged, settler epistemologies are decentred and, critically, 
Noongar strategies to work and live on Country are supported. As run -
away climate change bears down on all life, these collaborations could 
carve out the space from which a truly counterhegemonic practice of 
regenerative agriculture might emerge in Australia.

Reviving Community Agrarianism 
in Post- socialist China
Daren Shi-Chi Leung
Abstract Tasked with feeding 1.4 billion people, China often promotes 
its success in food security in relation to its self-sufficient grain production. 
In the post-socialist context, the reformist state has been pursuing a 
capital- based vertical model to integrate millions of smallholding produc -
ers into the market. Yet, the introduction of high-yield hybrid rice to 
increase production has resulted in a set of related crises, including wide -
spread environmental pollution, food-safety issues and adverse impacts on 
rural life. However, agrarian communities are challenging these state- 
imposed practices of food production. This chapter explores an endoge -
nous form of regenerative agriculture that has emerged in South China 
since the early 2000s, a Chinese form of food and farming activism for 
reviving community agrarianism. I argue that the revitalization of “tradi -
tional” farming practices as a form of xaingtu  (rural) knowledge has 
evolved with and through local peasants’ experience and struggle over the 
decades. One example that combines diverse aspects of such knowledge is 
the “fish-duck-rice paddy”, a well-known symbiotic method of pest

control that also works with native varieties, organic manure and coopera -
tive labour. This method revives peasants’ experience of the Mao era as a 
cultural reference for community  agrarianism. The revival of community 
agrarianism allows farming to be narrated as an evolving social and histori -
cal practice, not “wasting” peasants’ knowledge, in contrast to the capital -
ist agrarian transformation.

IntroductIon : FeedIng  chIna In Post-socIalIst  tImes
Today, China must feed nearly one-fifth of the world’s population—1.4 
billion people—with less than a tenth of its total farmland. Feeding China 
not only is a historical challenge in attempting to eliminate famine and 
hunger (Li, 1982 ) but also centres on a pressing series of contemporary 
issues, including declining farming labour, widespread environmental pol -
lution and recurring risks of food safety. Chinese authorities, while aware 
of these issues, insist that “in the new era, the Chinese people are more 
concerned with their nutrition and health, from having enough food to 
eating well and safely” (State Council, 2019 ). Whether the Chinese can 
feed themselves or not, feeding China, with increasingly more and better- 
quality food, indeed poses a global challenge (The Economist Explains, 
2015 ). To better understand this Chinese problem, it is necessary to take 
a perspective from the post-socialist period.
As China rejoined the world economy in the 1990s, some asked, “Who 
will feed China?” without threatening global food security and ecological 
sustainability (Brown, 1995 ). By saying, “Chinese people will feed them -
selves”, the Chinese authorities promised the world that they would 
strengthen “the motivational force” via a market economy and expedite 
“scientific and technological advances” for increasing agricultural produc -
tion of grain (State Council, 1996 ). The introduction of hybrid rice 
(zajiao shuidao ) in the 1980s is an important case. The rice could be high- 
yielding and endure large quantities of inputs like synthetic fertilizers, pes -
ticides and weed control. That “success” has served as a political and 
scientific promise in China’s ongoing politics of food security, exemplified 
by the national celebration to mark the recent death of renowned rice  D. S.-C. LEUNG
71
geneticist Yuan Longping, also known as the “father of hybrid rice” 
(Schmalzer, 2021 ).
The promise of hybrid rice worked in conjunction with land reforms 
introduced from the 1980s. The new reformist state farewelled the social -
ist period (1950s–1970s) by introducing a “new socialist countryside”. It 
dismantled collective agriculture, replacing communal production teams 
with the Household Responsibility Contract Scheme that instituted two- 
tiered land rights: land belonged to the village collective, while the right 
to use land was equally divided and land could be leased to families 
through a contract procurement system. While guaranteeing the state’s 
plan for grain purchase, the state also insisted on new arrangements for 
organising millions of agricultural producers (He, 2017 ). The reformist 
model incorporated smallholders into a market that promoted modern 
farming technology and competition while maintaining a high level of 
food security. Over the years, combining modern farming technology (like 
hybrid rice) with the marketized organization of farmers has become the 
mainstream strategy for feeding China. Yet such reform has resulted in a 
set of rural crises, commonly known as the “three rural problems” ( san-
nongwenti ) interrelating peasant, village and agriculture (Wen, 2001 ).
The dilemma of how to feed China has revealed the recurrent condi -
tions of farming in China: the land is collectively owned and farming 
methods are privatized. In the post-socialist context, socialism is no longer 
regarded as antagonistic to capitalism (Dirlik, 1989 ; Day, 2013 , p. 15). 
Similarly, Huang et al. ( 2012 , p. 140) have observed that Chinese agricul -
ture moves towards neither capitalism nor socialism but towards “some -
thing different, along the lines of marketized cooperatives, in the manner 
originally envisioned [in the Chayanovian notion of peasant family farm -
ing]”. He Xuefeng ( 2017 ) sees these new arrangements as questioning the 
peasants’ way of life as historically grounded in the idea of a “household- 
based economy”, which contracts the so-called small peasant economy in 
East Asian societies (like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan), whereas today 
farmland is more likely a profit-driven property resulting from the land- 
distribution policies of the Cold War period (He, 2017 , pp. 5–6). In post- 
socialist China, farmland that is still collectively owned supports the most 
basic means of production that “allows householders focusing on agricul -
tural production [instead of becoming rural-urban migrants]” and that 
“makes various forms of cooperation possible” (He, 2017 , p. 7).
In this chapter, I explore the politics of food and farming in post- 
socialist China with an interest in the possibilities for (re)organising farmers  6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA 
72
in ways that vary from the state’s capital-based vertical integration. My 
focus is on an alternative model that advocates for rural social revival. I 
undertake this exploration through a comparison of the cases of hybrid 
rice and eco-rice. I will examine an endogenous form of regenerative agri -
culture that has emerged in South China to argue that the revival of com -
munity agrarianism involves the creative preservation of practices peasants 
have carried forward from the socialist era, while resisting the reformist 
transformation of agriculture. Through this movement, a distinctive 
Chinese community-supported agriculture (CSA) has been taking shape 
and expanding.
the reFormIst  model For chInese  
agrIcultural  Problems
In order to solve poverty in the post-socialist period, the Chinese state 
introduced a reformist transformation of agriculture. It adopted a reform -
ist discourse of “market socialism” that frames farming labour through 
access to capital-based methods of input and output (Huang et al., 2012 , 
p.  142). The reform allowed the state to organize peasants differently, 
shifting from Mao-era rural integration of “commune-production teams- 
households” to the market-mediated linkage of “company-cooperatives- 
households” (Yan et  al., 2020 ). In the 2000s, a series of vigorous 
agricultural and rural policies was launched to “streamline” and “scale up” 
the ineffective agricultural system (Day & Schneider, 2017 ). These poli -
cies include, first, the promotion of “dragon head enterprises”—the giant 
agribusinesses that can vertically integrate households with processing and 
product markets and agricultural technology; second, the implementation 
of the Law on Specialised Farmer Cooperative that groups householders 
as an economic unit producing the same product or using the same agri -
cultural service (e.g. “one-village/cooperative-one-product”); and, last, 
the abolition of the agricultural tax to reduce the financial burden on peas -
ants. This capital-led vertical integration of agriculture was recently reas -
serted by the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 
2019 to continue the better linking of company, cooperative and house -
holds, while also celebrating its success in grain security, to bring “millions 
of small farmers onto the track of modern agricultural development” 
(State Council, 2019 ). D. S.-C. LEUNG
73
The reformist model tends to formulate “the problems of agricultural 
production as the most pressing issue for China” and “the capitalist, 
industrial forms of modernization as the most important solution”, which 
paves the way to the rise of “agrarian capitalism” (Day & Schneider, 2017 : 
p. 9; Yan et al., 2020 ). This capitalist transformation progresses the state’s 
agenda of food security with a technocratic discourse that focuses on the 
alleviation of rural poverty and the increase of agricultural productivity. 
Over the years, vertical integration has introduced further industrial and 
modern farming technologies (e.g. high-yield seed, artificial inputs and 
machineries), tending towards homogenization of various agronomic 
practices across the country (Huang et al., 2012 ). As a result, the “three 
rural problems” have intensified. Specifically, the commodification of “the 
natural land and human resource on which people’s livelihood depended” 
is expanding, as is capital-intensive, resource-intensive and chemical- 
intensive agriculture that “not only destroys nature and family but also 
homogenizes diversified rural indigenous traditional knowledge” (Wen 
et al., 2012 , p. 31). This reformist model is, as Schneider ( 2017 ) con -
cludes, “wasting the rural”, because agricultural industrialization disre -
gards the long-standing, ecologically concerned farming techniques, such 
as the use of organic manure, that Chinese farmers have worked with for 
centuries.
It is for these reasons that Chinese rural advocates have drawn public 
attention away from rural poverty to the trend of deteriorating culture and 
ecology in the countryside. One commonly posed question is how to 
“organise [rural people] to counter the power and emergence of capitalist 
hegemony within society and the market” (Day, 2013 , p.  9). As He 
Xuefeng has argued ( 2017 ), the rural crisis is far more than an economic 
problem but rather a form of social disintegration of rural community. It 
comprises the following factors:
the commodification of agricultural input, labour, public goods and techni -
cal service, a steady exodus of educated rural youth as migrants to cities, the 
aging and feminisation of rural producers, fragmentation of familial life, 
estrangement of social relations with villages, growing rural disparity, etc. 
(Yan & Chen, 2013 , p. 964)
Thus, rural advocates have called for alternative approaches to rural 
development, considering the sustainability of agricultural production in 
relation to rural livelihood (and its reproduction) and the coherence of 6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA 
74
rural society (Yan & Chen, 2013 ). One attends to the emergence of alter -
native food chains with booming CSA initiatives, ranging from CSA farms, 
farmers markets and buying clubs, to farmer cooperatives. A form of rural 
activism is emerging through these activities, leading to “a more economi -
cally viable, ecologically embedded rural development model” (Si & Scott, 
2016 , p. 1094). Despite their limited scale, it is evident that CSA initia -
tives are improving the local environment through agricultural remedia -
tion (e.g. removing pollution and contaminants) and enhancing the social 
and economic value of farmland to prevent the expansion of non-farming 
purposes of urbanization and industrialization (Kurl & Ho, 2017 , p. 844). 
Scott et al. ( 2018 ) summarize the movement as a kind of bottom-up food 
activism that brings together food safety and rural revival against the state- 
led technocratic discourse of ecological agriculture.
the rIse oF the agrarIan  renaIssance  In south  chIna
In my fieldwork on CSA in Guangzhou city, I found that it was common 
for grains like rice, wheat and millet to be sold at the monthly Guangzhou 
Farmers Market ( Chengxianghui ), in addition to fresh vegetables. “Eco- 
rice” is one such grain. It sells for double the price of regular rice, but 
consumers are keen to buy it in support of farmers growing native varieties 
in the countryside. Tracing the origins of eco-rice, I discovered what I 
term the “agrarian renaissance” movement in South China, an endoge -
nous regenerative agricultural movement that “focuses on the revival of 
peasants’ indigenous knowledge and respects peasant’s livelihoods and the 
environment” (Leung, 2021 , p. 31). Here, I dig into this more deeply to 
show that this revival involves reintroducing so-called traditional farming 
techniques and, in association with those techniques, peasants’ Mao-era 
experience in the post-socialist context. I identify an evolving form of 
xaingtu  knowledge that, according to Chinese ecological anthropologist 
He Jun’s ( 2007 ) research on “indigenous environmental knowledge”, 
rejects any static or binary thinking about traditional versus modern tech -
nologies. Rather, xaingtu  involves a socio-material approach to under -
standing farming techniques resulting from peasants’ local intergenerational 
experiences and struggles. Attention to xaingtu  prompts questions about 
farming practices that have evolved across the shifting social organization 
of rural society.
The data for examining community agrarianism is drawn from archival 
materials, field observation and interviews I conducted through the  D. S.-C. LEUNG
75
network of Partnership of Community Development (PCD). Established 
in 2001 in Hong Kong, PCD has played a key role in the introduction of 
CSA to midland China. It has also documented ways “to explore, practice 
and evaluate” the grassroots farming projects against reformist and capi -
talist models of agriculture (PCD, 2019 , p. 10). These projects were first 
trialled in South China, a traditional rice-growing region that was targeted 
by the state’s project of technological transformation through the intro -
duction of hybrid rice. According to his decade-long observation, Angus 
Lam (interview, 2019), who worked at Greenpeace from 1997 to 2007 
and is now a project coordinator of PCD, points out that the mainstream 
strategy for improving rural livelihoods “brings in modern technologies 
such as chemical fertilisers, hybrid seeds, and even invasive eucalyptus tim -
ber available from the market” that “resulted in wrecking local farmland, 
like some terraced field collapses due to soil erosion”. Meanwhile, Lam 
continues, some rural actors and groups from the fields of environmental 
protection, indigenous agricultural research, social work and so on, “began 
to attend to traditional farming knowledge with the approach of regenera -
tive or multifunctional agriculture”. In the early 2000s, PCD launched a 
series of participatory-action research projects by recruiting villagers, local 
cadres and researchers as the “community facilitators” to explore and doc -
ument peasants’ oral histories, their struggles with recent rural decline, 
and traditional farming techniques they continued to practise (PCD, 
2005 , 2019 ).
These pilot projects found that the historical root of “traditional” farm -
ing had been integrated into the collectivist agriculture of the socialist era, 
also known as Mao’s era, challenging its popular impression of “cultural 
deconstruction” or “cultural homogenisation” (PCD, 2007 , pp. 72, 94). 
The cultural exploration revealed a dynamic relationship between peas -
ants’ livelihoods, food production techniques and the health of the envi -
ronment, preserving what Schmalzser ( 2016 ) calls the indigenous 
knowledge of Maoist China. It emphasized the public service provisioned 
by the collective labour that was once maintained by the “work-point” 
system under village-based production teams and that was threatened by 
the disorganization of peasants in the reform era (He, 2017 ). Collective 
labour had long supported the establishment and maintenance of irriga -
tion (wheel watering, reservoirs, canals) in the rice paddies (PCD, 2007 , 
p. 67). It also supported customary techniques of using manure to improve 
soil health. The transformation in manure work provides a narrative of 
shifting rural knowledge. It allows us to trace the changes in the social 6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA 
76
practices of farming through peasants’ perspectives and experiences in 
relation to their livelihood dynamics, via the shifting use of chemical and 
organic manure.
According to Shi Sheungde (PCD, 2007 ), one of PCD’s community 
facilitators, there were diverse native methods for the production of 
organic manure drawn from peasants’ experience of Mao’s era long before 
the introduction of chemical fertilizers in 1985. For example, manure ( fei) 
was a combination of fermented manure mixed with human waste, live -
stock waste and weeds that was composted for a week to fully ferment as 
ripe manure (p. 56). In addition, peasants were able to experiment with 
different kinds of green manure ( lvfei)  on collective farms. They became 
proficient in techniques of cultivation and crop rotation to improve differ -
ent soil conditions, in both dry and wet fields (p. 55). “This knowledge”, 
as Shi points out, “is not only passed down from fathers to sons but is also 
common knowledge that people have been practising for a long time” 
(p. 56). Peasants are turning back to these techniques to deal with prob -
lems like caked soil, frequent pests, disease and even slowing yields, all 
caused by their adoption of modern farming. As Shi observes:
Most peasants are now using a mixed form of planting, and all dry fields are 
planted with green manure, except for the time of severe drought. This is a 
widely used technique for supplementing rice soil fertility for the local peas -
ants combined with local skills and alien crops [e.g. hybrid rice]. Since the 
1990s, the technique of [green manure] has matured and, in the lack of 
farmyard manure, it has become an important component of the local agri -
cultural system, a key strategy that does not overly rely on chemical fertilis -
ers. (PCD, 2007 , p. 56)
This agrarian narrative highlights the knowledge of farming inherited 
from the socialist era and deployed by peasants to negotiate with modern 
farming techniques in the post-socialist time (He, 2007 ). However, some 
also suggest that those customary farming practices are regarded as useless 
and even forgotten by peasants under the hegemony of modern farming 
(also see PCD, 2008 , p. 13; Dominelli & Ku, 2017 ).
There are numerous examples collected by PCD and related organiza -
tions that demonstrate that peasants are the active subjects initiating and 
innovating with such knowledge to navigate rural problems as they arise. 
The body of knowledge ranges across attitudes of stewardship, preferences 
for farming local varieties, pest prevention, the sharing of experience, 
cooperative labour and so on. One of the best examples of a suite of  D. S.-C. LEUNG
77

Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou. (Images pro -
vided by Xiangdang)
techniques that demonstrates the holistic application of such knowledge is 
the “fish-duck-rice paddy”, or yuyadao  (see Fig.  6.1). This is a well-known 
symbiotic method of pest control that replaces weedicide and pesticide 
with a traditional method that employs fish and ducks in the field to con -
sume pests and weeds. It works effectively in rotation with green manure 
(PCD, 2007 , pp. 55, 67; also see Dai & Xue, 2019 ). For PCD ( 2019 , 
p. 77), if such knowledge is revitalized, the community-based component 
would help local people and CSA practitioners to explore the historical 
changes in their village life while broadening the basis of sustainable com -
munity development.
The agrarian renaissance movement in South China renders the revival 
of peasants’ Mao-era experience visible via the continuing practice of tra -
ditional, native or indigenous farming techniques. Rather than disappear -
ing, these customary agricultural practices are thriving. As I argue, the 
approach of xaingtu  knowledge is socially engaged and historically 
grounded in particular ways. It emphasizes the agency of peasants’ 6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA 
78
collective innovation in “native methods” (peasants here refer to tufangfa , 
a Maoist term, expressed with nostalgia) to transform their local condi -
tions (also see Schmalzer, 2018 , p. 9). The embrace of xaingtu  suggests 
an alternative approach to organizing peasants—as a form of community 
making that privileges livelihood and the environment rather than the 
“wasting” of “the rural” that occurs in reformist developments. For rural 
advocates, the practice of xaingtu  knowledge ultimately reveals social 
foundations for promoting community agrarianism in which villagers and 
CSA practitioners enact a new collective form of household farming in the 
post-socialist countryside. Working in support of a different form of econ -
omy, commonly known as “community economy” in the field of sustain -
able rural development, is a key challenge for revitalizing indigenous 
farming knowledge like “fish-duck-rice paddy” (Dominelli & Ku, 2017 ; 
Wen et  al., 2012 ). As a result, reviving community agrarianism often 
involves grouping farmers together in mutual-aid groups and cooperatives 
(PCD, 2019 ). This contrasts with the state-led specialized farmers’ coop -
erative, which, as another project coordinator of PCD, Edwin Chan 
(interview, 2018), states, is an economic unit lacking “a culture of coop -
eration” for community development.

What distinguishes the Chinese CSA movement’s practice of community 
agrarianism is its alternative approach to the production of grain (specifi -
cally, rice) and the shifting experience of village peasants in relation to the 
changing history of socialism. This agricultural activity needs to be under -
stood as distinct from the increasing number of family-based CSA farms 
with consumer members operated by passionate so-called new farmers 
who return from cities (Si & Scott, 2016 ). There is also a big challenge to 
improve rural–urban relationships by reconnecting producers and con -
sumers in support of sustaining community economies. One of the urban 
obstacles goes to the prevailing context of food-safety problems. Recurring 
food scandals produce public anxiety and lack of trust in China’s chaotic 
conventional food chains, while leaving space for so-called emerging alter -
native food chains to flourish (Leung, 2021 ; Scott et  al., 2014 ; Veeck 
et al., 2010 ). Yet, civil authorities attempt to regain public trust in their 
promotion of safe, quality food sourced from urban communities, in  D. S.-C. LEUNG

contrast to the progressive but still ineffective state-led food-safety policy 
(Leung, 2021 ; Scott et al., 2018 ).
Due to such high levels of public distrust, Kelvin Wang (interview, 
2019), a rural social worker organising eco-rice cooperatives in Yunnan, 
still remembers that when CSA commenced, it often experienced poor 
sales. The movement lacked the capacity to engage consumers (also see 
PCD, 2013 , p. 97). This set of challenges led to PCD establishing a flag -
ship programme of CSA internships in rural initiatives in the mid-2000s in 
an attempt to improve rural–urban relationships and incubate a number of 
young food activists to better engage with the ever-shifting urban culture. 
As CSA interns report, successful examples of promoting practices like 
rice, duck and fish occurred when they connected with consumers’ (e.g. 
housewives’) everyday shopping experience for food safety and quality 
(see PCD, 2008 , pp. 10–12; 2009 , p. 17; 2014 , p. 158). Since then, CSA 
activists have attempted to build a stronger network at the rural–urban 
nexus (PCD, 2008 ). Over time, they have responded effectively to chal -
lenges of urban consumption, including food scares.
In recent years, there has been an emergence of urban-based consumer- 
led groups focused on incorporating urban people into the ways of caring 
for rural communities via food production. Wang Xiangdang (interview, 
2018), a CSA intern, formed Farmers’ Friend in 2006  in Liuzhou, 
Guangxi, and points out the significance of the involvement of urban con -
sumers in its rapid development: “while demanding safe and quality food, 
consumers can also be passionate, resourceful, and creative in initiating a 
consumer-producer connection via organising farmer’s market and buying 
club”. Another more convivial case is in Guangdong. According to Rao 
Qihong (interview, 2018), another CSA intern, Guangzhou Farmers 
Market was founded in 2009 originally to promote eco-rice, where “we 
use it to make sushi which consumers could try and trust themselves”. 
Over time, consumers who become volunteers and even organizers have 
developed a more participatory method to promote a consumer–producer 
connection in what I call “convivial agriculture” (Leung, 2021 , p. 32). 
Recently, the group has been more ambitious in organising the Canton 
Harvest Festival ( fengnianqing ) that brings together rural initiatives from 
across five provinces in South China (see Fig.  6.2).
By examining the case of PCD, which has nurtured food and farming 
activists from community facilitators to CSA interns, we have seen how 
community agrarianism develops in and through localized CSA practice. 
CSA now reaches through the networks of the agrarian renaissance 6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA

movement in the countryside, in the exchange of knowledge, resources 
and experiences to promote ecological farming, and then extends to urban 
areas, where consumers are encouraged to search for ways to participate in 
processes of production. Community agrarianism is thus taking up the 
challenge to transform rural–urban relations. Beyond a set of farming 
techniques, it is a method for making a shared, sustainable agricultural 
environment.
conclusIon : W hat We have shared  through  
groWIng  Food?
Community agrarianism is a distinctive arm of the Chinese CSA move -
ment in post-socialist China. Adopting the approach of xiangtu  has 
enabled farmers to apply “traditional” knowledge to positively transform 
the conditions under which they farm. Furthermore, this approach opens 
out to a wider collective effort to, as my interviewee Lam insists, “create 
the ‘commons’ for all of us”. Romanticized as it might be, creating a com -
mons, in line with J.K. Gibson-Graham’s post-capitalist perspective, is also 
a process of forming “community”. It is a process of negotiating “the 
quintessentially ethical concerns … of how we are living together” 
(Gibson-Graham, 2006a , p. 82) and that involves “struggle, uncertainty, 
ambivalence, and disappointment” and discards “any fantasy that there is 
a perfect community economy” (Gibson-Graham, 2006b , p. xv). 
Throughout my fieldwork, I have observed long-standing food activists 
enter these food scenes between the countryside and cities with joy and 
encouragement, though sometimes with frustration and difficulty. In sup -
port of the “commons”, peasants like Xiaoyue (interview, 2019), who 
struggle to fully adopt organic farming, put it simply but profoundly, “I 
feel proud of our hard work of farming that can feed the healthy land and 
feed healthy people”.
Commoning the environment can be approached by rural and urban 
communities through shared interests in food. As I and others have 
argued, an “agricultural commons” (Cameron, 2015 ; Leung, 2021 ) 
should take into account the preservation of agrarian knowledge as a basis 
for improving consumer–producer relationships. Such an approach offers 
localized knowledge in support of the booming trend of CSA farms and 
related cooperatives across the country (Cook, 2016 ). In addition, it can 
fuel a wave of community economies for rural revival through hacking 6 REVIVING COMMUNITY AGRARIANISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CHINA

ideas of ecological agriculture promoted by the state (Scott et al., 2014 ) 
that have often failed or that failed to account for the diverse farming prac -
tices of small-scale producers and the environmental concerns of 
consumers.

Fantasies of Logistics in Aotearoa 
New Zealand
Matthew Henry and Carolyn Morris
Abstract Logistics is a form of calculative reasoning and set of material 
practices framed by the fantasy of perpetual, seamless circulation. This fan -
tasy is built on ideas of universal connection and fungibility that sit beyond 
the teeming messiness of lived, unpacified life. The fantasy of connection 
is, however, continually haunted by an anxiety that an irruption of liveli -
ness will disrupt material flows and expectations of plenitude. In this chap -
ter, we draw on two case studies of food disruption from Aotearoa New 
Zealand—pork and flour—to interrogate these promises. The two cases 
take the form of vignettes when the regular operation of logistics relation -
ships was in some way affected by the COVID-19 response of the Aotearoa 
New Zealand government and other actors. We argue that the character 
and impact of the disruption experienced in each case study are specific to 
its material and cultural particularities and that the particularities of dis -
ruption themselves provide a valuable analytical entry point for under -
standing the fragility and contingency of logistics. This leads us to show 
that the critical analysis of logistics relationships needs to move beyond a

IntroductIon
Logistics is a form of calculative reasoning and associated material prac -
tices framed by fantasies of perpetual, seamless circulation resulting in 
unfailing and unending plenitude whenever and wherever it is desired. 
These fantasies are built on ideas of universal connection and fungibility 
where the goal is to tame and control the teeming messiness of lived, 
unpacified life. Such logistics imaginaries animate the extraordinarily com -
plex supply chains that coordinate producers, processors, manufacturers, 
transporters and retailers to deliver (for the middle classes at least) a per -
petual and seamless supply of food. When supply chains work as they are 
supposed to, “the entire network of infrastructures, technologies, spaces, 
workers, and violence that makes the circulation of stuff possible remains 
tucked out of sight for those who engage with logistics only as consum -
ers” (Cowen, 2014 , p. 1). And what is generated for such lucky consumers 
is a lifeworld that can be taken for granted, producing subjective, social 
and cultural security—what Law ( 2014 ) terms the miracle of things 
working.
However, logistics and supply chains rarely work as seamlessly as hoped 
and claimed (Neilson, 2012 ). While logistics operations aim to fashion 
homogenous, fungible networks, they are continually haunted by the 
threats of frictions and disruptions that plague logistics in practice 
(Gregson, 2017 , Gregson, Crang and Antonopoulos, 2017 ). The result is 
as Chua et al. ( 2018 , p. 623) warn: “we should be careful not to reify 
logistics as a seamless system of instantaneous flow and total functional 
integration”. Instead, they argue, scholars need to pay attention to the 
liveliness of logistics, the ceaseless work done to pacify that liveliness, and 
the vulnerabilities created from the calculative, material and spatial prac -
tices of circulation.
The labour of pacifying commodities into networks called “logistics” 
and “supply chains” that can be imagined and experienced as stable, pre -
dictable, controllable and enduring is Sisyphean, and the results can be  M. HENRY AND C. MORRIS

undone by things both big and small, human and non-human. This is 
because non-human actants have what Jane Bennett ( 2010 , p. viii) calls 
“vitality”—that is, they have the capacity “not only to impede or block the 
will and designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with 
trajectories, propensities, or tendencies of their own”. This vitality, or 
agency, stems from what she calls their thing-power  (Bennett, 2010 , p. 
vxi). Vitalities, vulnerabilities, threats and disruptions are actually always 
materially and culturally particular, and it is by paying close attention to 
particularities that the contingency, instability and labour of assembling 
particular supply chains becomes apparent.
In this chapter, we explore the causes and consequences of two 
COVID-19-generated supply-chain disruptions in Aotearoa New Zealand: 
those affecting pork and flour. What these events demonstrate is that dis -
ruptions are not singular, unidirectional or purely economic, as the dis -
course about supply chains and logistics might suggest. The pork 
disruption caused an economic problem for the industry, but a different 
problem for butchers and pig farmers (and processors and importers). The 
problem for butchers was managing inventory, but the problem for farm -
ers was the constant birth of piglets. Their sows’ fecundity was also an 
animal welfare problem, which is why the government intervened to repair 
the supply chain. The flour disruption, by contrast, was a consumer dis -
ruption and a disruption to subjectivities. The problem was how to get 
enough flour to make home-made sourdough to photograph for Facebook 
and Instagram—it was a problem of performing a certain kind of class and 
family identity.
coVId-19 In AoteAroA  new ZeAlAnd
When examining systems that seem to run seamlessly, it is imperative not 
to be seduced by the system’s logics, as though those logics effortlessly 
translate into actually existing relationships. We need to pay attention to 
turbulence, liveliness and particularity in logistics, and these ideas apply 
equally to the wider contexts within which these supply chains emerge and 
perform. Aotearoa New Zealand has had (and continues to have) a very 
particular experience of COVID-19 and its impacts. The strategy was to 
“go hard and go early” and eliminate the virus. Despite the tragedy of 
individual deaths (26 in the first wave), there has not been the horror of 
mass death, and Aotearoa New Zealanders have come to live with and, on 
the whole, willingly accept strict controls on their movements and give 7 FANTASIES OF LOGISTICS IN AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND

support to the government’s shift from a business focus to one primarily 
concerned with public health. Indeed, we finalized this chapter under the 
conditions of a second national lockdown that was swiftly announced and 
almost universally seen as prophylactic necessity.
On 28 February 2020 the first case of COVID-19 entered Aotearoa 
New Zealand via a woman returning from Iran, and cases continued to 
grow quickly through March. The country’s borders were closed to non- 
citizens and non-residents on 19 March, and on 21 March the govern -
ment announced a plan to deal with COVID-19 via a four-level alert 
system, with increasingly strict restrictions imposed at each level. On 23 
March the government announced that in 48 hours’ time (at 11.59 pm on 
25 March), Aotearoa New Zealand would move into level-four lockdown 
for a minimum of four weeks. This meant that all educational institutions 
and non-essential businesses and workplaces were closed, and people were 
instructed to isolate themselves in their own homes. Passed as an emer -
gency response, the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act  2020 granted 
the government extraordinary powers to enforce lockdown regulations, 
the extent of which had not been seen outside of wartime. During the 
lockdown, essential businesses, including supermarkets but not all food 
retailers, remained open, while export-oriented agricultural processors 
continued to operate. It was the lockdown specifically that disrupted the 
pork and flour chains, requiring (and achieving) reordering.
too MAny PIgs
For a country that exports 85 per cent of the meat that it produces, pork 
production is anomalous because the 600,000 pigs raised each year (by 
fewer than 100 commercial growers) are solely destined for the domestic 
market (NZ Pork, 2020 ). From peaks through the 1930s and 1960s, 
domestic pork production has become an increasingly marginal activity, 
with significant declines in piggeries and pig numbers caused by static 
demand and the loss of cheap feed (whey) from the dairy industry. Indeed, 
Aotearoa New Zealand has become a pork importer, with almost 60 per 
cent of pork and 85 per cent of cured products such as bacon coming from 
cheaper large-scale producers in places such as Australia, Spain and the 
United States (NZ Pork, 2020 ).
Before COVID-19, the risks experienced by pig farmers already encom -
passed competition, animal welfare and biosecurity anxieties (NZ Pork, 
2020 ). The African Swine Fever (ASF) pandemic that re-erupted in 2018  M. HENRY AND C. MORRIS
91
resulted in the pre-emptive slaughter of millions of pigs across China, cre -
ating fears in the pig industry that the disease might enter Aotearoa New 
Zealand via pork imports (Standaert, 2020 ). The cheapness of imported 
pork, driven by economies of scale, was placing domestic pork producers 
under financial pressure, and this pressure was amplified by public cam -
paigns against rearing practices such as farrowing crates. One response to 
these pressures, led by the industry’s statutory board, NZ Pork, was a 
campaign for the introduction of mandatory country-of-origin labelling 
to counter the persistent invisibility of pork imports for domestic consum -
ers (NZ Pork, 2020 ). However, despite the campaign’s success, the intro -
duction of the new labelling laws was an early casualty of COVID-19’s 
emergence in Aotearoa New Zealand as the government’s energies shifted 
to counter the impact of the pandemic.
Aotearoa New Zealand’s domestic pig farmers funnel their production 
through three main processors, Freshpork, Five Star Pork and Wilson 
Hellaby, which in turn supply supermarkets, retail butchers and the hospi -
tality sector. The level-four lockdown of March 2021 required all non- 
essential businesses to close. In the days prior to the national lockdown, 
there had been heavy buying of a range of foodstuffs, including meat. This 
splurge had encouraged retail butchers to order additional supplies on the 
assumption that they would remain open over any lockdown as an essen -
tial service. However, the government drew a very tight boundary around 
what it deemed to be essential, and both butchers and the hospitality sec -
tor found themselves outside that boundary as supermarket-centric logis -
tics, and supply networks were prioritized ( Fortune , 2020 ).
At the stroke of a pen, the definition of retail butchers as non-essential 
created an immediate issue for butchers as to how to get rid of their excess 
stock and a looming challenge for pig processors and farmers (Martin, 
2020 ). Just as retail butchers found that they could not get rid of pork, 
pigs continued to be ready for slaughter. As well as being distinctive by 
being domestically focused, the pork industry is different from other red 
meat supply chains in that it is not tightly organized around seasonal 
rhythms of supply: the pork industry has evolved to supply a continuous 
flow of meat all year round. This particular relationship to time is materi -
ally embedded in infrastructures such as freezers and piggeries. Prior to 
lockdown, 12,000 pigs were being killed weekly, and the closure of retail 
butchers, restaurants and so on meant a surplus of 5000 pigs per week 
(NZ Pork, 2020 ). Freezing pig carcasses and holding them in cold storage 
was an immediate response, but in a trade shaped by the logics of ceaseless 7 FANTASIES OF LOGISTICS IN AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND 
92
flow and just-enough storage, freezer space quickly filled up. A system that 
delivered plenitude began to choke on its own surplus as pig numbers in 
piggeries burgeoned and consumer demand fell away with cafes and res -
taurants closed. This was enough to trigger widespread animal welfare 
concerns about the overcrowding of pigs and the threat of pigs being 
euthanized inhumanely at piggeries (which would in turn have generated 
the problem of the uncomfortable optics of carcass disposal).
Intense lobbying by the pig industry failed to achieve the redefinition 
of retail butchers as essential, and the problem of the surplus continued to 
grow through lockdown. However, other ways of managing the surplus 
emerged out of discussions between industry and government (Rae, 
2020 ). The majority of Aotearoa New Zealand’s pork is imported, and 
those imports were themselves being disrupted by the strains being placed 
on global shipping connections. Much of the imported pork was used by 
domestically based processing companies such as Wilson Hellaby to man -
ufacture small goods such as bacon and ham (much to the pre-COVID-19 
annoyance of pork farmers). The government and NZ Pork lobbied 
importers and processors to prioritize the use of local, fresh pork over 
frozen imported pork. This rerouting of pork flows was unusual in that it 
represented a renewed willingness of state agencies to become involved in 
questions of logistics that had been traditionally marked off as the preserve 
of private companies. The active role of the state in redefining and rerout -
ing food-supply networks reached a peak in May 2020, when the govern -
ment announced a scheme where it would buy 2000 surplus pigs a week, 
process them and distribute the meat to Maori iwi, community organiza -
tions and food banks. By August 2020, the government had spent $5.7 
million and produced the equivalent of 1.7 million meals for distribution 
to over half a million people (Malthus, 2020 ). In a quiet but telling 
moment, the state had actively intervened to resolve a problem of over -
supply. In this episode, the enduring instability of food systems, when 
confronted with the task of reconciling the needs of material bodies, lim -
ited infrastructure and the thwarted logics of flow, was illuminated.
the “g reAt” Flour  short Age oF 2020
Media reports on 31 March 2020 said that stories of flour shortages were 
circulating on Facebook and Twitter (Kirkness, 2020 ). The reason for the 
shortage was initially identified as unnecessary panic-buying: “There’s 
enough flour to go around, people are just buying it too fast, ANZ  M. HENRY AND C. MORRIS
93
supermarkets say. It has forced the country’s major supermarket chains to 
again plead with the public not to panic-buy, purchasing only what they 
need” (Kirkness, 2020 , sentence 1–2). By the next day, a supply-chain 
cause of the shortage was identified. However, this was not a problem with 
the supply of milling wheat or a problem with milling capacity.
Retail flour—that is, flour sold directly to consumers—normally 
accounts for less than 10 per cent of the 225,000 tonnes of flour milled 
annually in Aotearoa New Zealand, with the majority being distributed by 
tanker to bread manufacturers and the rest delivered in 20-kilogramme 
bags to smaller bakeries (Lawrence, 2020 ). What flour millers were expe -
riencing was a surge in demand for domestic-sized packages of flour. 
Farmers Mill in Timaru, for example, reported that within a few weeks, it 
had packaged the quantity of 5 kilogramme flour bags it would usually 
pack in four years (Lawrence, 2020 ). Similarly, Champion Flour reported 
a 500 per cent increase in demand for small-bagged flour (Checkpoint, 
2020 ), and supermarket chain Foodstuffs reported that between mid-May 
and mid-June 2021, it had sold 1500 tonnes more flour than it had in the 
same period of the previous year (New Zealand Flour Millers Association, 
2020 ). Despite the fact that 75 per cent of Aotearoa New Zealand’s mill -
ing flour is imported from Australia, there was no reported disruption to 
the supply of flour itself. Instead, the disruption to the domestic flour sup -
ply chain was caused by lack of packaging rather than lack of flour: “Getting 
packaging normally took anywhere from six to nine weeks so the issue was 
not producing the flour, it was how to get the flour produced into small 
packages and into the supermarkets” (Lawrence, 2020 , sentence 9).
The question then shifted from the causes of the shortage to the causes 
of the demand, and cultural explanations emerged. The dominant narra -
tive was that Aotearoa New Zealanders were enacting a more “traditional” 
family life in the altered domestic conditions that lockdown produced:
Many Kiwis have been posting their frustration and bewilderment about the 
lack of flour as they reignite the cooking days of old. Uber Eats and 
McDonald’s have been taken away, so many parents are dragging their 
 children to the stove top to see what they can create together. (Feek, 2020 , 
sentence 3–4)
The cafes aren’t open, the restaurants aren’t open, we’ve got children at 
home, we’re locked down and we’re looking to reconnect with our home 
baking, which is wonderful in the long-term. (Checkpoint, 2020 , sentence 7)7 FANTASIES OF LOGISTICS IN AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND 
94
Another commentator wrote that the lockdown provided “a great 
excuse to get into the kitchen as a family and do some from scratch cook -
ing that we probably didn’t have time to do pre-lockdown. Whatever the 
reason, convenience seemed to have taken a back seat during lockdown as 
Kiwis rediscovered their inner bakers, she said” (New Zealand Flour 
Millers Association, 2020 , sentence 8–9).
Within a couple of days, the story had disappeared from the main -
stream media, but it continued to circulate on social media, where people 
shared intelligence about which shops still had flour. A little smugly, those 
with flour posted photos of the cakes and bread they had baked. Partly 
because of the flurry of media attention, the flour shortage was in some 
ways an enjoyable experience. The government’s decision to eradicate the 
virus had protected the population from the brutal realities of sickness and 
death that characterized many countries’ experience of the pandemic, and 
most people were freed from pressing economic insecurity by income- 
support schemes, so for many Aotearoa New Zealanders the lockdown 
was quite exciting—we were part of the most important thing happening 
globally: we were having a COVID-19-caused shortage. Within 10 days 
or so, the shortage was over. I suspect that what happened was that people 
who wanted flour had stockpiled enough—18 months later, one of the 
authors of this chapter (Carolyn) has almost managed to use up the flour 
they bought at the beginning of the lockdown, while the other (Matt) has 
10 kilogrammes still waiting to be used.
The flour shortage was brief, and there was no shortage of manufac -
tured bread and baked goods at the supermarket (i.e. no one suddenly 
went hungry). From a consumer point of view, the flour supply chain 
somehow magically repaired itself.
The flour supply-chain disruption was not a problem with flour but 
with a taken-for-granted but overlooked actor in the chain: a particular 
size of paper bag. It was not so much a disruption for the industry, and in 
fact the shortage was in all likelihood a boon to flour producers, as con -
sumers not only bought more flour than usual but bought greater quanti -
ties because of the lack of small bags. Instead, the disruption was a 
consumer one, caused by a run on flour as Aotearoa New Zealanders 
in lockdown sought comfort (and something to do) by baking. What was 
disrupted was not so much actual lived life but two fantasies: the fantasy of 
subjective and familial security promised by home baking as a way to deal 
with the profound insecurity generated by COVID-19 and the fantasy of 
unfailing plenitude promised by supply-chain capitalism. M. HENRY AND C. MORRIS

conclusIon
These two small and comparatively insignificant cases of disruption pro -
vide a valuable analytical entry point for understanding how actually exist -
ing supply chains work—as opposed to the fantasies of how they are 
supposed to work. Just as supply chains are particular, so too are the things 
that disrupt them. The overarching disruption was COVID-19, but it was 
the lockdown that was imposed to eliminate the virus that was the proxi -
mate cause of the disruptions. In the case of pork, lockdown severed con -
sumer access to a set of retail networks, and, in the case of flour, generated 
a surge in demand, animated by the desire to perform certain subjectivi -
ties. And the actors and their thing power that actually disrupted the sup -
ply chains were particular (and non-human): in the case of flour, it was the 
absence of correctly sized paper bags; in the case of pork, it was pig live -
ness and the fact that the sows continued to blithely birth, unaffected in 
their reproductive impulses, which did not shut down even as human 
social and economic life did. Both cases illustrate the problems generated 
by the practices of trying to meet the promises of perpetual plenitude: 
Fordist pork production, the everyday miracle of the replenishment of the 
supermarket shelves, and the bewilderment that ensued when the magic 
no longer worked. The ceaseless labour of pacifying commodities into 
supply chains is usually invisible, but it was revealed by these disruptions. 
However, the flour chain repaired itself and within a few days the shortage 
was over. The pork chain, by contrast, presented a more critical challenge 
(because pigs are living animals) and so the state intervened to stop an 
animal welfare disaster, an unusual step in an economy that prides itself on 
its neoliberal, market credentials, especially in relation to food and agricul -
ture. What these small events show is that critical analysis of logistics rela -
tionships needs to move beyond a mirroring of claims to universality. 
Great insights are generated through attention to the specific materialities 
of things and their liveliness.

Reproducing Hunger in Pandemic America
Maggie Dickinson
Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a significant rise in 
hunger in the United States, especially among caretakers of children, peo -
ple who are unemployed or insecurely employed, undocumented immi -
grants and other racialized marginalized groups. The gaping holes in the 
public response to growing hunger are the inevitable result of decades of 
welfare state transformation in which policymakers have withdrawn assis -
tance for caregivers and reframed public benefits as a subsidy to low-wage 
jobs. In the face of mass unemployment and life-threatening risks for 
frontline food workers, hunger is once again being deployed as a tool to 
push people into unsafe jobs that prop up a racist and ecologically destruc -
tive food system.

One of the many ways the economic fallout from the pandemic has become 
legible to the public eye in the United States is through the rising visibility 
of hunger and food assistance. Early on, images of cars lined up for miles 
to collect food from food banks captured public attention. Demand at 
food banks across the country has been unrelenting. In October 2020, 
distributions from the not-for-profit organization Feeding America’s net -
work of food banks and pantries were up by 52 per cent on the monthly 
average before the pandemic. This increase does not include the contribu -
tions of the mutual aid groups that sprang up in communities across the 
United States to get food to elderly people, immune-compromised people 
and those otherwise in need. According to the Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities, the available data suggest that between 6 and 7 million 
more people applied and were approved for SNAP (food stamp) benefits 
in the first six months of the pandemic. This rise is unprecedented: at the 
onset of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008, it took nearly a year 
and a half to add this number of people to SNAP. This outpouring of 
pandemic-related food assistance has stemmed the tide of increasing food 
insecurity. Overall, food insecurity rates held steady in 2020 at 10.5 per 
cent of the US population, thanks to the expansion of both food and cash 
assistance (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2021 ).
However, like so many aspects of the pandemic, not all residents expe -
rienced the economic fallout in the same way. Reporters and commenta -
tors celebrated the “good news” that government intervention kept food 
insecurity levels stable during the economic upheaval of the pandemic. But 
as Ashanté Reese points out, a closer look at the data exposes the role rac -
ism plays in determining who goes hungry in the United States (Reese, 
2021 ). Prior to the pandemic, Black and Latinx households were more 
likely to experience food insufficiency than white residents. The fallout 
from the pandemic and the response to it exacerbated these disparities. 
Even with the increase in food assistance, levels of food insecurity for Black 
households increased from 19.1 per cent in 2019 to 21.7 per cent in 2020, 
while food insecurity rates for white residents fell from 3.3 per cent in 
2019 to 3 per cent in 2020 (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2021 ). In this racially 
segregated country, hunger can be mapped geographically. The most 
acute need is in areas where the majority of residents are Black or Native 
American. Black residents living in the South saw a greater increase in food 
insecurity in 2020 than other regions of the country (Coleman-Jensen 
et  al., 2021 ). Of the top 25 counties with the highest projected food  M. DICKINSON
101
insecurity rates, only four—all in Kentucky—are majority white 
(Strochlic, 2020 ).
The experience of food insecurity in the United States is also condi -
tioned by gender. The people tasked with the socially reproductive labour 
of caring for and raising children are structurally more vulnerable to hun -
ger. Households with children saw an increase in food insecurity in 2020 
from 13.6 per cent to 14.8 per cent. Single mothers of children were hard -
est hit, with 27.7 per cent of these families experiencing food insecurity in 
2020 (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2021 ).
And yet none of this is new—even before the pandemic, hunger was an 
intractable problem in the United States, despite a massive expansion of 
food assistance in the twenty-first century. Nearly 40 million Americans 
received SNAP in 2019. The level of distribution of food-stamp rolls never 
really fell after the Global Financial Crisis began. Significantly, the vast 
majority of non-disabled, working-age adults on the SNAP rolls were 
employed. Soaring unemployment has exacerbated food insecurity in the 
United States, but having a job was hardly a solution to hunger before the 
pandemic—in 2019, unemployment was at its lowest rate in generations, 
yet 46 million people were sourcing food from a food bank. Despite a vast, 
growing food safety net that has continually expanded through the twenty- 
first century, 35 million people in the United States were food insecure in 
2019. What is now clear is that more food assistance has not led to less 
hunger. Furthermore, the food crisis associated with the pandemic is a 
continuation of pre-pandemic hunger politics in the United States.
This gets us to the crux of the matter: hunger and poverty are perma -
nent features of capitalist society—even in so-called good economic times. 
Our systems for preventing hunger are intentionally fragile and have 
emerged from a set of contradictory social forces. Our food safety net is 
massive, complex and not up to the task of making sure everyone who 
lives in the United States has enough to eat.
Work attachment and enforcement are the guiding ethos behind the 
current configuration of the US welfare state, and they are also at the 
heart of the utter failure to prevent a spiralling hunger crisis during the 
pandemic, particularly in communities of colour and among women car -
ing for children. There has been tremendous resistance to maintaining 
supplementary unemployment payments and general cash payments 
because employers were concerned that people might refuse jobs (and 
get in the way of profit making). However, one form of assistance has 8 REPRODUCING HUNGER IN PANDEMIC AMERICA 
102
been swift, generous and uncontroversial and that is charitable food 
assistance. This is the other aspect of the food safety net that we need to 
think about.
Charitable  Food
Often called emergency food providers, soup kitchens and food pantries 
have evolved to become a permanent feature of the sprawling food safety 
net in the United States. These seemingly voluntary efforts have been 
summoned into being by federal funding over the last 40 years. Prior to 
the passage of The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) in the 
early 1980s, food banks were small, rare, shoestring operations. Federal 
funding gave communities an incentive to establish food banks. And it was 
a very successful incentive. In 1979, there were 30 emergency food pro -
viders across New  York City. Today there are over 1100. From March 
2020 until the election of the Biden administration, the federal govern -
ment dedicated $4.5 billion to emergency food providers while refusing to 
increase the value of SNAP or—better yet—provide people with sufficient 
cash assistance to enable them to stay home in order to help contain the 
pandemic. These public–private partnerships are staffed by volunteers—
typically women—who do the hard work of keeping their communities 
fed. But the institutions operate primarily as sites for absorbing agricul -
tural surplus and corporate food waste. Charitable food has become a 
safety valve for large agri-food industries, where overproduction and waste 
are part of the business model. These efforts also cheaply provide food for 
the most excluded, such as undocumented immigrants who are structur -
ally barred from accessing social programmes and are particularly vulner -
able to economic exploitation due to their legal status, and informally 
employed or unemployed people who cannot access wage supports.
Rather than employers absorbing the costs of social reproduction by 
offering time off, decent wages and flexibility for caretakers, or the state 
providing a social wage, either through direct cash support or expanded 
public services, the state offers economically insecure people food assis -
tance. This assistance is geared towards staving off the worst effects of an 
exploitative capitalist system that demands more paid and unpaid labour 
from poor people, including engaging in time-consuming efforts to meet 
their basic needs, like waiting in long lines for food boxes (Elliott et al., 
2021 ). As the working class absorbs these costs associated with social 
reproduction, wealth continues to accrue to the very richest in our society.  M. DICKINSON
103
Our food safety net is entirely compatible with systems of capitalist accu -
mulation, and that is why food assistance has become one of the go-to 
solutions to increased poverty and insecurity. It is the most thinkable solu -
tion because it is being used to grease the wheels of labour exploitation, 
not only by cutting assistance to poor families but also by effectively sub -
sidizing low-wage work and encouraging community organizations to 
take responsibility for poverty and hunger by raising an army of voluntary 
labour to repurpose agribusiness food waste (Dickinson, 2020 ).
SoCial  reproduCtion  and the devaluation  oF labour
The speed-up that women experienced during the pandemic, continuing 
to absorb socially reproductive labour alongside the push into low-paid 
employment, captures the unitary nature of the contemporary capitalist 
system. In a capitalist economy, there is a tendency for the wage relation -
ship to shape all other relationships, including relations between spouses, 
children, parents, extended families and fictive kin. The labour associated 
with life-making, life-sustaining work in the home—such as caring for 
children, making meals, grocery shopping—are typically obscured through 
the ideology of the private family and the dogma of personal responsibility 
(Fraser, 2016 ). The situation many women and caretakers found them -
selves in during the pandemic—caught between a collapsing labour mar -
ket, the demands of caring for children and a system of social supports that 
fails to adequately provide for people’s basic needs—was simply an inten -
sification of the pre-pandemic conditions they had endured. The federal 
government’s absolute refusal to provide people with supports, such as 
regular cash payments and rent cancellation, and its bowing to pressure to 
keep the economy running by forcing people back to work despite an out- 
of- control, deadly virus have exposed the conditions low-income caretak -
ers have been living with for a very long time, both in the home and in the 
workplace. The commitment to work enforcement on the part of the state 
in the face of the pandemic has intensified a long-standing hunger crisis 
for the racialized groups who have disproportionately struggled with food 
insecurity for decades.
The disproportionate impact of hunger on women with children, and 
on Black and Latinx households is unsurprising given the ways the pan -
demic has decimated the sectors of the economy dominated by these 
groups. Job losses have been concentrated in low-wage sectors such as 
leisure and hospitality, education and health services, and retail. Employers 8 REPRODUCING HUNGER IN PANDEMIC AMERICA 
104
cut 140,000 jobs in December 2020. Stunningly, women accounted for 
all the job losses, losing 156,000 jobs, while men gained 16,000. Another 
survey found that Black women and Latinas lost jobs in December, while 
white women made significant gains. The instability and insecurity of the 
low-wage labour market has only become more insecure and unstable, as 
job losses have been concentrated in low-wage industries.
Food workers are some of the lowest-paid, least secure workers in the 
economy. They are more likely than workers in any other industry to rely 
on public benefits like SNAP because their wages are so low. In large part, 
this is because work that makes life possible, such as growing and cooking 
food, has long been relegated to women and racialized groups of people—
from immigrants working in the fields, and enslaved people before them, 
to domestic workers and restaurant staff. These workers, viewed as cheap 
and disposable before the crisis, are now deemed essential—which, as oth -
ers have noted, really means they are being treated as sacrificial (Gidla, 
2020 ). They are being asked to risk their lives for paltry wages and with 
few protections so that the rest of the community can eat. Food workers 
are making terrible choices between going to work and risking illness or 
quitting the job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. A Long 
Beach grocery-store worker, profiled in an article on grocery chains clos -
ing stores in order to avoid paying locally mandated pay increases for these 
frontline workers, was quoted as saying she considered quitting out of fear 
of the virus but ultimately realized it was impossible because “I needed the 
money” (Bravo, 2021 ).
One study found that working-age adults in California had a 22 per 
cent increased risk of dying. But for agriculture and restaurant workers, 
that risk doubled to 40 per cent and for Latinx workers in those industries 
it was 60 per cent. In the food sector, restaurant and agricultural workers 
have been hit hardest, but warehouse, delivery, grocery and retail workers 
are also dying at higher rates (Chen et al., 2021 ). Outbreaks of coronavi -
rus have been concentrated in meat-packing plants, as plant owners have 
lobbied the federal government to absolve them of any liability when 
workers fall ill or die due to conditions in these plants. Of course, the fami -
lies of food workers are also at higher risk. Only 13 states have included 
frontline food workers in the first wave of people eligible for the vaccine. 
In the face of mass unemployment and life-threatening risks for frontline 
food workers, hunger is once again being used as a tool to prod the people 
who do this life-sustaining work into unsafe jobs. Work enforcement poli -
tics—which dominates our approach to hunger and poverty in the United  M. DICKINSON
105
States—is aimed at making sure that the only way people can get money is 
by working for wages (Peck, 2001 ). This political commitment has turned 
the emergence of a dangerous novel virus into a protracted catastrophe on 
multiple fronts, including an escalating hunger crisis.
There is more than enough food for everyone living in the United 
States today—we throw away 30 −40 per cent of the food we produce. 
People go hungry because they cannot lay claim to the food that exists. 
Most often, it is because they are un- or underemployed or their pay is too 
low (Dickinson, 2020 ). SNAP benefits help, but they are based on the 
thrifty food plan and do not provide enough to cover the costs of an entire 
month’s worth of food. Most people run out of food stamps by the second 
or third week of the month. Food banks do what they can, but they are 
not designed to fulfil people’s entire food needs either. The efforts made 
to get food to people in this moment are important, but they are not 
enough, because the food safety net is designed to manage a racialized 
labour force, not to decisively end hunger.
Cultivating  CallouSneSS
What the pandemic has unmasked is the centrality of death to the func -
tioning of capitalism. The push to keep the economy open in the United 
States has clearly demonstrated that our economic system is premised on 
putting some people in danger and accepting their deaths as the price of 
doing business. We knew that opening restaurants and bars, and keeping 
meat-processing plants pumping out supply with no protections, meant 
that some of the people doing that work would die (Douglas, 2020 ). The 
prevalence of food insecurity among these same groups, racialized workers 
engaged in life-making labour, is part and parcel of an extractive economic 
system dependent on the vulnerability of food workers.
The fact that capitalism produces excess and unnecessary death is not 
new. Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s definition of racism as “the state sanctioned 
or extralegal production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulner -
ability to premature death” is useful here (Gilmore, 2007 ). But the expo -
sure to premature death is typically only visible to those directly affected 
by it—people who can see, every day, the physical, mental and emotional 
costs of a labour system that hastens death. For people higher up the 
income scale, and for policymakers in particular, these impacts often 
remain inchoate, subject to the need for investigation, requiring data and 8 REPRODUCING HUNGER IN PANDEMIC AMERICA 
106
statistical picturing to confirm the truth of the matter. These techniques 
allow both callousness and indifference to flourish.
What have also been revealed are instances of concrete attempts to cul -
tivate callousness about these inevitable deaths, particularly as the toll 
mounted. White supremacist small-business owners storming state capi -
tols demanding an end to public health restrictions left no mystery as to 
the risks they were willing to take with their employees’ lives. We were all 
asked to not care as policymakers refused to extend supplementary unem -
ployment benefits in an attempt to force people back to work as the pan -
demic raged on.
There was a heightening of the contradictions under these circum -
stances. All of the reliable tropes that typically inure us to violence and 
death—whether fast or slow, structural or more immediate—didn’t work 
in the same way in the face of a global pandemic. Characterizations of 
people as criminal or lazy that have been deployed to justify repressive 
policies from police murders to welfare reforms fell away in the face of the 
very real health risks we were all experiencing. Rather, we were confronted 
with the risks others were asked to take each time we ventured out to the 
grocery store.
In the absence of well-worn racialized tropes justifying why people 
needed to be disciplined into waged labour, we saw a rise in consciousness 
around the relative value of people’s lives and well-being under an exploit -
ative capitalist system. There was a countervailing rise in disgust at the naked 
appeals to accept preventable death as the price of doing business. There 
was a rejection of callousness, as there often is when economic pain is under -
stood as occurring through no fault of your own (Dauber, 2013 ). We are 
beginning to see the fruits of this countervailing rejection of callousness. 
From the uprisings in summer 2020 that demanded recognition that Black 
lives matter to the resistance of workers refusing to return to exploitative, 
dangerous and unforgiving low-wage jobs, we are seeing an emergent con -
sciousness around the value of life and life-making. How these nascent shifts 
in consciousness might shape the politics of hunger remains to be seen.

The Pandemic Supermarket
David Boarder Giles
Abstract During the COVID-19 pandemic, this chapter argues, the super -
market became one of the most important sites in which the conditions and 
contradictions of capitalist food chains, laid bare by the crisis, were worked 
through, normalized and sustained. If supermarkets and grocery stores rep -
resent the archetypal endpoint of the value chain for commercial food sys -
tems—the interface between customer and commodity, where its value is 
realized—the social reproduction of this cultural logic in the face of unset -
tled circuits of production and consumption is indeed “essential” labour. 
But it is essential for deeper reasons than those highlighted in public dis -
course. This chapter describes the labours of employees and owners in a 
single independent grocery store in the Melbourne Central Business District 
over 18 months of lockdown, recession, and personal and economic uncer -
tainty. It captures some of the innovations, improvisations and expressions 
of solidarity made both possible and necessary in the anticipation of an 
eventual return to “business as usual”. These experiences throw into relief 
the supermarket’s function as a definitive node that articulates the supply 
chains, consumer publics and regimes of precarious migrant labour that 
constitute the urban food system as a domain for the expropriation, circula -
tion and accumulation of surplus value.

The SpecT acle of ScarciTy
“I started just around when COVID was starting to hit”, Girish told me. 
Originally from Nepal, he studies accounting and works at my local super -
market in the Melbourne Central Business District (CBD). He’s been 
there since March 2020. “My first thought was, ‘one or two months and 
this will be gone’”, he said. That was 18 months ago. I’ve gotten to know 
Girish and his coworkers quite well since then. For weeks on end, they 
were some of the only three-dimensional faces I saw when I left my apart -
ment for one of the four reasons permitted under Victoria’s stage-four 
lockdown: buying groceries. Below, I digest their impressions of the 
pandemic.
“It was funny”, Girish told me, “I had like an intuition, one day. I was 
just about to come to work, and the weather was a bit dark and gloomy. 
Weather like a scene from a movie. And I told my brother-in-law, ‘This is 
weird … I think something is going to happen’. And I came to work that 
day. And I think after two to three days of that, we went to lockdown”. 
He’s not alone in trawling the filmic imaginary to render a crisis intelligi -
ble when more quotidian vernaculars fail to furnish working heuristics. As 
in disasters of the past, before official or collective responses had con -
gealed, the interruption of social, economic and political life was framed in 
the popular imagination by familiar stock narratives of scarcity (see 
Beaumont, 2014 ; Kierner, 2019 ). Thus, inchoate existential uncertainties 
gave way to culturally coded panic, with corresponding consumer tactics: 
people stocked up.
Ubiquitous toilet paper shortages were the tip of the iceberg. “We had 
run three counters there”, Girish told me of the panic buying that charac -
terized the first few weeks of the initial lockdown. “All our counters were 
busy—like [with] three people working the counter, our lines extended 
back to the back door … Every counter, all the lines were to the back of 
the door. And it did seem like a scene from a movie. Like, people holding 
toilet paper, and pasta, and canned food, and chips and stuff … like this 
thing is really happening. People are doing it.” The spectacle of long lines 
and bare shelves itself became a trope rehearsed in the nightly news, a 
recursive semiotic (news-imitates-life-imitates-disaster-fiction) with which  D. B. GILES
111
to make sense of the early days of the crisis. “As soon as the lockdown 
started”, Girish told me, “what you heard around the news, that was hap -
pening in our store. People were really clambering about toilet paper. 
After that, two to three days later, we started putting on the limits on our 
things. Like pasta—two packs of pasta and one toilet paper, per transaction”.
In these moments, the familiar forum of the supermarket became a 
cipher for the opaque alterity of the coronavirus pandemic (both the epi -
demiological phenomenon and the corresponding sociocultural, political 
and economic event). Evacuated shelves and panicked consumers became 
the imaginative landscape within which the crisis was worked through. In 
this chapter, I argue that supermarkets and grocery stores became a critical 
site of social reproduction, where anxieties about the virus and deeper 
political and economic tensions were rehearsed, regulated or resolved. 
The labour by which this was accomplished was surely “essential” labour 
but essential for deeper reasons than those typically highlighted in public 
discourse; it was deployed in the social reproduction of capitalist relation -
ships of labour and consumption (Stevano et  al., 2021 ; see also 
Bhattacharya, 2017 ).
Perhaps even more than other retailers, supermarkets trade in a senso -
rium of abundance, predictability and mundane domesticity. They repre -
sent a cornerstone of the household imaginary, the consumer oikos that is 
one of the fundamental social units that organize capitalist social relations 
(Cooper, 2019 ). Grocers and other food retailers therefore lean heavily on 
visual signifiers of bounty and affluence to encourage consumption; full 
shelves are prioritized to inspire consumer confidence and desire—even if 
much of that food goes unsold (Stuart, 2009 , p. 27). In this way, they are 
a simulacrum of the surfeit of the consumer with the global market at their 
fingertips.
But for the same reason, they are haunted by hunger. The empty shelf 
repels customers (Stuart, 2009 , p. 17), emanating a horror vacui that taps 
into latent awareness of the scarcity manufactured by capitalist value 
chains. Customers intuit that markets do not distribute resources effi -
ciently according to need and that food and shelter are wasted in the face 
of food and housing insecurity (Springer, 2020 ). News media underscored 
this with images of food stocks destroyed by farmers and wholesalers dur -
ing the pandemic due to labour shortages and interrupted supply chains—
juxtaposed with long lines at foodbanks and welfare offices (see Dickinson, 
this volume). Although Australian authorities suggested otherwise, from a 9 THE PANDEMIC SUPERMARKET 
112
certain perspective, it was entirely rational to hoard food, toilet paper and 
other goods.
At the outset of the earliest lockdowns, this incipient consumer panic 
became a self-fulfilling prospect. Stocks that usually would have lasted for 
two to three weeks lasted for two to three days. “As soon as the lockdown 
hit”, Girish told me, “we were out of everything”. The pandemic instantly 
revealed both the vulnerability and the obscurity of our supply chains.
In this context, the pandemic supermarket served a more specific func -
tion than the mere satisfaction of sustenance—which, after all, has been 
accomplished in myriad ways during moments of both acute and long- 
term capitalist crisis, from May 1968’s rural–urban cooperatives to the 
ever-growing foodbanks of the contemporary charitable sector, or indeed 
grassroots mutual aid networks serving, especially vulnerable individuals 
under lockdown. In contrast, the pandemic supermarket maintained the 
logic of capitalist production and distribution. The job of grocery clerks 
like Girish, therefore—from the performance of reassurance and normalcy 
to the enforcement of social distance—worked with and within the eco -
nomic and social shocks of the pandemic to recuperate them under the 
organizing principles of a consumer oikos.
The paradigma Tic commodiTy  conTexT
The supermarket is one of the quintessential mechanisms by which the 
commodity form is normalized and sustained with respect to the food 
system. Supermarkets and grocery stores, perhaps more than any other 
retailer, represent the archetypal endpoint of the value chain for our com -
mercial food systems—the interface between customer and commodity, 
where its value is worked through. They instantiate a paradigmatic “com -
modity context”, as Arjun Appadurai might have called it ( 1986 ), wherein 
the product is apprehended qua product and its value realized. They 
therefore reinscribe the food commodity as a fetish—obscuring the condi -
tions of its production and distribution that confer value upon it (Dixon 
et al., 2014 ). Yet in this way, supermarkets also represent a cipher for the 
entire chain (see also Giles, 2016 , 2021 ). They are its fundamental hori -
zon and compass point.
As Wolfgang Fritz Haug ( 1986 ) reminds us, no commodity’s value is 
ever certain. He builds on Marx’s insight that capitalist value is a kind of 
“social hieroglyphic” ( 2000  [1865], p. 475), a subjective expression of 
the social relationships of production, distribution and consumption that  D. B. GILES
113
propel commodities into circulation. As such, that value remains fungible 
and unrealized right up until the point of sale, where it performs its “salto 
mortale” (Haug, 1986 , p. 23), the death-defying leap from virtual to con -
crete. This leap cannot occur in a vacuum, of course. Haug suggests that 
its trajectory is defined by contexts and pathways of commodity aesthet -
ics—such as those created by retail environments. In other words, its value 
is reckoned at each turn through affective and aesthetic judgements, in a 
cultural context where those judgements are rendered sensible (in both 
senses of the word). His insight helps us to begin to think about what kind 
of place a supermarket is.
Haug was writing in the 1970s, at an inflexion point, when the variety 
and volume of supermarket offerings was beginning to grow remarkably 
in industrialized nations (Goldfrank, 2005 ), corresponding to growth in 
both consumer and commercial food waste (Rathje & Murphy, 1992 ; 
Stuart, 2009 ). In many ways, the subsequent decades have been a period 
in which the commodity’s value has been increasingly driven by such 
affective determinations, although not limited to aesthetics narrowly 
understood. The post-Fordist era, as theorists like Antonio Negri ( 1992 ) 
and Maurizio Lazzarato ( 2006 ) have argued, has been one defined not 
solely or even primarily by the industrial labour of producing goods per se 
but by the “immaterial labour” (or “biopolitical production”, if you prefer 
their alternative formulation) of remaking social relationships of all kinds, 
all in the service of remaking our relationship to goods themselves. Indeed, 
according to Lazzarato, the postmodern commodity is an object primarily 
defined by information and affect. We can understand the supermarket, 
then, as a site of immaterial labour and biopolitical production par excel -
lence, both congealing, rendering and making legible otherwise obscure 
supply chains and entangling our household rhythms with the commodity 
form, normalizing its part in our very sustenance. In other words, it is not 
the labour of producing that material use value that will be bought and 
sold for a price but rather the labour reproducing the mechanism by which 
exchange values (specifically) and exchange value (in general) are realized.
And in the face of crisis—or indeed, crises, as the pandemic revealed 
and provoked countless underlying contradictions and instabilities, both 
specifically in the food system and in late capitalism at large—as a com -
modity context, cipher and horizon for late-capitalist food chains, the 
supermarket and its immaterial, affective labours also served to restabilize 
the food commodity form in the face of pandemic shocks to the system.9 THE PANDEMIC SUPERMARKET 
114
In this context, the pandemic threatened the fates of business owners, 
grocery workers and commodities themselves with parallel forms of aban -
donment or abjection, as food lingered overlong on the shelves, employ -
ees lived in increasing uncertainty regarding visas and employment 
pathways, and owners hung anxiously on the sparse traffic of shoppers that 
kept them from going under. In their everyday biopolitical labours, these 
stakeholders instantiated such entangled urban circuits of value and loom -
ing dereliction. Their innovations, improvisations and expressions of soli -
darity were made both possible and necessary in the anticipation of a 
“return to normal”. Those adaptations and normalizations—by which 
some novel version of business-as-usual was established—are the stuff of 
immaterial and affective labour. Such labour was essential to the mainte -
nance of the supermarket as an ongoing matrix for the realization of the 
food commodity form.
obScure  Supply  chainS  and inScruT able demand
Obscure supply chains and inscrutable demand characterized much of the 
pandemic for my interlocutors at the supermarket. By definition, of course, 
the introduction of a pathogen that avails itself of human connectivity 
disrupts relationships across the social fabric, including those relationships 
of production, distribution and consumption for which the supermarket is 
a translation matrix. In the process, however, the pandemic revealed how 
opaque or ineffable those relationships had often been.
For example, while the initial avalanche of sales was the most spectacu -
lar, headline-grabbing consequence of the pandemic for the grocery retail -
ers, the more enduring implication—at least for the store in question—was 
the attrition of sales afterwards. Within a week or two of panic buying, 
demand dried up. Under Victoria’s stage-four restrictions, the store saw 
up to a 60 per cent drop in receipts. Even months after the end of 
Melbourne’s longest, 112-day lockdown, and a putative return to “nor -
mal” during the city’s relatively long period of relaxed restrictions in early 
2021, with fewer people working in CBD offices and fewer attractions to 
draw them back, sales had fallen far short of pre-pandemic rates. “Our 
bosses thought that demand would be high”, said another clerk, Thapa, 
describing initial attempts to stock the store, “but they were wrong”.
Of course, the experience of distinct kinds of supermarkets in different 
locales varied widely, with some noting reduced patronage as customers 
avoided leaving the house (Castelló & Casasnovas, 2020 ), while others  D. B. GILES
115
(especially those offering delivery services) recorded greater sales as cus -
tomers stayed and ate at home (Stewart & Stewart, 2020 ; Troy, 2021 ). 
However, the unevenness of the transformation of commercial food chains 
is precisely part of the point. Even under relaxed restrictions and a partial 
“return to normal”, for the CBD supermarket in question, demand 
remained less predictable—not only in scale but in kind. As Naresh, who 
has worked there for three years, explained to me, they had to check the 
shelves more regularly to see what had and hadn’t sold in a given period. 
Product waste was less predictable and more common as a result, employ -
ees told me.
Indeed, as widely reported elsewhere, each of the employees I spoke 
with told me waste was a fundamental feature of the pandemic disruptions 
at my local supermarket. Products typically never thrown away before, like 
soft drinks and chocolate bars, were wasted in great quantities early in 
Victoria’s first lockdowns. The same pattern of waste was repeated, to a 
lesser degree, at the outset of the city’s subsequent “snap” lockdowns. 
Some unsold items were retrieved and replaced by suppliers—a common 
element of the commercial compact between wholesaler and retailer. And 
much of the excess was donated to food recovery charities such as Second 
Bite, who fed people who might otherwise have been buying groceries 
from supermarkets before the crisis. Indeed, in this respect, the pandemic 
consolidated a growing trend towards the joint enclaving of both com -
mercial food surpluses and economically surplus, or precarious, communi -
ties in marginal disciplinary spaces like food pantries—a joint distribution 
of wealth and waste (Giles, 2016 ). Additionally, some of the excesses went 
home with supermarket employees (some small compensation for their 
diminished hours). And a great deal of food was placed in the bin. Fresh 
produce was the major thing that needed to be thrown away, Naresh told 
me. And indeed, throughout the lockdown, the neglected, wilted and 
overripe produce I found on the store’s shelves remain one of the most 
emblematic signifiers of the breakdown of market norms—a far cry from 
the aesthetics of abundance that characterized the typical pre-pandemic 
supermarket.
With stock that would previously have lasted a matter of days now sit -
ting on the shelves for weeks, deliveries from the supermarket’s parent 
company—also its primary supplier—were ratcheted down from every 
week to every three weeks. And while that supplier still delivers 90 per 
cent of the store’s stock, according to Thapa, its supply chains were none -
theless disrupted in a range of ways. Thapa remembered, for example, the 9 THE PANDEMIC SUPERMARKET 
116
strange experience of trying to restock toilet paper following the initial 
panic and being delivered only a single pallet—much less than ordered. 
Throughout the first year of lockdown, there were other shortages of vari -
ous products for reasons similarly inscrutable from the vantage point of 
the aisles—blueberries, raspberries or limes, for instance (the latter of 
which briefly tripled in price).
Maybe most telling was the long, anxious process of sourcing new stock 
when the existing suppliers failed. Girish told me about days on which his 
boss was up until two in the morning looking for new sources from which 
to order product. One of the owners himself told me that he’d been forced 
to devote time and effort to liaising in new ways with other retailers and 
restaurants across the CBD. Despite its putative role as the holistic prism 
through which value chains are refracted, when the usual, familiar chan -
nels are disrupted, those value chains turn out to be profoundly opaque, 
hidden from even the buyers—those agents who are ostensibly best placed 
to engage with and evaluate them.
This obscurity was captured perfectly—and not without some cheek—
by Thapa, who told me about a conspiracy theory that had circulated 
among some of his friends to account for the toilet paper shortages. Since 
China produces a great deal of the country’s toilet paper, they reasoned, 
Chinese authorities must be deliberately throttling down the world’s sup -
ply for their own nefarious reasons. It’s telling that this was a more con -
crete account of the supply chain than any other Thapa had at hand.
eSSenTial  labour
In spite of these disjunctures, what struck me most about the day-to-day 
operations of the store was, simply, that they went on . The experience 
employees described was of arriving at a new normal, however temporary. 
This ersatz normality not only assimilated new biopolitical regulatory 
apparatuses, both directly (as when health agencies visited the store to 
ensure compliance) and indirectly (as when some customers began to 
object to employees touching their food), but also recalibrated and reart -
iculated new forms of market sociality, in order to allow the supermarket 
to continue to perform its primary function as the horizon of commercial 
food chains in pandemic flux.
If, as I have argued above, the supermarket is a site par excellence of 
immaterial, affective production—whose chief “product” is the hegemony 
of, and our own routinized relationship to, the edible commodity  D. B. GILES
117
form—then the work of incorporating the pandemic into that relationship 
is an “essential” form of labour. Indeed, pandemic transformations of the 
food system also bolstered alternative forms of food distribution, yielding 
new markets for retail delivery models such as Amazon Fresh (Stewart & 
Stewart, 2020 ; Hobbs, 2020 ) and new grassroots mutual aid networks, 
deploying non-market care packages of food and other necessities (Sitrin 
& Sembrar, 2020 ). The pandemic therefore threw into relief the everyday 
affective and “phatic labour” (Elyachar, 2010 ) that reproduces the 
cultural- economic context of the supermarket (see also Tolich, 1993 ). 
What was most essential was its role in working through the pandemic 
within the commodity context of the supermarket and vice versa.
It is telling, for example, that—whereas I was perhaps expecting to 
encounter stories of exploitative hours or unpaid overtime under pan -
demic duress, along with hostility and disrespect from anxious customers, 
along with racist overtones, considering that the grocery workers I spoke 
with were all South Asian—what I heard were stories of gratitude and soli -
darity in the face of adversity. Employees spoke with deep relief of the 
owners’ refusal to sack any staff, even those to whom “JobKeeper”, the 
federal wage subsidy instituted during the first year of the pandemic, 
wasn’t available due to their temporary-visa status (although hours were 
inevitably reduced as a result). And staff told me happily of customers’ 
consistent, dutiful, respectful observance of new regulations such as social 
distancing and the wearing of face masks. The production of this convivial 
setting (however constrained by the mood of life under lockdown) was a 
crucial component of their work.
This essential labour is also skilled labour . Consider the work of com -
modity aesthetics for which each of the employees was responsible; in the 
face of sparse and sedentary shelf stock, the staff did what they could to 
approximate the sensory environment of the paradigmatic supermarket, 
rearranging goods to minimize bare shelves and reminding customers of 
their desirous relationship to the commodity. Further, considering the 
inescapable amount of waste described above, staff were obliged to do 
what I have elsewhere called the “work of waste-making”—the subjective 
valorization and devalorization of shelf stock that consigns some items to 
the bin in order to lend more currency to the remaining goods (Giles, 2021 ).
And in addition to being skilled, the work of reproducing the pandemic 
supermarket is precarious  labour—often done for relatively low wages by 
people who are under pressure or vulnerable as a result of their status. 
Most staff were students on temporary visas. They are highly educated and 9 THE PANDEMIC SUPERMARKET 
118
correspondingly highly skilled, but only entitled to work a limited number 
of hours, not entitled to the JobKeeper wage subsidy, and living in ongo -
ing uncertainty about their status and future in Australia.
The pressures were myriad. One colleague had returned to India per -
manently because he found life under these conditions unsustainable. 
Others anxiously searched for full-time employment, as their visa require -
ments had apparently recently changed. Others were separated from fam -
ily, including a new child born in India after the borders closed. Others 
were forced to seek support from the Red Cross. These, too, are the costs 
of reproducing the pandemic supermarket—the material externalities of 
“immaterial” labour.
Indeed, some of my interlocutors were precisely the people Prime 
Minister Scott Morrison had expressly told to leave at the outset of the 
pandemic—and the point was not lost on them. As Naresh told me, 
“Australia has got a bad reputation from the time of COVID, how they 
have managed international students here. And obviously, the word of 
mouth spreads so fast … Because Scott Morrison said to just go home. 
You know, that has a direct impact on how people treat temporary resi -
dents here. You know what I mean? If a leader says, ‘We’re all in this 
together so we should be together’, that would have changed the perspec -
tive of how we go about it”. Naresh hastened to add that, in spite of being 
frontline workers, they were not afforded priority access to the vaccine in 
the way that healthcare and aged care workers were. To people like 
Morrison, Naresh is at the end of the food chain in more ways than one.
concluSion
Capitalist food chains were, paradoxically, both unsettled and entrenched 
by COVID-19. And nowhere were pandemic foodways more simultane -
ously exceptional and quotidian than at the supermarket. Grocery stores 
represented a critical site of social reproduction, where the political- 
economic conditions and contradictions revealed by the crisis were worked 
through, reconciled or normalized—or at least bracketed and 
neutralized.
If supermarkets and grocery stores represent the archetypal endpoint of 
the value chain for commercial food systems—the interface between cus -
tomer and commodity, where the commodity’s value is realized—the 
social reproduction of this cultural logic in the face of unsettled circuits of 
production and consumption is essential labour. But it is essential for  D. B. GILES
119
deeper reasons than those highlighted in public discourse about this 
emerging category of work. The efforts of employees and owners in a 
single independent grocery store in the Melbourne CBD over 18 months 
of lockdown, recession, and personal and economic uncertainty represent 
in microcosm the affective and phatic functions of this essential labour. 
They throw into relief the supermarket’s role as a definitive node that 
articulates the supply chains, consumer publics and regimes of precarious 
migrant labour that constitute the urban food system as a domain for the 
expropriation, circulation and accumulation of surplus value. Their inno -
vations, improvisations and expressions of solidarity were both possible 
and necessary in the anticipation of an imagined return to “business as 
usual”. In the process, they renegotiated and remapped the unsettled 
landscape of urban food chains and maintained the integrity of the com -
modity context upon which so many of us relied to sustain ourselves.

Disruption as Reprieve?
Jon Altman and Francis Markham
Abstract It is a truism that the impacts of any crisis always fall unevenly. 
In this chapter, we focus on the experience of COVID-19 by a particular 
population group, Indigenous Australians living in extremely remote cir -
cumstances. Here key responses to the disruption wrought by the pan -
demic have paradoxically registered as reprieve. In Australia, remote-living 
Indigenous peoples live in deep poverty and were anticipated to be highly 
vulnerable to food insecurity and supply chain disruption. Surprisingly, the 
pandemic served to disrupt in other ways. The hegemonic characteriza -
tion of welfare-dependent Indigenous peoples as morally deficient sub -
jects in need of discipline and control could not be sustained as the country 
“locked down” and over a million others became “welfare dependent” 
overnight. Unemployment benefits were temporarily doubled, and oner -
ous work-for-the-dole mutual obligations eased. This essay explores

potential positive changes to systems of food provisioning caused by gov -
ernment responses to COVID-19. The remote food security “crisis” is 
shown to be mainly an artefact of government policies designed to punish 
the poor and push unemployed remote-community residents into jobs. 
We propose permanent reform to the social security system that will 
enhance food security and liberate Indigenous peoples to more effectively 
self-provision and exercise “food sovereignty”.

Food Pricing  and Security  in remote  
indigenouS  auStralia
When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived on Australian shores, measures 
were quickly enacted to protect the Indigenous residents of remote regions 
whose poor health status rendered them particularly vulnerable to the dis -
ease (Keene, 2020 ). In late March 2020, remote communities were 
declared restricted zones under the Biosecurity Act  2015 (Cth), with entry 
only allowed for those delivering essential services including food. In early 
April 2020, a Food Security Working Group was established by the 
Australian government. And then in May 2020, the Minister for Indigenous 
Australians established a parliamentary inquiry into food pricing and food 
security in remote Indigenous communities. We both provided submis -
sions to this inquiry (Altman, 2020 ; Markham & Kerins, 2020 ). At the 
same time as these Indigenous-specific actions were being implemented, 
broader measures were introduced to bolster the livelihood circumstances 
of all Australians who were economically impacted by the lockdowns that 
have become an enduring feature of Australia’s effort to manage the 
spread of the virus. Of relevance to this essay was the introduction of a 
coronavirus income supplement to all unemployed Australians, among 
whom Indigenous Australians are disproportionately represented. This 
one measure effectively doubled the income of 38 per cent of Indigenous 
people (Markham et  al., 2020 , p.  6). Further, with lockdown, mutual 
obligation “work for the dole” requirements were relaxed as a social- 
distancing measure. This was especially relevant for remote-living 
Indigenous Australians, as their income support was conditional on  J. ALTMAN AND F. MARKHAM
127
extremely onerous work-for-the-dole requirements, with harsh financial 
penalties for non-compliance (Staines et al., 2021 , pp. 10–12).
In December 2020, the Report  Food Pricing and Food Security in 
Remote Indigenous Communities  (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020 ) was 
released. It found that food costs are very high in many remote communi -
ties, reinforcing long-held concerns regarding food security for Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander peoples, many of whom live in deep poverty. 
Such concerns had been articulated by several government inquiries in the 
last decade (Fredericks & Bradfield, 2021 ) and had even been the subject 
of a now defunct National Strategy for Food Security in Remote Indigenous 
Communities, introduced by the Council of Australian Governments in 
2009 as an element of its Closing the Gap policy framework. But the 
report found no evidence of systemic price-gouging taking place in remote 
community stores, nor of significant food shortages—concerns that had 
triggered the parliamentary inquiry. Optimistically the parliamentary com -
mittee noted the positive impacts of two new institutions, the Food 
Security Working Group and the Supermarket Taskforce, established in 
2020 in response to the pandemic.
The report’s 16 recommendations focused on technical and surveil -
lance interventions that the committee expected would apply downward 
pressure on food prices at remote stores and ensure that healthy fresh 
foods were available. Only one recommendation referred to the need for 
locally sourced food, focusing on local commercial market gardens and 
animal husbandry rather than fishing and wild harvesting of bush foods, at 
which many Indigenous people are especially adept. There was no serious 
engagement by the parliamentary committee with two key issues that we 
raised in our submissions (two of 126 received), based on community- 
based research on economic well-being in remote Indigenous communi -
ties. First, given the workings of supply chain capitalism, food prices in 
remote stores inevitably will be high. The payment of the Coronavirus 
Supplement in 2020 provided a natural experiment on how the alleviation 
of deep poverty might enhance food security in a context where food 
prices are high. Second, institutional arrangements like mutual obligation 
limited opportunities for self-provisioning. The liberation of the unem -
ployed from mutual-obligation requirements, combined with extra 
income, allowed some people to visit their customary lands and engage in 
self-provisioning. It is these two forms of livelihood and well-being 
reprieve during the early days of the pandemic disruption that we explore 
in this essay.10 DISRUPTION AS REPRIEVE? 
128
long SuPPly  chain: exPenSive  Food and low incomeS
Remote and very remote Australia as officially classified today accounts for 
86 per cent of the Australian continent; this classification clearly demon -
strates a dominant market-capitalist and settler-state perspective from the 
highly urbanized, densely settled parts of Australia. The dots on the map 
are discrete Indigenous communities, so termed for demographic (most 
residents are Indigenous) and historical (most of the larger places were 
colonial settlements; the small ones are more recently re-established 
homelands) reasons. There are about 1000 discrete Indigenous communi -
ties with a population of about 90,000–100,000 people (10 per cent non- 
Indigenous), serviced by 200 community stores. While most of the small 
communities have no store, a few of the larger ones have more than one. 
Much of this information is cartographically depicted in Fig.  10.1.
People in these communities live at the end of long distribution and, 
more importantly, fragile supply chains, whether their store food origi -
nates in Australia or overseas. It is inevitable that 1000 discrete Indigenous 
communities in tropical and desert Australia will experience supply chain 
challenges. Indeed, it is remarkable that fresh and processed foods rou -
tinely reach these extraordinarily remote places by road, sea and air deliv -
ery, especially when the rugged terrain and extreme seasonality and 
associated periodic isolation of many places are considered.
The small size of communities eliminates access to supermarket chains 
and oligopoly wholesale outlets. Inevitably, food supply comes at a high 
price, something that has been recognized and clearly documented for 
decades now, most regularly by the Northern Territory Market Basket 
Survey, conducted every two years for the past two decades. Small markets 
and limited buying power, lack of retail competition, high freight and 
associated cool-storage costs all add up: that is the way market capitalism 
works. Numerous reviews that we refer to in our submissions indicate that 
a “healthy” food basket costs 20–60 per cent more in remote Indigenous 
situations and 60–68 per cent more using point-of-sale data at 20 
remote stores.
One broad response to this situation is to reduce the cost of store- 
purchased food, as in the parliamentary committee’s recommendations, 
which look to lower prices through price monitoring, infrastructure 
improvements and other technical interventions into store and supply 
chain management. This mirrors the approach generally taken in the pub -
lic health literature on food-security interventions. The other, which we  J. ALTMAN AND F. MARKHAM
129
Fig. 10.1 Discrete Indigenous communities in remote Australia
favour, is to raise cash income levels in remote communities to allow for 
the purchase of food at what are inevitably higher prices.
Most Indigenous people in very remote Australia (53 per cent) live 
below the poverty line (Markham & Biddle, 2018 ). This rate has increased 
significantly between 2006 and 2016. This is partly explained by an 
increase in Indigenous unemployment: in very remote Australia the 
Indigenous employment rate declined from nearly 50 per cent to 30 per 
cent between 2006 and 2016; it is the lowest in the country. The preva -
lence of remote Indigenous poverty is the single greatest contributor to 
food insecurity. The Australian Bureau of Statistics National Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey  (ABS, 2019 ) asked participants if 
they ran out of food and were unable to buy more in the past twelve 10 DISRUPTION AS REPRIEVE? 
130
months. In very remote Australia, 43 per cent of Indigenous people 
reported experiencing such food insecurity in 2018–2019. In a submis -
sion to another parliamentary inquiry and using the best available epide -
miological evidence, we noted that a combination of low income, limited 
choice and high food prices is literally killing Indigenous Australians 
(Markham & Altman, 2019 ).
During the first year of the pandemic, as a series of supplements were 
paid to the unemployed, declining from $550 per fortnight (April–
September 2020) to $150 per fortnight (1 January 2021–31 March 2021) 
before ending (Staines et al., 2021 , p. 13). These supplements resulted in 
dramatic decreases in Indigenous poverty and markedly enhanced food 
purchases. For example, Outback Stores ( 2020 ), a publicly owned remote 
community store management corporation, reported a 75–100 per cent 
increase in sales between April and June 2020. The Arnhem Land Progress 
Aboriginal Corporation ( 2020 ), an Indigenous-owned corporation, 
reported that retail sales increased by 200–300 per cent over the 
same period.
The COVID disruption provided a rare form of social experimentation 
that is only possible during exceptional times. The raising of incomes for 
all by as much as 26 per cent not only offset the high price of purchased 
food for a time but simultaneously allowed Australia to start to address its 
international commitments to eliminate poverty and hunger by 2030 in 
accord with Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 of the UN Global 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
There are two starkly contrasting views here. The parliamentary inquiry 
focused on issues of competition and price monitoring, transport and 
refrigeration infrastructure, and store regulation and monitoring. In short, 
the inquiry’s considered view of poverty and hunger in remote Indigenous 
communities exhibited a concentrated technical focus on the supply chain. 
We, on the other hand, use information from the COVID income- 
supplementation period to highlight the inadequacy of social-security pay -
ments that include a Remote Area Allowance that still fails to reflect the 
higher cost of living in remote Australia. After a six-month period of the 
gradual tapering down of the COVID supplement, the JobSeeker rate was 
increased by only $50 per fortnight from 1 April 2021. The experiment of 
poverty alleviation is now over, and the majority of remote-living 
Indigenous Australians have now returned to a life of food insecurity, liv -
ing at the end of the global food supply chain. J. ALTMAN AND F. MARKHAM
131
Short  SuPPly  chainS : SelF-ProviSioning
In precolonial times, Indigenous people everywhere in Australia exercised 
food sovereignty and enjoyed diverse forms of self-sufficiency by utilizing 
the natural environment and its resources. This mode of production was 
disrupted by colonization, dispossession and settler-state domination that 
only occurred in some of the remotest parts of the continent after the 
Second World War. The transformation from self-provisioning societies to 
the income poverty and high levels of dependence on store-bought foods 
evident today involved extremely complex processes: we can explore such 
processes in only a cursory manner here.
There is limited empirical information about the extent of Indigenous 
people’s self-provisioning across the more than 6 million square kilome -
tres of Australia we now term remote and very remote. The information 
that is available and summarized by Buchanan ( 2014 ) and Ferguson et al. 
(2017 ) indicates that contemporary self-provisioning occurs at varying 
levels of significance. Statistics from the National Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Social Survey that we summarized (Altman, 2020 ; Markham 
& Kerins, 2020 ) indicate that between 72 per cent of adults in remote 
Australia in 2008 and 79 per cent in 2014 reported participation in some 
hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild foods. While the survey data on 
participation is far from comprehensive, it is unlikely that such high levels 
of effort were undertaken without reward.
Despite the numbers, there is an escalating government project to 
impose a market mentality on remote-living Indigenous people. This proj -
ect is ideologically underpinned by what Martin and Yanagisako ( 2020 ) 
have identified as a modernist teleological vision of a future in which wage 
labour would expand across the world. Hence, the coercive policy of puni -
tive workfare for the unemployed aims to prepare them for paid employ -
ment even in situations where employment opportunities are deficient or 
absent, and labour migration is not countenanced as an option by most 
unemployed.
To challenge and potentially upend the dominant discourse promoting 
market capitalism as the only means for poverty alleviation and food secu -
rity in remote Australia, we propose an alternate Indigenous perspective: 
hunting and harvesting of naturally occurring foods as a form of self- 
provisioning, sometimes referred to as food sovereignty. Our proposal is 
not for some return to pre-colonial subsistence living but rather for an 10 DISRUPTION AS REPRIEVE? 
132
enhancement of livelihoods, especially for the unemployed, who might be 
well placed to supplement store-purchased foods with self-provisioning.
In Fig.  10.2, we illustrate the extent of Indigenous landholdings in a 
Western legal sense, following land rights and native title reparation pro -
cesses since the 1970s. This is a map that we have developed and updated 
on several occasions since 2015 (Altman & Markham, 2015 ). The totality 
of these holdings, sometimes referred to as “the Indigenous estate”, cov -
ers more than half of remote and very remote Australia, comprising 4 mil -
lion square kilometres. In terms of the supply chain heuristic examined in 
this book, the map highlights the proximity of discrete Indigenous com -
munities and resident landowners to sources of naturally  occurring foods 
rather than remoteness and transport challenges for accessing pur -
chased food.

133
What is especially significant is that native title law confers a set of rights 
and interests on Indigenous landowners that include the right to hunt, fish 
and forage on the land and waters; have access to and use of the natural 
waters of the land; and have a right to share or exchange subsistence and 
other traditional resources obtained on or from the land. While the law 
stipulates at section 211(2) of the Native  Title Act  1993 (Cth) that such 
rights are limited to satisfying the personal, domestic or non-commercial 
communal needs of native-title holders, the distinction between commer -
cial and non-commercial is an arbitrary colonial imposition that Indigenous 
people constantly challenge. To secure such rights and interests, a claimant 
must prove continuity of custom and tradition that is everywhere inclusive 
of animals, plants and other natural resources. This is an extraordinary 
resource right over a massive Indigenous jurisdiction. Hence, our use of 
the term “food sovereignty” is not speculative or conceptual. Rather, we 
recognize that Indigenous groups retain sovereign and legally recognized 
rights to lands and the food sources they provide on a continental scale.
COVID-19 policy shifts from April 2020 saw a punitive social-security 
approach suspended to facilitate social distancing. Although conducting 
research based on direct observation has been impossible because of lock -
downs and the operation of biosecurity laws, there has been indirect evi -
dence that both the Coronavirus Supplement and the suspension of 
mutual obligations have had positive impacts on self-provisioning for two 
main reasons.
First, as Markham and Altman ( 2019 ) have quantitatively demon -
strated, the imposition of financial penalties for breaching mutual obliga -
tions reduced the incomes of the unemployed by an estimated 6 per cent. 
Such penalties further impoverished those already living below the poverty 
line. The suspension of mutual obligations and penalties would have con -
versely lifted people’s incomes by this amount alongside the Coronavirus 
Supplement.
Second, as the unemployed were freed from mutual obligation require -
ments that required the able bodied to turn up for make-work and train -
ing daily for at least four hours under the Community Development 
Programme, they were able to visit, and in some cases, move back to, their 
customary lands to self-provision. Available qualitative research summa -
rized by Staines et al. ( 2021 , pp. 14–15) indicates that with additional 
income and available time, people were able to visit their Country and 
participate in hunting and gathering activities. Smith et al. ( 2020 ), work -
ing in the Northern Territory, report that “more people are going out 10 DISRUPTION AS REPRIEVE? 
134
camping and fishing … eating that bush tucker again … looking more 
healthy” and getting “away from the worries of town”. In Arnhem Land, 
it was reported that people were returning to their Country to live in less 
crowded and healthier housing and source and eat bush foods 
(Altman, 2020 ).
In short, we argue that the perceived food security “crisis” in remote 
indigenous Australia is in large measure an artefact of pre-pandemic gov -
ernment policies that invariably impoverish the disproportionately high 
number of Indigenous unemployed. Such impoverishment can be offset in 
part by activating local and regional food supply chains. As the unem -
ployed enjoyed more income and freedom in 2020, there was enhanced 
self-provisioning. Alongside enhanced purchase of food from stores, addi -
tional income allowed the purchase of essential equipment, including 
transport, needed today to exercise food sovereignty. Activating adjacent 
local and regional supply chains of naturally occurring foods can partly 
offset the high cost of purchased food at the end of long distribution sup -
ply chains.
concluSion : Food and coronaviruS  SuPPly  chainS
Anna Tsing ( 2009 ) has theorized how the processes of supply chain capi -
talism create global standardization while generating growing gaps 
between rich and poor. Here, we have focused on disparities between 
Indigenous Australians and others, those living in the sparsely populated 
remote north and centre and those living in the more densely populated 
south. We show that those living at the very end of global food supply 
chains are subject to imposed technical solutions to the challenges posed 
by remoteness, while at the same time the historical and politico-structural 
circumstances that have created and maintained Indigenous poverty and 
marginalization are overlooked. The promise of economic salvation is 
predicated on paid work that does not exist, alongside an enduring myopia 
about actual livelihood possibilities where people live and can access land 
and its resources.
Emerging future-focused possibilities for self-provisioning are limited 
by government policy and escalating impoverishment. In remote Australia, 
surplus populations are located alongside growing availability of land and 
natural resources. People in such places have limited prospects for paid 
work. The social contract with the state sees income support delivered 
without any compensatory reference to local costs at the end of the global  J. ALTMAN AND F. MARKHAM
135
food supply chain. Indeed, the liberal settler state is highly ambiguous as 
to whether it seeks to make its policies “make live” or “let die” (Li, 2010 ). 
At the discursive and performative level, government policy looks to 
“make live” with cheaper, supposedly healthy store food, but actions to 
“make live” by increasing incomes or enhancing prospects for food sover -
eignty are not countenanced. The growing dependence on the store is 
becoming more and more embedded, while the scope to access legally 
guaranteed natural resources is rendered next to impossible.
We began our chapter with reference to a parliamentary inquiry urgently 
convened during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to examine 
issues of food pricing and food insecurity in remote Indigenous communi -
ties. Unsurprisingly, the inquiry reported that food prices for people living 
at the very end of global food supply chains are high, while poverty means 
that people experienced high levels of food insecurity. The inquiry recom -
mended technical and regulatory actions to reduce prices at stores. 
Paradoxically, perhaps, the long and tenuous supply chains had a positive 
effect in assisting to keep remote Indigenous Australia relatively free of the 
coronavirus to date, with few infections and deaths in the first year of the 
pandemic. But the inquiry also opened a Pandora’s box of questions about 
the many development challenges that remote Indigenous communities 
face daily. Food security cannot come from the store alone because people 
do not earn enough to pay for expensive food. So, we contend, either 
income-support payments need to increase or much more food needs to 
be derived from self-provisioning in the hinterland, beyond the store and 
the reach of the state.

The UN Food Systems Summit: Disaster 
Capitalism and the Future of Food
Tomaso Ferrando
Abstract COVID-19 has brought to light the multiple cracks in the 
logistically integrated, financialized and commodity-based capitalist food 
system. As with other aspects of social life thrown into disruption amid the 
global health, economic and environmental downturn, the early weeks of 
the pandemic seemed to offer the hope of transformative possibility, a 
“portal” towards different food systems. The time seemed ripe for the 
kinds of radical transitions that social movements and peasants’ organiza -
tions have requested for decades: subverting the “conventional” food sys -
tem without going back to “corporate normality”. However, when the 
multiple crises are characterized as exceptional rather than structural, a 
narrative of emergency and urgency is deployed to reinforce the power of 
the incumbents. The overlap between the pandemic and the climate crisis 
can be an opportunity, but hardly for peasants and indigenous people. As 
in Naomi Klein’s Shock Doctrine , corporate actors and billionaire philan -
thropists are using the rhetoric of urgency to push for changes that rein -
force the status quo and do not address the root causes that have brought

with one example of ongoing co-optation of the state of climate and sani -

food policy arena where decisions are distanced from peasants, indigenous 
communities and citizens and put in the hands of corporations, financial 
investors and billionaire philanthropists.

IntroductIon
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact akin to that of a “natural” 
disaster on the global capitalist food system. It has magnified and intensi -
fied the socio-economic cracks that compose its texture, and it has 
devoured people and their relationships (Viner, 2020 ). Since the begin -
ning of 2020 the world has experienced skyrocketing levels of food pov -
erty: in 2020, the number of people going hungry was 15 per cent higher 
than in 2019. Food shortages have been experienced in the Global North 
and the Global South, and the overexposure of underpaid food workers to 
the risk of infection has been widely documented (e.g. see Bogoeski, 
2021 ). Worldwide, farmers and consumers dependent on international 
trade, along with informal and local food traders, have been hit by the 
temporary paralysis of the global logistic infrastructure. Producers have 
suffered as a result of reductions in global demand for particular products, 
the closure of informal and local markets, and the implementation of more 
rigid health and safety restrictions.
At the same time, climate change and the loss of social and biological 
diversity are ravaging the planet. The year 2020 registered the increasing 
probability of record-shattering climate extremes (Fischer et al., 2021 ), 
and it was one of the three warmest years on record, with a global average 
temperature of 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial (1850–1900) lev -
els. There was heavy rain and extensive flooding over large parts of Africa 
and Asia. There were wildfires, droughts and 30 named storms in the 
North Atlantic hurricane season—the largest number of named storms on 
record (World Meteorological Organization, 2020 ). According to the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC, 
2020 ), more than 50 million people were doubly hit in 2020 by  T. FERRANDO
141
climate- related disasters and by the pandemic, a situation that worsened 
food insecurity and added another layer of risk to disaster-related evacua -
tion, recovery and relief operations.
Just a few months into the pandemic, it was clear to many that the 
global food system was incapable of providing adequate daily nutrition for 
the world’s population, let alone delivering a good life for those who par -
ticipate in food production or a promising future for the environment and 
the planet. The intensity and transnational nature of the shocks felt on the 
ground were such that the time seemed ripe for the radical transformation 
that indigenous people, grassroots organizations and peasants’ organiza -
tions have been pursuing for decades. Suddenly, the need to address hun -
ger, food security and the link between food systems, climate change and 
the loss of biological and social diversity were placed prominently on polit -
ical agendas. From individual villages and cities to the United Nations, 
voices were raised in passionate advocacy of the need to rethink the future 
of the food system, the future for workers and the future of the planet. For 
many, the slogan “we shall not go back to normality because normality 
was the problem” that was projected on a building in Santiago de Chile 
during the first weeks of lockdown was equally applicable to the economic 
and food systems.
Might we suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is the straw that broke 
the capitalist food system’s back? Without any presumption of complete -
ness, this chapter explores a recent set of events that reveal ongoing 
attempts by corporate actors, governments, academics and billionaire phi -
lanthropists to co-opt the climate change and health “emergency” in con -
junction with the rhetoric of an “urgent need for change” in food systems. 
While they agree on the need to rapidly transform the food system, their 
goal is to implement paradigms, visions and “solutions” that reinforce the 
inequality and structural misery entrenched in capitalist food systems. This 
is the United Nations Food Systems Summit that took place on  23 
September 2021 and that was anticipated over summer 2021 by the 
Science Days and the pre-summit. The summit represents an attempt by 
the global political and economic elite to highjack the dynamics of global 
food governance. The UN Committee on World Food Security and the 
High Level Panel of Experts reject bottom-up and radical solutions and 
rather promote a “multi-stakeholder” approach to food that deploys tech -
nological and digital innovations. In this approach, critical decisions about 
the future of food are depoliticized, distanced from peasants, indigenous 
communities and citizens and aligned with the interests of the status quo 11 THE UN FOOD SYSTEMS SUMMIT: DISASTER CAPITALISM… 
142
and their modernist and techno-optimist approach to systemic socio- 
environmental challenges.
The political and intellectual “violence” of the summit has not gone 
unnoticed. In the last months, it has been a catalyst for a multiplicity of 
social movements, indigenous groups, food workers, academics and oth -
ers who oppose the domination of food systems by the state and capital 
interests (Van Apeldoorn et al., 2012 ). As the dispute unfolds, this chapter 
unpacks the circumstances under which the counter-movement is unfold -
ing. It argues for the need to focus on the legacy of the summit and its 
promotion of a hegemonic vision that is pushed through the rhetorical 
and procedural mechanisms of disaster capitalism (Polanyi, 1944 ).
MultIple  pandeMIc  dIsruptIons : an opportunIty  
for WhoM?
Since the first months of lockdown in early 2020, a series of high-profile 
writers have offered critical commentaries on the relationship between the 
present and future subversion of people and the planet. While not specifi -
cally addressing the future of food, those commentaries are relevant here. 
In April 2020, for example, Arundhati Roi ( 2020 ) wrote that the pan -
demic offered “us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have 
built for ourselves. Nothing could be worse than a return to normality”. 
For Roy, the virus that “made the mighty kneel” could have opened a 
“portal”, a “gateway between one world and the next”. For Naomi Klein, 
like a great depression or a war, the pandemic and the extension of the 
public financial interventions in the Global North possessed the radical -
izing potential for big and positive changes; however, they would have to 
be fought for (Viner, 2020 ). For Achille Mbembe, on the contrary, the 
intensification of the state of emergency due to the spread of the pandemic 
had strengthened the logic of sacrifice that “has always been at the centre 
of neo-liberalism, which has always worked with the idea that someone is 
worth more than others” (García, 2020 ). Rather than an opportunity for 
emancipation, Mbembe suggests, recent events have seen the normaliza -
tion of the most violent tendencies of contemporary society.
Each of these analyses could be deployed to describe processes unfold -
ing in the context of food systems, in the North as well as the South. 
Globally, peasants, activists and their allies have been engaging in acts of 
solidarity. They have joined hands to provide protection against COVID-19  T. FERRANDO
143
and carried out exchanges among peasants on the production of healthy 
food and “donated food, seed, produced and distributed hygiene and pro -
tective materials” (La Via Campesina, 2020 ) in countries where they are 
based, such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Haiti and Palestine. In sev -
eral cities in the North, people organized food-solidarity activities to fill 
the gaps of the existing “short-term, scattered, top-down and under- 
funded initiatives [that] have been both the cause and the consequence of 
the current food poverty crisis” (Lombardozzi et al., 2021 ). People gath -
ered momentum to promote local strategies of solidarity, often in contra -
position with both market and state. At the same time, however, already in 
August 2020 La Via Campesina reported that governments had detained, 
beaten and harassed volunteers at community-led soup kitchens, imple -
mented strict checkpoints that discouraged peasants from reaching their 
farmlands, collaborated with private actors to forcefully evict villagers, and 
reformed labour, land and other forms of legal protection in order to 
facilitate the flow of foreign investments and a quick economic recovery 
(La Via Campesina, 2020 ; Ferrando & Vecchione Gonçalves, 2020 ).
The struggles that are taking place on the ground are reproduced inter -
nationally and globally. Yet at a distance from the localism of solidarity and 
collaboration, the urgent need to transform food systems has been pro -
gressively co-opted within the dominant capitalist framework and has trig -
gered political processes whose outcomes will run significantly at odds 
with the needs and rights of the billions of smallholders who produce most 
of the world’s food as well as the ecological needs of the web of life (Capra, 
1997 ). This process of co-optation does not unfold evenly or homoge -
nously. Often, co-optation occurs by replacing the political concepts pro -
moted “from below” with “sterile” and technical ideas that sidestep issues 
of power, ecological justice and rights. In other cases, it happens through 
the strategic use of fear and imminence to legitimize policy changes that 
are blind to the socio-environmental complexity of food systems and serve 
to reproduce the capitalist mode of production. Even when narratives 
identify human rights and agroecology, these concepts are treated as 
addenda or “extra” or refigured as ideas about “nature positive food sys -
tems” and “carbon neutrality” that push the future of food away from the 
aspirations of peasants, indigenous communities and citizens and into the 
hands of corporations, financial investors and billionaire philanthropists.
The pandemic has seen the intensification of the global capitalist food 
system, amplifying existing critical social and environmental conditions 
and making more urgent the need for transformative intervention. In the 11 THE UN FOOD SYSTEMS SUMMIT: DISASTER CAPITALISM… 
144
same period multiple bottom-up and grassroots initiatives have been call -
ing out the shortcomings of a system that treats food as a commodity 
rather than a public good, a right and a commons (Vivero Pol et  al., 
2018 ). However, the shocks to the food systems are not only opening new 
possibilities for radical transformation but also creating the rhetorical and 
material conditions for the intensification of processes of marginalization, 
commodification, dispossession and appropriation (Harvey, 2003 ). 
Echoing Naomi Klein’s ( 2007 ) analysis of the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina in New Orleans, instrumental narratives of “urgency” have been 
deployed to frame pandemic disruptions of the food system, consolidating 
the power of political, financial and food elites to the detriment of peas -
ants, indigenous people and non-commodified food systems (Agamben, 
1998 , 2008 ). Global food governance appears to be experiencing an 
intensification of “disaster capitalism” wherein national and transnational 
governmental institutions instrumentalize the catastrophe “to promote 
and empower a range of private, neoliberal capitalist interests” (Schuller & 
Maldonado, 2016 , p. 62). At the international and European level, the 
fight for the future of food has never been so intense.

On 16 October 2019, World Food Day, the United Nations Secretary- 
General, António Guterres, announced to the Plenary of the UN 
Committee on World Food Security that he would organize a high-level 
UN Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of Action to deliver the 
Sustainable Development Goals. The summit had been jointly requested 
by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development, the World Food Programme and the World 
Economic Forum. Originally planned for autumn 2020, the summit was 
postponed to September 2021 as a result of the pandemic (One Planet 
Network, 2019 ). At the time of writing, a few weeks before the summit 
and few weeks after the July pre-summit in Rome, the processes, forms of 
participation, power dynamics and goals of the summit remain unclear and 
contested.
Since Guterres’ announcement, several things have changed in the 
world and in the narrative around the Food Systems Summit. A gathering 
that was originally aimed at creating a world free of hunger by: T. FERRANDO
145
affirming the centrality of food systems to the achievement of the 2030 
Agenda, aligning stakeholders involved in food systems transformation 
around a common practical framework, strengthening evidence and devel -
oping tools for decision makers to make choices on trade-offs, promoting a 
science-policy interface on food systems, and accelerating multi-stakeholder 
actions at different levels. (One Planet Network, 2019 )
is now presented as the last call to deal with the “urgency” of reshaping 
“food systems so they support healthy diets for all and do more to make 
food production and consumption aligned to sustainable development” 
(United Nations, 2020 , p. 2). For the United Nations ( 2020 , p. 4): “This 
crisis can serve as a turning point to rebalance and transform our food 
systems, making them more inclusive, sustainable and resilient”.
Although there is generalized agreement about the need to address the 
social and environmental injustices that stem from and affect the global 
food system, the question is whether the Food Systems Summit is the 
appropriate space and its invitees the right people to recognize that the 
“sickness” of the system is not a peripheral issue but a central issue of their 
own making (Mozo, 2013 ). To paraphrase Susan Marks ( 2011 ), it is 
important to question whether the sense of “urgency” and “emergency” 
will lead to comprehensive reflection on the state of misery entrenched in 
food systems and a commitment to interrogate root causes or whether 
structural incoherence and tensions will be overshadowed by calls for 
more technology, more manipulation of nature and the application of 
bandages to a “capitalist ecosystem” that is chronically ill.
The risk of co-optation of the disruptive effects of COVID-19 and the 
related state of emergency have not gone unnoticed. Since Guterres’ 
announcement, the summit has been challenged by civil society organiza -
tions and indigenous people who are part of the Civil Society and 
Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism for relations with the UN Committee on 
World Food Security. For them and their allies, the summit and its rhetoric 
represent a direct attack on the Committee on World Food Security and 
the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition as legiti -
mate spaces that are accessible to the people who make food possible and 
that reflect the political nature of the global governance of food. Moreover, 
the summit has been presented as an attempt to highjack the “emergency” 
to promote an idea of “multi-stakeholderism” that puts foxes and chickens 
in the same coop (McKeon, 2017 ) and overlooks the structural incompat -
ibilities between different visions of food systems. This rhetoric around 11 THE UN FOOD SYSTEMS SUMMIT: DISASTER CAPITALISM… 
146
the summit nurtures the false impression that “there is space for everyone 
around the table” while implementing an agenda based on a monolithic 
and Eurocentric understanding of progress, science and techno-fixes.
The co-optation is evident in the way the summit has been conceived, 
the boundaries of “expertise” defined and related knowledge produced. 
In mid-2019, a concept note circulated at the High-Level Political Forum 
indicated that the World Economic Forum would be involved in organiz -
ing the summit. Subsequently, the president of the Alliance for a Green 
Revolution in Africa was appointed by Guterres as the special envoy to the 
summit. The fact that the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa is a 
leader in the promotion of a “modernist” and “productivist” conception 
of the future of agriculture, based on genetically enhanced seeds, patents, 
close interaction with corporate actors and digitalization, immediately 
revealed the close connection between the summit and those interests. 
Similarly, corporate-sponsored organizations are present across the five 
“Action Tracks” that have had carriage of brainstorming and defining the 
future of the system. Moreover, a Scientific Group was established under 
the coordination of Professor Joachim Von Braun that organized a two- 
day event in early July 2021 and reinforced “recognition of the pivotal 
role of science, technology and innovation for food systems transforma -
tion” and aimed to “offer an important opportunity to support the agenda 
setting process with scientific evidence and perspectives” (United 
Nations, 2021 ).
These political and power dynamics led more than 400 indigenous, 
peasant and civil society organizations to write to UN Secretary-General 
Guterres in March 2020, challenging the summit as a space that does not 
draw “from the innovative governance experiences that the UN system 
has to offer, [but] is helping to establish stakeholder capitalism as a gover -
nance model for the entire planet” (Letter to H.E. Mr António Guterres, 
2020 ). In their statement, the food activists requested that the partnership 
between the World Economic Forum and the Alliance for a Green 
Revolution in Africa be discontinued if the summit process was not to be 
derailed. In the absence of a satisfactory response, in February 2021, the 
Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism reached out to Guterres 
and announced that it would have not “jumped on a train going in the 
wrong direction” and, in the absence of substantial change in the struc -
ture, governance and purpose of the summit, would not participate.
Facing these criticisms, the Food Systems Summit bunkered down 
behind its own narrative of “inclusiveness” rather than recognize the  T. FERRANDO
147
tensions and incompatibility between visions. In line with the idea of a 
“Great Reset” promoted by Klaus Schwab ( 2021 ), the founder and execu -
tive chairman of the World Economic Forum and special envoy to the 
summit, Dr Agnes Kalibata, responded to the criticisms of co-optation by 
stressing the open nature of the summit and that everyone had a seat at 
the table. She strengthened the call for “multi-stakeholderism” and the 
idea of a “new social contract” as tools to overcome the ongoing impasse. 
According to Kalibata, what was required was the quick implementation 
of solutions that would increase the productivity, availability and sustain -
ability of food systems.
In early March 2021, Kalibata published an article in The Guardian  (on 
a page sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the 
sponsors of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa) where she 
claimed:
The entire purpose of the summit is to embrace not only the shared interests 
of all stakeholders but also—importantly—the areas of divergence on how 
we go about addressing the harsh reality humanity faces. If we are to build 
more inclusive food systems, we must be prepared to have inclusive debate. 
(Kalibata, 2021 )
If everyone can speak, the social contract argument goes, the solution 
will inevitably be the one to benefit everyone—a compromise that takes 
everyone’s perspective into account and leverages common aspirations 
and needs. If everyone puts aside their preconceptions and walks together 
in the same direction, we can reach the goal that everyone desires.
However, critical race approaches to liberalism and egalitarianism 
(Delgado & Stefancic, 1993 , p. 462; Crenshaw, 1989 , 1991 ), critical fem -
inist accounts that read social contracts foregrounding inclusion as repro -
ducing dualism and domination (Pateman, 1988 ), and recent accounts of 
the push towards “multi-stakeholderism” in food systems as an attempt to 
neutralize power dynamics (McKeon, 2017 ) teach us that such power-
neutral visions of society lead to the misrecognition of existing inequali -
ties, the consolidation of incumbent power structures, and the creation of 
new forms of exclusion and subordination. In the specific case of food 
systems, the idea that “coexistence” between capitalist and non- capitalist 
visions of food is possible is equally characterized by misrecognition of the 
expansionist and transformative impact of capitalism as a specific way of 
organizing people and nature. Genetically modified BT aubergines are 11 THE UN FOOD SYSTEMS SUMMIT: DISASTER CAPITALISM… 
148
promoted at the same time as agroecology. Gene editing and the restora -
tion of the commons are discussed in the same context. Corporate power 
and its responsibility for the state of food systems are never discussed (Von 
Braun et al., 2021 ). In the context of radical power imbalances and com -
petition over resources, what power has the subaltern to define the terms 
of this “coexistence”?
The need to address the role of corporations and corporate philanthro -
pists in (not-so-silently) shaping the structure, agenda and future of food 
systems has become even more urgent in the events leading up to the sum -
mit. During the inauguration of the pre-summit, the chair of Imagine was 
invited to speak after heads of state, the European Commission and the 
World Bank. Imagine, the chair said, is an organization that helps busi -
nesses “eradicate poverty and inequality and stem runaway climate change” 
(the organization’s website says Imagine helps “C-suites see their busi -
ness’ true place in the world” (Imagine, 2021 )). He deployed the rhetoric 
that technology for change is available, that transforming food systems has 
the highest return from ecological, social and financial perspectives and 
that with relatively small investments ($300–400 billion) “we” can trans -
form the food system into a positive economic force, doubling agricultural 
productivity with half the inputs currently used.
On the second day, a session on “Private Sector Priorities at the UN 
Food Systems Pre-Summit” included the president of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development and representatives of some of the 
largest food companies in the world (Nestlé, Unilever, PepsiCo). The ses -
sion praised the publication of the Business Declaration for Food Systems 
Transformation as a vision that reinforces the role of corporate capital and 
its centrality in addressing social and environmental problems (as if these 
problems had been created by unknown forces or “natural” events). 
Discussion in this session summoned all the sustainability buzzwords to 
call for the urgent establishment of a food system that was “equitable, net 
zero, nature positive, resilient and capable of feeding all people”. Planetary 
boundaries, soil healthiness, living income for all, regenerative agriculture 
and other key terms that would usually be leveraged in critiques of the 
capitalist food system have now been integrated into corporate speeches. 
Citing “urgency” and “stakeholderism”, they shift attention away from 
questions of who is responsible for the ongoing misery of so many of the 
world’s population (Marks, 2011 ) and stress the transformative role of 
large-scale corporate players. T. FERRANDO
149
For the president of Unilever’s Foods & Refreshment division, for 
example, living income for all producers in their chain is a goal. However, 
corporations cannot achieve this on their own, a statement that clashes 
with Unilever’s US$6.3 billion net income in 2020 and the steady distri -
bution of dividends to shareholders that has been guaranteed in the last 
years. Thus, the future is that of a corporate-led global food system where 
farmers who capture carbon in the soil, “smart agricultural practices to 
achieve net-zero and nature positive food systems”, digital technologies, 
innovations, collaboration among corporations around sustainability to 
maintain the same levels of financial return (Lombardi & Ferrando, 2021 ), 
and the adoption of policies and subsidies that support regenerative and 
nutritious agricultural practices, healthier consumption and reduced food 
loss and waste. Rather than the problem, corporations and their global 
power are presented as the solution. In the words of Nestlé’s CEO: “the 
private sector is the implementation machine”. For PepsiCo’s chairperson: 
corporations have the “unique power of talking to a billion-plus consum -
ers and have to educate them” to buy commodities that are better for the 
planet and the workers (Kuljay et al., 2021 ).
At this time of multiple structural social and ecological crises, the Food 
Systems Summit and its prequels (such as the Sciences Day and the pre- 
summit) represent more than a falsely inclusive process that promotes 
partnerships among unequals (Canfield et  al., 2021 ). They resemble a 
classic capitalist attempt to co-opt and internalize critiques (such as poor 
working conditions, undernourishment and obesity) and terminology 
(like “planetary boundaries” and regenerative agriculture) to promote a 
mix of old and new technological and digital solutions that reinforce the 
idea that humans can control nature and shape societies, distract from the 
political nature of the struggle, overlook questions of who benefits, and 
entrench the reproduction of global capitalism. In this context, members 
of the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism for relations with 
the UN Committee on World Food Security, academics and other civil 
society organizations refuse to legitimize this “new food space” and 
instead are organizing an alternative people’s pre-summit and summit to 
debunk the procedure, narrative and outputs of the Food Systems Summit. 
However, resisting co-optation may not be enough. The new convergence 
of interests of private and public elites could represent an ominous further 
turning point in respect of the future of food and the web of life that 
makes it possible (Capra, 1997 ).11 THE UN FOOD SYSTEMS SUMMIT: DISASTER CAPITALISM…

conclusIon
For billions of people around the world, COVID-19 and the climate 
emergency have shown that the capitalist and financialized food system is 
in a state of permanent emergency, a condition of intrinsic sickness that is 
inherent to its construction (Mozo, 2013 ). From the Global North to the 
Global South, the several months of compound disruptions have multi -
plied the reasons to think that the capitalist and financialized food system 
is not essential to the future of food but rather responsible for the social 
and environmental injustices that characterize its past and present. Who is 
essential to the future of the food systems? It is the billions of peasants and 
workers (mainly migrants) that farm, transform, transport, distribute and 
cook. It is the gift of nature and the regenerative capacity of soil and eco -
systems to reproduce themselves (when they are not depleted). It is the 
predisposition of public policies that treat food as a public good (if not a 
commons), leverage responsibilities for social and environmental harms, 
redress historical inequalities and contribute to the establishment of dem -
ocratic spaces of decision-making and governance.
The mainstream responses to the pandemic have contributed to the 
promotion of a particular rhetoric in relation to the present and future of 
food: the idea that urgency and misery are not structural and planned 
(Marks, 2011 ) but contingent upon and defined by an unfortunate com -
bination of multiple factors that have little to do with capitalism and the 
idea that food is nothing but a commodity (United Nations, 2020 ). In 
this context, not only are the root causes of the problems overlooked but 
also the rhetoric and processes of the state of emergency are deployed to 
reinforce the status quo and promote solutions that do not challenge 
existing structures of power and accumulation. The United Nations Food 
Systems Summit, a “multi-stakeholder” event for digital and technological 
innovation, demonstrates this process in action.
At the same time, the political and economic violence of the summit 
has had a mobilizing effect on social movements, indigenous groups, food 
workers, human rights lawyers and academics and served to strengthen the 
interactions between those who oppose the domination of the food sys -
tems and their future shaping by contemporary configurations of state and 
capital (Van Apeldoorn et al., 2012 ). For them, the Food Systems Summit 
risks being the last nail in the coffin of food sovereignty, food democracy 
and food justice—a way of co-opting the moment of crisis while ignoring 
structural concerns around the circulation of power, inequality and profit.  T. FERRANDO
151
These groups expose the deployment of “urgency” and “emergency” to 
transform those who are responsible for misery into saviours, the use of 
quick fixes in place of long-lasting solutions and the marginalization of 
pivotal concepts such as the right to food and self-determination. As the 
dispute unfolds before our eyes, we need to be attentive and critically 
engaged. Will the summit prove Mbembe right and consolidate the idea 
that someone (financialized capital) is worth more than others? Or will the 
counter-movement (Polanyi, 1944 ) be capable of defying the hegemonic 
vision promoted by the summit and succeed in destabilizing the mecha -
nisms of disaster capitalism? What is clear is that disruptions in the time of 
COVID-19 have intensified processes and dynamics that have been 
unfolding for decades. Whatever radical potential exists will have to be 
fought for.

Against Consumer Ethics
Christopher Mayes and Angie Sassano
Abstract Consumer food ethics has re-emerged over the past 30 years as 
a popular form of activism to address concerns with the dominance of 
corporate interests in the global food system. Proponents of consumer 
ethics contend that informing consumers about injustices in the food sys -
tem via labels or awareness campaigns will lead to collective rejection of 
unethical food corporations and the embrace of ethical products. This 
approach has been criticized on a variety of grounds, including its reliance 
on and eventual co-optation by market mechanisms. In response to these 
criticisms, food activists and scholars have promoted a consumer ethic that 
embraces local and alternative food systems, thereby producing an alterna -
tive consumer ethic purportedly outside of market logics. While these 
alternative practices have much to commend them, we argue that alterna -
tive food systems are invariably oriented towards consumer interests and 
thereby run into similar problems faced by earlier iterations of consumer- 
based ethics. We argue against the persistent focus on consumer ethics as 
means of substantially disrupting food systems, whether global, local or 
alternative.

IntroductIon
The global and industrialized food system has enabled the production and 
distribution of cheaper, longer-lasting and more diverse food items. We 
can enjoy tropical fruits in winter, purchase whole chickens for the same 
price as a cup of coffee and eat fresh bread long after it has been baked. 
Once celebrated as the benevolent results of food science, the ingenuity of 
farmers and sophisticated global logistics, these cheap foods are increas -
ingly dismissed as the tainted fruits of Big Food—the culinary version of 
Big Pharma, Big Tobacco and Big Oil.
Activists and scholars have pointed to unethical practices in global food 
production since at least the sugar boycotts of the eighteenth century. 
Over the past 30 years, food activists and scholars have renewed efforts to 
draw attention to the negative effects of the global food system on the 
environment, farm workers, animal welfare and human health. 
Documentary films and books on the exploits of Big Food have become a 
profitable sub-genre of the entertainment industry and propelled the 
issues and their authors to the spotlight. Books by Michael Pollan, Eric 
Schlosser and Marion Nestle, as well as associated feature films such as Fast 
Food Nation  (2006), Food, Inc.  (2008), Farmageddon  (2011), Fed Up  
(2014) and Seaspiracy  (2021), have popularized concerns about the nega -
tive effects of the global food system. In addition, awareness campaigns 
and labelling schemes attempt to bring the ethical and political realities of 
food to consumer attention at the purchase point. Ethical labelling such as 
“Fair Trade” characterizes food choice as a matter not simply of taste or 
convenience but of ethical and political importance.
Underlying these campaigns, labels and films is the shared belief that 
consumers have been kept ignorant of the truth by multinational food 
corporations and neoliberal governments; if consumers are enlightened, 
they will use their collective purchasing power to transform, or at least 
alter, industry activities. The basic idea is that by knowing what is in our 
food and how it was cultivated, harvested, produced and distributed, we 
will reject unethical food corporations and buy from ethical producers, 
thereby disrupting unjust practices. Belief in the power of truth to awaken 
the slumbering consumer giant was evoked in mid-1990s anti-global capi -
tal movements. In the introduction to her landmark book, No Logo  
(2002 ), Naomi Klein outlines her hypothesis: “as more people discover 
the brand-name secrets of the global logo web, their outrage will fuel the 
next big political movement, a vast wave of opposition squarely targeting  C. MAYES AND A. SASSANO
157
transnational corporations, particularly those with very high name-brand 
recognition” (Klein, 2002 ). According to Klein, when the veil is removed 
and people discover the “secrets” behind their consumer products, an out -
rage—or at least changed consumer behaviours—will be unleashed, trans -
forming the global web of capital. This logic is echoed in calls for food 
labels to reveal the unethical production practices of Big Food (Wells, 2016 ).
There is a diverse literature revealing the limits of ethico-political con -
sumption (Carrington et  al., 2021 ). In this chapter, we briefly explore 
three: the transformation of citizens into consumers; the co-optation of 
consumer ethics by the market; and the dominance of consumer interests 
in determining what is ethically salient. We conclude by examining whether 
calls for alternative food systems can offer a disruption to the global food 
system or whether it is at risk of consumer co-optation.
consumers  not cItIzens
An initial criticism of ethical consumption is that citizens are transformed 
into consumers, reducing political action to consumption (Soper & 
Trentmann, 2008 ). Holding governments and companies accountable for 
unethical practices therefore becomes a matter of consumer choice rather 
than systemic change. Basing ethical and political action in consumer prac -
tices is a problem for at least two reasons. First, this approach is regressive 
in that it places a greater burden on the financially less well off to act ethi -
cally. Second, it is a thin and privatized approach to ethico-political action, 
ultimately serving to absolve one’s individual guilt while allowing injus -
tices to continue.
The claim that this approach is regressive is quite straightforward. As 
Thomas Wells ( 2016 ) outlines in his argument for labels exposing animal 
cruelty, they would allow better but more expensive standards of animal 
welfare. This phenomenon is repeatedly seen in the market, where prod -
ucts purporting to be more ethical, just or environmentally sustainable are 
considerably more expensive than the standard product as they include the 
“real” costs of production. As such, to enact one’s ethical and political 
preferences requires a sufficient income, thereby making ethico-political 
consumption more achievable for the wealthy and less so for those on 
lower incomes. This scenario leaves some individuals feeling incapable of 
enacting their moral and political beliefs due to financial constraints, while 
others feel that they have fully discharged theirs. This criticism has been 12 AGAINST CONSUMER ETHICS 
158
made by several scholars across a variety of disciplines (Carrington et al., 
2021 , p. 227).
The second claim, that consumption is a thin and privatized approach 
to ethical action, is less straightforward. The political thought of Hannah 
Arendt is useful for articulating the distinction between consumer and citi -
zen (Arendt, 1998 ). For Arendt, citizens actively participate in collective 
deliberation about the values of the political community or polis. Citizens 
have duties, obligations and rights and are situated within a public political 
community recognized by political institutions. While citizenship is a 
problematic category in its exclusivity, and we do not wish to imply that 
meaningful political action is only performed within the parameters of citi -
zenship, the consumer, by contrast, has a substantially narrowed set of 
duties, obligations and rights, often defined by private individual prefer -
ences (Arendt, 1977 ). For Arendt, the satisfaction of individual prefer -
ences is secondary to politics, and if it becomes primary, it has a corrosive 
effect on the public sphere and political action. Rather than participating 
in and helping shape a polis, the consumer is in the market seeking to fulfil 
their private interests. Therefore, focusing on the consumer restricts ethi -
cal and political action to the supermarket aisles and home pantry. While 
ethics as a consumer preference may be acceptable in some disputable 
cases—for instance, whether one chooses to eat animal products—in other 
cases, such as those involving slavery or contributing to ecological col -
lapse, the ethical dilemma reaches beyond private consumer preference. 
Choices permitting slavery or practices that jeopardize the ecological 
integrity required for sustaining life rest on prior political questions about 
the nature and character of the political community and the possibility of 
its continuance. Consequently, these choices cannot be left to private con -
sumer choice but require public political deliberation and action (Arendt, 
1998 , p. 7).
consumer  co-optatIon
A second problem with ethico-political consumption is that the consumer 
response is susceptible to co-optation by the very corporations that are 
being protested against. Due to the vast array of products sold by transna -
tional corporations, it is possible for corporations to maintain highly prof -
itable but “unethical” products along with less profitable but “ethical” 
ones. For example, Pace Farm is one of the largest producers of cage eggs  C. MAYES AND A. SASSANO
159
in Australia, yet it sells free-range eggs, too. It also owns other brands, 
such as Family Value, that are not obviously associated with Pace Farm.
The poverty of this situation can be more fully understood through 
Ivan Illich’s concept of “radical monopoly”. A monopoly is generally 
understood as one corporation having control over a market. Illich ( 1973 ) 
uses the example of Coca-Cola’s monopoly over the soft-drink market in 
Nicaragua: if a Nicaraguan wants a cold drink, their only options are Coke 
or water. These sorts of monopolies “restrict the choices open to the con -
sumer” (Illich, 1973 , p. 57). A radical monopoly, however, according to 
Illich, means “the dominance of the one type of product rather than the 
dominance of one brand” (Illich, 1973 , p. 57). To use Illich’s example, in 
large cities such as Los Angeles, cars monopolize traffic and shape urban 
infrastructure such that other forms of transport are eliminated. It is that 
the dominance of the car “curtails the right to walk, not that more people 
drive Chevies than Fords, [that] constitutes radical monopoly” (Illich, 
1973 , p. 57).
In a similar way, large supermarkets exert a radical monopoly over dis -
tribution of and access to food. For example, it is almost impossible for the 
majority of Australians to avoid the supermarket. As such, consumer 
choice, ethical or otherwise, occurs within the context of a for-profit dis -
tribution system that effectively eliminates other possibilities of engaging 
with the harvesting, production and distribution of food. The potency of 
ethico-political consumption—the proverbial “voting with your wallet”—
is captured by the very forces that actors are trying to resist. Even if ethical 
labels and awareness campaigns serve to disrupt corporate brands, they 
also trap individuals into responsibility for systemic and global issues, such 
as public health, global poverty, animal welfare or fair working conditions. 
This is not to say that the consumer is absolved but that the idea that more 
consumption will solve the problems of consumption is self-defeating.
consumer  self-Interest
A third criticism is the way consumer interests dominate and set the terms 
of what is ethically salient. In 1905 Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle  to 
highlight the hazardous working conditions of Chicago’s meatpacking 
industry. His US audience, however, was more horrified by the sanitary 
conditions, which resulted in the Pure Food and Drug Act  1906. This 
improved food sanitation for consumers but neglected the conditions for 
the workers (Kantor, 1976 ), which led Sinclair to quip, “I aimed for the 12 AGAINST CONSUMER ETHICS 
160
public’s heart, and by accident hit it in the stomach”. Likewise today, 
much of the discussion surrounding the ethics of food focuses on con -
sumer practices (Mayes, 2016 ).
It is at this point of tension between consumer and producer that 
Michel Foucault’s work on biopolitics can be useful. Foucault summarized 
the dual objective of biopolitics as to “foster life or disallow it to the point 
of death” (Foucault, 1998 , p. 138). Those whose lives have been disal -
lowed are placed outside of the population that is cared for. Under neolib -
eral approaches to governance, biopolitical strategies increasingly operate 
through the market and consumer choice. Ethical labels and political con -
sumption are an obvious avenue through which the conduct and behav -
iours of individuals are made biopolitically salient. Strategies of labelling 
not only limit ethical and political action to consumption but allow the 
interests of consumers to set the terms and conditions of whose interests 
and what practices are considered ethically or politically problematic.
In a series of articles based on their research on the Californian straw -
berry industry, Julie Guthman and Sandy Brown have noted the biopoliti -
cal question of whose lives and interests matter in debates over the use of 
methyl iodide (Guthman & Brown, 2016a , 2016b , 2016c ). They found 
that much of the debate around the use of this pesticide was framed in 
terms of consumers’ concern for their own health and the health of their 
families. This is despite the fact that the harmful effects of this pesticide 
would not affect consumers but would have serious consequences for farm 
workers. This is a perverse example of “biopolitical sorting” (Guthman & 
Brown, 2016a , p. 579). Not only was this a valuing of consumer interests 
over those of farm workers (many of whom were undocumented and thus 
had little political voice) but, in reality, consumers had no real interest in 
this issue unless they were showing solidarity with farm workers.
alternatIve  consumptIon ?
Consumer activism is partly limited by its reliance on linear and contained 
conceptualizations of food supply chains that obscure the broader com -
plexes of actors and forces in play. In response, food activists and scholars 
have promoted an ethic of embracing local and alternative food systems 
that tries to adopt complex understandings of a food system shaped by a 
multiplicity of actors and power relations. Alternative food practices are an 
increasingly prominent solution to problems associated with the global 
food system, and it is hoped that they can produce an alternative con -
sumer ethic outside market logics. C. MAYES AND A. SASSANO
161
Alternative food systems are diverse; however, we conceptualize them 
as seeking to resist the hegemonic forces of globalized and commercial -
ized food regimes. Different manifestations of alternative food can there -
fore focus on advancing more ecological, more socially just and healthier 
food systems. A specific example of this is community-supported agricul -
ture (CSA), where there is an attempt to disrupt the conventional con -
sumer–producer relationship.
CSAs operate as an alternative to globalized food systems by promoting 
direct producer–consumer interactions. Although there is no single CSA 
model, common to them all is the direct supply of produce from farmers 
to consumers through subscription arrangements. Generally, under these 
arrangements, consumers purchase a financial share in a CSA farm in 
return for a share of the projected harvest over the farm’s season. In line 
with this subscription scheme, CSAs avoid the term “consumer”, prefer -
ring to speak of “members” or “shareholders” and thus evoke a sense of 
producer–consumer solidarity. Therefore, while CSAs are diverse, they 
share the principle of risk-sharing. By opting into a CSA, members com -
mit not only to receiving a share of produce but also to shouldering the 
risks of production. It is through these direct relationships that alternative 
food systems are strengthened and ethico-political consumption is enabled.
Despite the strong sense of solidarity achieved through risk-sharing, 
CSAs are ultimately shaped and limited by consumer interests. The bene -
fits of CSAs for producers are often substantially different to those of con -
sumers. While farmers see the financial benefits of CSAs as consisting in 
the opportunity to escape the volatile industrial food system, in addition 
to their “intangible” benefits of education and community-building, con -
sumers are often driven to CSAs through individual desires in relation to 
taste and quality (Ostrom, 2007 , p. 109). This creates an ethical bridge 
that threatens to destabilize the supposedly “mutual benefit” model of 
CSAs (Wilkes, 2019 ). The asymmetry in benefits and motivations leads to 
a troubled solidarity wherein consumer benefits override producer bene -
fits and often results in exacerbating the challenges faced by farmers in 
maintaining CSA operations. The consumer self-interest is therefore repli -
cated in alternative systems.
Research shows that the social compact forged between consumer and 
producer under a CSA model is often broken by the consumer. CSA 
research in North American and Australian contexts demonstrates signifi -
cant issues with member attrition. CSA success is often dependent on the 
ability of a farmer to attract and maintain members. However, for many, a 12 AGAINST CONSUMER ETHICS 
162
common challenge—and reason for CSA closures—is the inability to 
maintain long-term member commitment (Brown & Miller, 2008 ). 
Ostrom ( 2007 , p. 110) characterizes this as “supermarket withdrawal”, 
suggesting that individuals withdraw from CSAs due to a dislike of the 
type and quantity of produce delivered. This further underscores the radi -
cal monopoly of the supermarket and demonstrates the very fickle reality 
of consumer solidarity, whereby individual desires override the broader 
collective goals of CSA practice.
This leads us to question the extent to which alternative consumption 
such as CSAs are in effect models of “mutual benefit”. Through CSAs, we 
see the repetition of risks to alternative food systems by overplaying the 
role of consumer ethics. Member attrition of CSAs proves that consumers 
can remain passive actors rather than active citizens engaged in ethico- 
political duties. With consumers prioritizing CSAs for individual benefits 
of taste, the consumer politics of CSAs place producers in the same posi -
tion as conventional farmers, whose labour is “chronically undervalued” 
(Ostrom, 2007 , p. 107). Thus, even in contexts where the power of the 
consumer is purportedly deflated, as is the goal of CSA schemes of mutu -
ality, consumer-driven food politics perverts political action by wittingly or 
unwittingly overstating consumer interests at the centre of food politics.
While alternative practices have much to commend them, we contend 
they are open to similar criticisms outlined above. This is not to suggest 
that alternative food systems and practices are equivalent to the global 
capitalist system. Alternative food systems are important for reasons 
beyond the consumer. However, we need an approach to food ethics and 
politics that resists the persistent focus on consumer ethics as means of 
substantially disrupting food systems, whether global, local or alternative.
conclusIon
The COVID pandemic, floods and droughts associated with a changing 
climate and famines remind us that the frequency of food-related crises is 
likely to increase. The capacity to act and reshape our food systems is inte -
gral in our response. Our capacity to rethink food systems is unknown; 
however, we suggest that it will certainly take more than consumer pur -
chasing power. The limits of ethico-political consumption outlined in this 
chapter demonstrate the need to decentre the consumer as an agent of 
change. There is little to suggest that framing ethico-political acts as a 
matter of consumer choice is the solution to holding food corporations  C. MAYES AND A. SASSANO
163
and governments to account for their unethical practices. Instead, it 
becomes clear that such strategies are at risk of considerable co-optation, 
individualizing ethical action and overstating consumer interests.
Calls for alternative systems are similarly at risk of entanglements with 
ethico-political consumption. Perhaps alternative food systems provide a 
vision to disrupt global, industrial food systems. Alternative models of 
mutuality and community-building, as exemplified in CSAs, can actively 
disrupt the volatility and passivity of globalized food systems. However, if 
the consumer continues to be the central agent of change, all alternative 
models risk falling prey to the same troubles of conventional food ethics. 
Through producer–consumer relations in CSAs, the illusion of ethico- 
political consumption is unveiled; that individual choice is enough to lead 
to systemic disruption and solidarities beyond consumer concern.
There is a desperate need to move beyond a consumer ethics that rele -
gates political action to the supermarket aisles. More research is needed to 
begin conceptualizing alternative food ethics for future food systems. For 
now, the current solution of ethico-political consumption falls far short of 
embracing a necessary and transformative ethic.

Afterword: Temporary Measures
Alex Blanchette
Abstract The disruptions that wracked food supply chains amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic were not exceptional circumstances so much as they 
were events that intensified and clarified the routine norms of a capitalist 
system of sustenance that operates in a state of permanent emergency. The 
capitalist food system is one that develops through temporary measures—
acts that seek to patch structural weaknesses before they explode in ways 
that could destabilize the system itself. Looking via the lens of US animal 
agriculture, this concluding chapter asks if viewing the food system in this 
way might open up alternative ways of thinking about political agency in 
times of mundane crisis, highlighting the messy contingencies of capital -
ism’s own persistent efforts to foreclose the realizations of other, fuller 
visions of nourishment.

The preceding chapters depict a world of food commodities beset by ubiq -
uitous disruption, even as the fundamental conditions of an ever- colonizing 
capitalism change little over time. Moments of rupture and friction that 
would appear to unsettle capitalist hegemony paradoxically entrench it 
even deeper (Giles). Declarations of looming emergency become develop -
ment tools to ensure food chains attract and accumulate yet more capital 
(Sippel). Constant disruptions to ecology and livelihood discipline agricul -
turalists to resigned acquiescence (Rickards and Hinkson). Invocations of 
crisis seek further investment in the status quo (Masco, 2017 ). As Victoria 
Stead and Kirstie Petrou demonstrate, elemental honorary titles like 
“essential” fall flat when they are emplaced onto the farmers, farm workers 
and food supply chain workers who sustain our lives. Rather than a stable 
essence to be protected, maintained and nurtured over time, the authors 
of this volume collectively paint a food system marked by what Melinda 
Cooper ( 2008 , p. 20) has called a capitalist delirium restlessly defined by 
the cyclical “breakdown and recreation of whole worlds”. As Tomaso 
Ferrando and others argue, the disruptions that wracked food supply 
chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic were not exceptional circumstances 
so much as they were events that intensified and clarified the routine 
norms of a capitalist system of sustenance that operates in a state of perma -
nent emergency.
Inspired by these chapters, my concluding suggestion is to consider the 
capitalist food system as one that develops through temporary measures 
(see Stead and Petrou)—and that perhaps agri-capitalism is itself best seen 
as a massive temporary measure. A temporary measure is an act that seeks 
to patch a structural weakness before it explodes in a way that could desta -
bilize the system itself; temporary measures are, more simply, makeshift 
solutions to a problem. The sweeping and much-publicized shifts to trade 
and labour policy that tried to salve scarcity, wastage and livelihood ruin -
ation during the COVID-19 pandemic appear, in this light, as something 
of a ruse. As Henry and Morris illuminate, these rapid shifts in governance 
were not merely a reflection of exceptional circumstances. The manage -
ment of any supply chain, they suggest, is one of unending adjustment as 
issues large and small erupt to the surface; even in “normal” times, the 
labour of supply chains is not characterized by frictionless execution but 
instead by constant patching. The spectacular quality of COVID-19 policy 
adjustments merely made governance through temporary measures more 
visible. What I find useful about focusing onto temporary measures is that 
it might open up alternative ways of thinking about political agency in  A. BLANCHETTE
167
times of mundane crisis. Seeing the food system as a patchwork of tempo -
rary measures helps us not only sense the contingent messiness of these 
processes but also allows us to question the idea that capitalist sustenance 
is directed by omniscient, rational agents. Appearing less like all-powerful 
planners, corporate financiers and international policymakers emerge in 
these chapters as fundamentally reactive: desperately trying to keep afloat 
capitalist food worlds.
I approach this volume, and its analyses of the non-transformational 
upheavals of COVID-19, through my own experiences working in US 
animal agribusinesses. A decade prior to this pandemic, I spent eight 
months shadowing managers across their activities in one of the world’s 
largest pork corporations—a network that annually births, raises and kills 
some 7,000,000 hogs for global distribution. These managers’ days con -
sisted of tamping down endemic crises—their every moment of work was 
directed towards mending problems that stemmed from their own ambi -
tions to confine millions of immunocompromised and genetically homog -
enous animals in a patch of land. Even at the corporation’s upper echelons, 
time was not primarily spent plotting future models and visions of increased 
capital accumulation. It was directed towards devising temporary mea -
sures to keep this biological experiment afloat (see Blanchette, 2020 ). At 
a moment when agri-food corporations project themselves as smoothly 
occupying and stitching together the entire planet, it is time to take more 
seriously the fragility and even the pathetic nature of how food firms main -
tain a hold on life (Lien, 2015 ; Blanchette, 2018 ).
At the same time, and as these chapters suggest, there is a certain recur -
sive power that comes with governing through temporary measures. The 
five largest North American capitalist meat-production firms alone sick -
ened 59,000 of their employees with COVID-19—and they have killed no 
fewer than 269 people since March 2020 (Hassan, 2021 ). By invoking the 
Defense Production Act —itself a temporary measure—in April 2020 to 
legally insulate these companies from prosecution, then-president Donald 
Trump declared these (largely migrant) workers sacrifices to national infra -
structure. The perversity of this temporary measure, this most astonishing 
and latest temporary measure, is that it effectively excused all of the harm -
ful temporary measures that preceded this state-sanctioned licence to kill. 
Consider that prior to the emergence of COVID-19, US animal agribusi -
ness was a patchwork of slaughterhouse-line speed-limit exceptions, spe -
cial rules put in place to accommodate growing animal herd sizes and that 
allowed select companies to strain human bodies to the point where 13 AFTERWORD: TEMPORARY MEASURES 
168
debilitating repetitive-motion injuries were routine. As US confined ani -
mal feeding operations have grown in scale and concentration since the 
1980s, they have been permitted to operate through special laws that 
exempt them from regulation under “normal” industrial rules governing 
air pollution and emissions standards (see Blanchette, 2019 ). Even animal 
breeding farms, with their erotic methods of artificial insemination that 
help increase productivity, had to pursue unique agricultural legal excep -
tions from state legislatures to keep them from running afoul of bestiality 
laws (Rosenberg, 2017 ). North American meat production has long 
developed by exceeding moral and legal norms and then pursuing tempo -
rary measures that enable it to continue unaltered. But the temporary 
measures put into place during COVID-19 make all these prior acts seem 
innocuous compared to the current fact that people were killed for corpo -
rate profits (see also Dickinson).
From where I write and live, in the United States, this history of agri -
cultural capitalism has been a matter of ever-compounding brutalities that 
(for some) make the foundational horrors of that country, with its white -
washed settler-colonial family farms, seem like an object of nostalgic long -
ing. Yet this is where I read the chapters of this volume as making a 
profound intervention. A sub-thread of these chapters is that the status 
quo of settler-productivist agriculture is itself the problem (see Donati, 
Altman and Markham). What sets this volume’s chapters apart is not sim -
ply their timely depictions of the even-further-destabilized capitalist food 
system on which so many depend. It is their refusal to play into the struc -
tural logic of temporary measures, insisting that agri-capitalism’s funda -
mental drive is its own continued reproduction through the suppression of 
indigenous and other lifeways and relations to land that promise the real -
ization of other worlds. On this score, they remind me of a political phi -
losophy articulated by the socialist-feminist theorist Silvia Federici ( 1998 ). 
Federici calls the rise of liberal capitalism—and its restless spread across 
natural and moral borders—a counter-revolution . She insists that the emer -
gence of capitalism was not a historical break from European feudalism—
not a new chapter in a linear progressive march forward in historical 
time—but instead a reactionary  means of subduing ordinary peoples’ 
yearnings for new forms of equality and experimental sociality that threat -
ened to unmake feudalism’s racial-patriarchal mooring (see also Robinson, 
2021 ). What these chapters insist, not unlike Federici, is that capitalism is 
itself better seen as a massive temporary measure whose delirious disrup -
tions continually block and misdirect the pursuit of fuller visions of  A. BLANCHETTE
169
nourishment throughout the food system. In so doing, they prod us to 
nurture ways of living and acting with the realization, as Di Haggerty 
declares in Kelly Donati’s chapter, with respect to the idea that settler pri -
vate property and productivism is soon to be eclipsed, that “We’re only 
here temporarily”.
