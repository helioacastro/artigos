Innovation ABSTRACT  
We examine how extended-release buprenorphine depot (BUP-XR) is put to use and made to work in imple -
mentation practices, attending to how care practices are challenged and adapted as a long-acting technology is 
introduced into service in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in Australia. Our approach is informed by ideas in 
science and technology studies (STS) emphasising the irreducible entanglement of care practices and technology, 
and in particular the concept of ‘tinkering ’ as a practice of adaptation. To make our analysis, we draw on 
qualitative interview accounts (n 19) of service providers involved in BUP-XR implementation across five sites. 
Our analysis considers the disruptive novelty of BUP-XR. Tinkering to make a novel technology work in practice 
slows down the expectation of implementation in relation to transformative innovation, despite the promise of 
dramatic or rapid change. Tinkering allowed for more open relations, for new care practices that departed from 
the routine and familiar, opening potential for how BUP-XR could be put to use and made to work in its new 
situation, and as its situation evolved along-with its implementation. Flexibility and openness of altering re-
lations was, however, at times, held in tension with inflexibility and closure. This analysis identifies a concern for 
what is made present and what is made absent in the altered care network affected by BUP-XR, with the multiple 
effects of supervised daily dosing practices thrown into relief as they become absented. Tinkering to implement 
BUP-XR locally connects with a broader assemblage of trial and movement in the constitution of treatment. The 
introduction of long-acting technologies prompts new questions about embedded implementation practices, 
including supervised dosing, urinalysis, the time and place of psychosocial support, and how other social aspects 
of care might be recalibrated in drug treatment.   
… the task is that of attuning everything to everything else, one way or 
another. What to fiddle with and what to keep fixed, is rarely obvious. 
What you try to do, may not work out. Try something else. Keep on 
tinkering. Doctoring. Caring. It would be great if things were so simple that 
a wise choice made at a single, crucial moment were all that was needed to 
control a body suffering from a disease. It would be great if the world 
fitted into little vignettes. But as it happens, there are always contingencies 
and surprises. 
– Annemarie Mol, The Lancet (2009 , p.1757). Introduction 
Extended-release buprenorphine depot (BUP-XR) is a potentially 
disruptive technology, described as ‘game-changing ’ (Lagios, 2021 ) and 
a ‘watershed event ’ (Ling et al., 2019 ) in the treatment of opioid 
dependence. Administered subcutaneously by a healthcare provider 
either weekly or monthly, BUP-XR provides sustained release of 
buprenorphine over the dosing interval, thus mitigating the costly re-
quirements of daily dosing and the inconvenience of frequent service 
attendance (Haight et al., 2019 ; Larance et al., 2020 ; Lintzeris et al.,

22021 ; Nosyk et al., 2023 ; Sigmon & Bigelow, 2017 ). Emerging clinical 
literature indicates that BUP-XR is associated with high retention in 
opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and may have additional benefits 
compared to sublingual buprenorphine (Dunlop et al., 2022 ; Farrell 
et al., 2022 ; Frost et al., 2019 ; Haight et al., 2019 ; Ling et al., 2010 ; 
Lintzeris et al., 2021 ; Lofwall et al., 2018 ; Martin et al., 2022 ; Rosenthal 
et al., 2016 ). Given the emphasis on supervised dosing frameworks in 
some countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, 
where daily supervised dosing of methadone and sublingual buprenor -
phine is required in a clinic or pharmacy especially in the first months of 
treatment (Kleinman et al., 2022 ), it is hoped that the implementation of 
a long-acting technology might provide additional choice and help 
reshape how OAT can be delivered, in effect, relocating when and how 
care in drug treatment is done. The different temporal and social re-
lations produced by the innovation of long-acting technologies are 
arguably altering the OAT landscape, opening up new possibilities for 
trial and movement in the constitution of treatment. BUP-XR is in the 
process of becoming-with social and clinical worlds, with the localised 
work of implementation an element of these more global shifts. 
BUP-XR undoubtedly has implications for the future of OAT, its 
configuration and delivery, but precisely how BUP-XR might come to be 
integrated into services is still “yet to be known ” (Ling et al., 2019 , p.76). 
Attending to how ‘real world ’ implementation practices can shape up-
take, discontinuation, retention, and other treatment outcomes beyond 
that demonstrated in controlled clinical trials is essential (Iacono et al., 
2024 ; Morgan & Assoumou, 2023 ; Morgan et al., 2021 ). Studies exam -
ining clients ’ experiences of BUP-XR offer some indications of how new 
formulations can work to alter relations of OAT service delivery, for 
example by generating a sense of freedom from restrictive and costly 
treatment regimens (Barnett et al., 2021 ; Matheson et al., 2022 ; Neale 
et al., 2023 ), reconfiguring clients ’ relationship with treatment by of-
fering release from short-term cycles of living (Lancaster et al., 2023 ), 
and altering stigmatising relations (Treloar et al., 2022 ). These studies 
also gesture towards the complex adaptations required to implement an 
OAT medication that acts as a bridge to care without necessarily being 
the focal point, given the potential to disrupt other aspects of treatment 
delivery sometimes relied on for daily contact and social support (Bar-
nett et al., 2021 ; Johnson et al., 2022 ; Lancaster et al., 2023 ; Matheson 
et al., 2022 ). It has been observed that the “relative absence of medi -
cation in daily routines makes present other vital aspects of treatment ”, 
relocating how treatment is made to work “not only in the routines and 
felt effects of medication ” (Lancaster et al., 2023 , p.10). 
Closely attending to how implementation practices are adapted as 
BUP-XR is rolled-out is important but remains underexplored. In medi -
cal research there is increasing attention to practices of implementation, 
with quality improvement methods such as “plan –do–study –act” cycles 
proposed to help support iterative development (Reed & Card, 2016 ; 
Taylor et al., 2014 ), as well as other approaches within implementation 
science orienting towards treating intervention implementations as ef-
fects of social practices in complex systems (Byrne, 2013 ; Callaghan, 
2008 , 2013 ; May et al., 2016 ). These practice-oriented approaches 
emphasise that intervention implementation is not a simple one-off 
thing, but rather made up of many adaptive parts. Although these ap-
proaches seek to understand the messy, less predictable, outcomes of 
implementation by recognising intervention implementations as com-
plex and adaptive, they nonetheless “fall short of appreciating the role 
that material practices play in constituting evidence and intervention as 
emergent fluid objects ” (Rhodes & Lancaster, 2019 , p.2). Shifting 
attention towards intervention implementation as a matter of relational 
materiality allows for seeing in new ways how interventions are 
on-the-move, with implementation networks and events becoming sites 
of investigation to attend to how interventions are transformed and 
made in practices (Rhodes & Lancaster, 2019 ). The complexities and 
contingencies of implementation practices and the material configura -
tions of services can profoundly affect how care is constituted in drug 
treatment and an intervention ’s recovery potential (Fraser, 2006 ; Fraser & valentine, 2008 ; Gomart, 2002 ; Rhodes, 2018 ; Theodoropoulou, 
2023 ). 
Technologies like BUP-XR do not work alone, nor are their potentials 
‘given ’; the effects that interventions make are shaped by how they are 
put to use and made to work in situated practices (Rhodes & Lancaster, 
2019 ). Here, we emphasise an approach that expands notions of agency 
beyond those of human actors to also include nonhuman actors, thus 
opening out the category of the actor to include, for example, “tools, 
plans, logics and processes ” (Andrews & Duff, 2019 , p.129). Implicated 
in the introduction of long-acting formulations are a range of material 
practices and arrangements, for example: matters of storage and logis-
tics; space to accommodate new models of care; staff allocation and 
clinic structure; how these new treatments might be provided alongside 
the continued provision of other oral and sublingual OAT in the one 
service (and across different practice settings); appointment booking 
and management for initial and subsequent visits; technical and 
practice-based considerations surrounding injections and who can pre-
scribe and administer the dose; managing clients ’ information needs as 
well as changing goals and preferences; the changing role of supervision 
in light of new dosing regimens; and how clients, clinicians, and others 
in decision-making positions about treatment imagine who may benefit 
from this particular formulation (Chappuy et al., 2020 ; Farrell et al., 
2022 ; Lancaster et al., 2023 ; Larance et al., 2020 ; Neale et al., 2023 , 
2019 ; Vorspan et al., 2019 ). Although new long-acting formulations 
seem “poised ” to provide OAT in new ways, hopefully increasing con-
venience and ameliorating burdens for both clients and providers alike, 
the clinical literature speculates as to what role practices such as addi-
tional psychosocial services, urinalysis, and medical monitoring might 
continue to play, reflecting enduring concerns about diversion, safety 
and adherence in OAT delivery (Sigmon & Bigelow, 2017 , p.386). Here 
we can begin to see how the introduction of new technologies bring 
about relational effects in a network of care, throwing into relief (and 
bringing into question) how other elements in the network are affected 
and might be re-assembled. Altering practices in an evolving situation, 
in light of new technologies, has rippling flow-on effects, creating dif-
ferences that need to be navigated, including in the face of tensions and 
uncertainties that emerge. Thus, as practices of OAT delivery are 
adapted in light of the introduction of new long-acting formulations, a 
key question is “what to fiddle with and what to keep fixed ” (Mol, 2009 , 
p.1757) in order to maximise benefit. 
In this article we examine how BUP-XR is put to use and made to 
work in everyday implementation practices, specifically attending to 
how care practices are challenged and adapted in relation to the intro-
duction of a new long-acting treatment technology in OAT services in 
Australia. We draw on ideas in science and technology studies (STS) 
which emphasise the irreducible entanglement of care practices and 
technology, and in particular the concept of ‘tinkering ’ as a practice of 
adaptation (Mol, 2009 ; Mol et al., 2010 ). Tinkering centres the relation 
between care and materiality, with care understood here as material 
practice, interwoven into the everyday (Lind˘en & Lydahl, 2021 ). As Mol, 
Moser and Pols argue, technologies “do not work or fail in and of 
themselves. Rather, they depend on care work. On people willing to 
adapt their tools to a specific situation while adapting the situation to 
the tools, on and on, endlessly tinkering ” (2010, pp.14 –15, emphasis 
added). These are not reasoned choices of decision-making as such, but 
adaptations that are worked out in practices, responsively working out 
the changing character of technologies according to their situation, 
along with other elements of daily care practices (Mol, 2009 ). Care, 
understood in this way, thus involves “not simply particular kinds of 
subjectivities, but also instruments, and technologies together with 
other material elements, texts and inscriptions ” (Law, 2010 , pp.66 –67). 
Through this lens, we seek to attend to how BUP-XR is adapted in 
everyday practices, responsive to an evolving situation, noticing its 
continual re-negotiation. 
In examining the implementation of a new long-acting treatment 
technology in this way, our approach also emphasises innovation as one K. Lancaster et al.

3part of a wider set of social and material relations. This approach 
questions the presumption of “a one-way flow of innovation from source 
to consumer (or user) ” and instead accentuates a “continuous process of 
transformation, re-use and re-configuration ” (Irwin, 2023 , p.45). This 
approach directs attention not only to the ‘thing-in-itself ’ (here, a novel 
medication formulation) but also to the practices and relations within 
which it is given shape and meaning (including “expressions of crea-
tivity, care, concern, hope and resourcefulness ”: Irwin, 2023 , pp.45,51). 
Innovation is a distributed effect, and depends on a variety of actors 
(Sørensen, 2007 ; Webster & Wyatt, 2020 ). Thus, not only do technolo -
gies like BUP-XR not work alone, we might also posit that the particular 
innovation of BUP-XR can only be made sense of in context, including in 
relation to “healthcare systems, patterns of inequality and trust, global 
relations and industry-government entanglements ” (Irwin, 2023 , p.47), 
as well as its localised situations of use and the continuous adaptations 
and interventions that characterise the field of drug treatment. 
We take care and technology together, thus complicating the 
promissory discourse within the field of drug treatment which has, at 
times, positioned the potential of new long-acting technologies at a 
distance from the specificities, ambivalences, complexities, and contin -
gencies of how care is done in specific (and often resource-constrained 
and highly stigmatised) sites of practice. Through this analysis, we 
seek to notice and learn from practices that emerge along with oppor -
tunities, challenges, and constraints as BUP-XR is introduced into service 
in an effort to help “tinker towards good care” (Mol, 2010 , p.230). In 
doing so, we aim to cast both innovation and ‘good care’ as situated 
concerns for drug treatment; practices of “persistent tinkering in a world 
full of complex ambivalence and shifting tensions ” (Mol et al., 2010 , 
p.14). 
Method 
The Community Long-Acting Buprenorphine (CoLAB) study was a 
12-month prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of 
monthly BUP-XR. The parent study evaluated clinical outcomes among 
people with opioid dependence receiving BUP-XR and implementation 
practices across a range of healthcare settings in Australia. This trial 
used a subcutaneously injected, extended-release monthly buprenor -
phine formulation (Sublocade ®). The dosing schedule involved two 
doses of 300 mg BUP-XR at baseline and month 1. Thereafter doses were 
flexible with 100 mg or 300 mg every 28 days ( 2/14 days) (see 
Larance et al., 2020 ). Sublocade requires suitable secure storage, either 
under refrigerated conditions (where at the time of the study it was 
expected to be stable for 24 months when stored at 2–8 •C) or at room 
temperature (where at the time of the study it was considered stable for 
a maximum of seven days at 15–30 •C; it has subsequently been shown 
to be stable at these conditions for 28 days). None of the sites had 
experience of the use of Sublocade prior to trial commencement and for 
some sites this was the first experience of delivering any long-acting 
buprenorphine formulation. The study received ethical approval from 
St Vincent ’s Hospital Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee 
(HREC/18/SVH/221) and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT03809143) (see Farrell et al., 2022 ; Shahbazi et al., 2023 ). 
Here, we draw on qualitative data generated alongside the parent 
study to explore practices involved in the implementation and delivery 
of BUP-XR for the treatment of opioid dependence in community-based 
general practice and specialist treatment settings. This qualitative study 
focused on how BUP-XR was put to use and made to work (Rhodes & 
Lancaster, 2019 ) in different sites and situations; how the introduction 
of long-acting treatment formulations reshaped treatment and service 
provision; and the possibilities of, and challenges posed by, BUP-XR. 
In-depth interviews with service providers involved in BUP-XR imple -
mentation practices were undertaken by SG between April 2020 and 
March 2021, facilitated by a topic guide. Most interviews were con-
ducted by phone, due to Covid-19 restrictions, with a minority in-person 
during site visits. Overall, nineteen service providers and clinicians involved in the CoLAB study were interviewed, across five sites in 
Australia (three sites in New South Wales and two in Victoria; one pri-
vate general practice, one community clinic, and three specialist drug 
treatment clinics, and in regional and metropolitan settings). The 
characteristics of the five sites are described in Table 1. At four sites 
(regional NSW, remote NSW, metropolitan Sydney NSW, metropolitan 
Melbourne Victoria), BUP-XR was predominantly administered by a 
nurse or nurse practitioner, and at one site (outer suburbs Melbourne 
Victoria) a combination of nursing and medical staff administered the 
treatment depending on staff availability and rostering. All participants 
interviewed were closely involved in one or more aspects of imple -
mentation, prescription and review, administration, management 
(ordering and storage) of BUP-XR, or aspects of the trial, at one or more 
of the sites. Participants represented a range of professional back-
grounds and roles: seven addiction medicine specialists and researchers 
(including trial investigators, OAT prescribers, psychiatrists, and gen-
eral practitioners); nine nursing staff; two pharmacists; one receptionist 
with a client-facing role. Most participants had long-standing experience 
of OAT delivery, research, or administration. Three respondents had 
fewer than two years of experience in OAT service delivery or research. 
To protect as far as possible against deductive disclosure, the CoLAB 
study sites and the roles and demographics of participants interviewed 
have been deidentified, with pseudonyms used, and specific references 
to names, locations, or local services removed. 
All interviews were audio recorded with consent, transcribed 
verbatim, deidentified, and organised for analysis with NVivo12. The 
corpus of participants ’ accounts was mapped following a process of 
initial and focused coding (Charmaz, 2006 ). A reflexive and interpre -
tative approach to coding and analysis was used, developing, reviewing, 
and refining thematic categories identified in the interview data. In 
keeping with our conceptual framework and informed by emerging 
literature on BUP-XR promise and implementation practices, analysis 
focused on tinkering as a practice of adaptation in service models, sys-
tems, procedures, and care work that occurred along with the intro-
duction of a new technology. Following STS scholar John Law’s (2010) 
contribution to Mol, Moser and Pols’ volume, in which he extends the 
concept of ‘tinkering ’ to examine the multiplicity of care in practice as 
what he calls a ‘choreography of care’, we asked three questions to guide 
our analysis of BUP-XR ’s implementation: “How does it work? How is it 
managed? And when and how does it break down? ” Underpinned by a 
relational ontology, these questions attuned attention to the manner in 
which things transform, evolve and open up in the process of assem -
blage, not conceiving of BUP-XR or its implementation contexts as fixed 
in shape, but constituted in part as they entangle together (Law, 2004 ). 
Centring our attention on the relation between care and materiality, we 
focused on BUP-XR ’s implementation within ‘the clinic ’ (‘the clinic ’ also 
here conceived as in-the-making; a process of assembling in which its 
constituent elements come together). Through our analysis, we attended 
to the temporal and spatial arrangements of treatment service delivery, 
and the coming together of actors and events, examining how the 
introduction of long-acting formulations altered and transformed re-
lations and routines of the clinic. Our analysis sought to notice adap-
tations in implementation practices as matters of ontological movement 
(Dennis et al., 2020 ), that is, as shaping what it is that treatment can do 
and become in its situation (Fomiatti et al., 2017 ; Fraser & valentine, 
2008 ; Gomart, 2002 ; Rhodes, 2018 ; Rhodes et al., 2019 , 2023 ; Savic 
et al., 2018 ). We present our analysis in three sections. First, we consider 
the disruptive novelty of BUP-XR, before then looking at how BUP-XR 
was tinkered with in relation to time and space. Third, we examine 
how the flexibility and openness of altering relations was, at times, held 
in tension with inflexibility and closure. K. Lancaster et al.

5Analysis 
Tinkering with novelty 
Participants reflected on the introduction of BUP-XR as “a total game 
changer” (Robert) and an “amazing big leap” (Catherine). In contrast 
with other areas of medicine, where new pharmaceutical treatments 
were perceived to more frequently become available, the novelty of 
BUP-XR was sensed as a significant disruption to the OAT landscape in 
which “there is not much medications development” (Thomas). BUP-XR 
was spoken about as something different for OAT service delivery, 
which required new learning and altered ways of working in the 
everyday: 
We have not had any new treatments for opioid use disorder for 
many years and so we have got very comfortable using methadone 
and sublingual buprenorphine and so suddenly… […] The injecting 
mechanism was different, and the storage is a bit different, and there 
are a whole lot of things that are different. It was a whole lot of 
learning. How do we order them, how do we store them, how do we 
count them, how do we actually educate our patients? (Robert) 
Robert, a senior clinician with decades of OAT service delivery and 
management experience, reflected on the novelty of BUP-XR and the 
alterations in practice needed to make it work, comparing this with his 
earlier experiences of first implementing sublingual buprenorphine after 
methadone. It was important not to assume that existing systems and 
practices would simply translate and fit with a new technology; things 
needed to be done differently: 
I remember when [sublingual] buprenorphine came in and a lot of 
our systems on how to do a buprenorphine treatment was based on 
methadone, and it took about 5 to 10 years to realise they were quite 
different, and things needed to be done differently. I see a parallel 
with the introduction of the buprenorphine long-acting products, 
that we almost assumed it just going to be like buprenorphine, same 
drug, but actually, you know, there [are] so many other differences. 
(Robert) 
Tinkering to make a novel technology work in practice slows down 
the expectation of implementation in relation to transformative inno-
vation, despite the promise of dramatic or rapid change. Attending to the 
assemblage of the clinic through participants’ accounts, we saw how 
networks of care needed to be afforded time, space, and flexibility, to 
adapt. There was a sense that the introduction of BUP-XR into services 
required refitting, rearranging, and reshaping routine practices, in small 
and big ways, which initially produced some hesitation and anxiety. 
There was concern about “extra duties, extra jobs with the new product 
coming onto the market” (Catherine) and “significant workflow 
changes” for some OAT service staff, depending on how their usual role 
was situated within the evolving system: “it was a change process and 
there was a fair bit of anxiety about it […] internally around workflow 
and safety” (Oscar). 
The change surrounding BUP-XR’s introduction was not experienced 
as a one-off moment in services, but as an unfolding and iterative pro-
cess. Collectively adapting practices in response to novelty was not 
necessarily easy, despite the technology’s reported promise and 
potential: 
Anything new is challenging, changing something is challenging, 
learning something new is challenging at a service level to get 
multiple people to accept change and do something differently. Cli-
nicians probably get too stuck in their ways, not want to do anything 
new, they learnt what they learnt 20 years ago, whatever they learnt, 
they don’t want to change, they don’t want to do anything different, 
that’s the barrier. (Thomas) 
Within the clinic assemblage it took time to become familiar with the 
new relations BUP-XR produced. This novel technology required ‘working out’, experimenting to make care work. Administering in-
jections is one element of implementation through which practices of 
tinkering can be traced. Injections were something that “needed a bit of 
time to sort through” (Catherine); “normalising it and sort of working a 
way around how it will be delivered” (Kelly). Administering depot in-
jections was a new skill for some clinicians, especially psychiatrists who 
did not usually perform these procedures. Participants spoke of how 
they practiced these skills and, through time, learned to understand how 
different bodies responded to the depot injections (for example, under -
standing that clients with less body fat sometimes experienced more 
pain in injection sites): 
We practiced a few times. So, we [became] familiar with the injec-
tion and how to do it and about the angle and knowing to rotate 
around the sites, so that was helpful, and I guess, we knew to do it 
very slowly as well. (Susan) 
The work of tinkering is a practice of adaptation, done in incre -
mental, and sometimes small and mundane ways, in the everyday. By 
tinkering in the situation, new practice-based knowledge emerged. For 
example, different sites experimented with the use of ice packs to numb 
skin on the abdomen for 5–10 min, and others provided clients with 
lollypops to help pass time in the extended appointment and manage 
pain and discomfort sometimes associated with depot injections. 
Embedded in these small, practical experiments was a desire to make the 
relations of care work in the moment of administration: “whatever 
works […] even just the conversation about the lollypop, is a distraction 
in itself, you are not talking about the injection” (Saanvi). Making the 
injection events acceptable for clients, and especially managing local-
ised pain, was initially a key concern to help retain clients’ engagement 
with this novel treatment. When trying out new approaches, participants 
tinkered towards practices that would be manageable, balancing time 
with complexity, which was a situated concern. In this account, we were 
told why the use of ice packs was preferred in one service: 
Once you start looking at local anaesthetic or topical anaesthetics 
and things like that, it just becomes too complex. I think cooling the 
skin works well, so it just requires a little bit of time that’s all, so you 
know 10 min or so, 5 to 10 min of having something cool on the skin. 
(Catherine) 
In another community-based service, anaesthetic was used to save 
time: 
So now we are using local anaesthetic whereas before we just have to 
spend a lot of time injecting it really slowly, which you know in a 
busy clinic is you know it’s a waste of time really and even then it 
doesn’t completely stop or doesn’t mitigate against the pain terribly 
well. The other alternative we were using was ice packs and that 
would be time consuming for the patient, for our staff, and for the 
doctor having your patient sit there with an ice pack on their stom-
ach. (Peter) 
As changes in practice evolved, participants spoke of how they would 
“work together” (Robert), sharing new information between service 
providers through discussion groups and chats, as well as internal 
meetings, recognising that knowledge was constantly changing. There 
was an effort to remain responsive, to continually come to know how to 
work with a novel technology as it came together with clients’ bodies in 
evolving practices in different clinic situations, including by listening to 
feedback from clients themselves. This was especially evident in how 
participants spoke about how knowledge was reciprocally exchanged 
between staff and clients as they learned together what to expect from 
the event of injection administration, and as those expectations shifted 
through experience: 
It’s often because they are not sure what to expect you know, we 
were honest and said, ‘look, we have had feedback that this can sting 
a lot’ […] Some of them would say, ‘look, I hate the injection, it’s K. Lancaster et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
International Journal of Drug Policy 126 (2024) 104359
6painful but just that whole month of not having to come is worth it.’ 
So, certainly there was some negative feedback initially about how 
painful the injection was, but again I think it got better once the 
patients were used to it. We probably got better at giving them. 
(Susan) 
Tinkering with practices in time and space 
BUP-XR required adapting how time and space was allocated and 
worked-with in services. For some services, finding the space required 
for secure storage and refrigeration (as was required at the time of the 
study) was “the absolute number one obstacle ” (Susan). The challenges 
associated with ordering, dispensing, refrigeration and storage were 
“time consuming ” (Quang). Ease of access to appropriate refrigeration 
varied according to the facilities at each site and was more difficult to 
manage in services that were not connected to large clinic or hospital 
infrastructures. This meant that for some services, the spatial arrange -
ments of how BUP-XR was stored and where a fridge was located con-
strained how, where, and when care practices could happen: 
The restrictions1 about what you can have mean that you have to 
have a fridge inside a safe, rather than a securely lockable fridge. 
Actually, the space that would take is so big, that we haven ’t done it, 
because it would take away … the room where it could go, where we 
have our other safe is relatively small, and the nurses sometimes give 
injections in that room. So, we haven ’t got a fridge at the moment to 
store our available Sublocade without having to order individually 
just because of the space logistics. […] We’re still ordering for in-
dividual clients, and we have to plan, have to know who ’s coming, 
and let pharmacy know who ’s coming this week for an injection, and 
do a script for them individually. So, we still have that process for 
Sublocade and the logistics of that, we’re maintaining like that, 
because we don’t have easy space to put a large fridge. (Oscar) 
These challenges initially related to not only the storage of BUP-XR 
itself, but also to the storage of ice packs used when administering the 
injection: 
The other barrier we have too at the moment also is we are in the 
process of trying to get a freezer so we can keep ice packs for the 
patients for the administration. (Catherine) 
Spatial and material constraints worked to delimit adaptations to 
practice. 
Comparisons with the different spatial and temporal arrangements of 
supervised daily dosing of methadone and sublingual buprenorphine 
were frequently invoked when participants gave accounts of how they 
worked with BUP-XR: 
You’ve got to have the physical space to do it. It’s not like having a 
dosing area like in the methadone or buprenorphine clinic. You’ve 
got to have a room where we can take somebody. Ideally they can lie 
down, so you can give an injection, you’ve got to have the room for a 
little while, so people can wait afterwards and get prepared for it, 
and you can ask other questions, and that’s a different sort of 
encounter to a dosing encounter, which is normally at a window, sort 
of semi-public […] and that’s a different interaction to having two 
people in a room with the patient and the nature of the interaction is different, and a bit longer, and probably a little bit less formal, more 
interactive. (Thomas) 
This was not simply the substitution of one medication for another 
but a process of tinkering and working out, to attune the patterns and 
routines of treatment delivery and care to the new technology. 
Spatial and temporal arrangements were reconfigured so that BUP- 
XR injections could take place in a separate, clinical room. Clinicians 
folded their routine practices into the time and space the injection event 
created, for example beginning the assessment while the client was 
holding an ice pack to their skin, to prepare for the injection. The 
different time and space required to administer BUP-XR injections 
worked to slow down treatment interactions, and brought staff and 
clients into closer physical proximity, in turn reconfiguring practices to 
do with care: 
they are sitting there holding ice onto the injection site, [and we’d 
say] ‘So while we are waiting for the ice to do its thing, let’s keep 
chatting ’ and it just became a bit more flexible and it’s just adapting 
to you know the different types of interactions. It’s not like with 
methadone, you know you would have your assessment and then go 
to the window, get your dose and leave. You don’t want to keep the 
assessment going while they are taking their methadone, because it’s 
going to hold up the queue. [With BUP-XR] you’ve got 10 min to set 
them up and give them the injection and then chat to them after-
wards. And I noticed the nurses were often interacting a lot more and 
continuing their clinical assessment during the actual injection and it 
might be, ‘Hey how ’s it going? What have you been doing? How are 
your kids? ’ But, you know, that sort of stuff you could do while you 
are chatting, and in some ways, it relaxes them, so they are not so 
focused on getting the injection (Robert). 
Slowing down practices like assessment, due to the time and privacy 
created by injection as the mode of delivery, and the place it occurred, 
also had other contingent effects. These spatial and material adaptations 
to how and where clinical encounters took place were felt to reconfigure 
relations of trust within the clinic, with some participants speculating 
about how this might alter stigma and engagement with clients. BUP-XR 
was perceived to break down barriers characteristic of OAT service de-
livery (no longer "shouting through bullet-proof glass": Crawford, 2013 ), 
by moving the practices of dosing, and therefore care work, into a 
different material space: 
With methadone and suboxone […] we have got a locked door. […] 
A button ’s got to be pressed, and so you enter, then you are given 
your dose, and there is a glass screen, a perspex screen or glass, be-
tween the client and the clinicians. With the depot, it’s none of that at 
all. […] There ’s actually more trust I think with the depot, because 
it’s just not that perspex door or glass […] and obviously that’s going 
to improve the engagement and rapport with the client. (Breigh) 
Participants reflected on the relative comfort and stability experi -
enced by many BUP-XR clients, and the implications of this for care 
practices and especially scheduling of appointments over time: 
We have found that they have been very difficult to get, to attend 
scheduled appointments, and my view on that is because they feel 
very well and they certainly don’t feel like they are in any opiate 
withdrawal, they don’t necessarily prioritise their schedule and ap-
pointments that have been booked. So, if something else comes up 
for them on a particular day, then they, you know, may not come. 
(Catherine) 
This comfort forced a slowing down of care in other ways, disrupting 
procedures and the patterning of how and when clients would ordinarily 
connect with the clinic space, requiring practical adjustment to keep 
pace with the new temporal arrangements produced by the long-acting 
formulation in contrast to daily dosing: 1 For information regarding the specific requirements in New South Wales

7People do not necessarily turn up on time, because it’s lasting them 
for so long. So I guess, if I was saying to a colleague who was starting, 
I would say, ‘You need to be a bit more flexible about it and certainly 
don’t expect them to come on time or you know come on a set date’ 
[…] That I guess changes our approach to expecting that people will 
come at a set time and get a dose of medication, because we are 
thinking that we might need to be a little bit more flexible with some 
people who are stretching it out for much longer. (Susan) 
The potential for these new temporal arrangements to cause 
disconnection from the service as a material site of care was a key 
concern. The lack of regular, in person, on-site contact with clients made 
possible by long-acting formulations made visible other essential aspects 
of treatment and care being absented. Tinkering thus oriented towards 
caring for the care made absent in the altered treatment situation. 
Noticing the disentangling of psychosocial support from medication 
provision, one participant reflected on the future of OAT as something to 
be cared for, adapting practices in ways that maintain good care, not 
only through medication provision but also in relation to “the other stuff 
we do”: 
[BUP-XR clients] only come in once a week or once a month, whereas 
the other people are coming in every day for methadone or bupre -
norphine, or [even if] they’re only coming in a couple of times a 
week, they are still getting a lot more interaction than the people that 
are getting the long-acting product. […] What we offer on OTP 
[OAT], it’s not just about the medication, but it’s about the other 
stuff that we do, the other psychosocial stuff, and I think we just have 
to be careful in the future that we don’t lose sight of that. (Robert). 
Even as the long-acting formulation seemingly absented the need for 
regular contact, participants spoke of how they tinkered with routine 
practices, in consultation with clients, to maintain connection and care 
beyond the clinic. Participants reflected on how other practices could be 
folded in alongside BUP-XR, to enact care beyond the provision of 
medication itself, contemplating how and where practices such as 
follow-up could be integrated into the system and procedures at various 
points, for instance through case work and at prescriber reviews. Ac-
tivities beyond those usually regarded as clinical care in ‘treatment’ 
were also posited, as a way of keeping clients connected to community 
and social support: 
we were talking about trying to help people who had not much in 
their life, either by having groups or things – because of course the 
whole plan is for them not to have to come in – but we were looking 
at try to encourage them to have some other activity […] not just 
groups in here but trying to think for our clients of alternate activities 
or hobbies they could get involved with. (Susan) 
There were, however, other aspects of routine OAT practice absen -
ted, no longer seen to be as significant in the new, more diffuse, spatial 
and temporal relations afforded by the longer-acting formulation. For 
some clinicians, urinalysis was no longer felt to be an essential element 
of supervision or monitoring practices, given the way the treatment was 
made to work through time: 
There is much less focus on that [urinalysis] now […] I guess we feel, 
I am not going to say, less concerned, that’s not right, but it’s 
knowing that the depot is on board, I think the urine samples, you 
know, the purpose of obtaining the urine sample isn’t as important. 
(Breigh) 
At times, the extension in time and space created by the four or more 
weeks between injections became a concern to be managed. For 
example, one prescriber described with concern the case of one long- 
term methadone client who had commenced BUP-XR. They spoke of 
the isolation this shift had precipitated, as well as the individualised care 
arrangements they agreed to put into place to protect against the 
absence of connection made through the extension in time the long- acting formulation had made: 
I was a little bit concerned that he, you know, not having the regular 
contact and it could be 4 weeks. We made arrangements […] We had 
a plan in place that ‘If I don’t hear from you, I will contact your 
brother and make sure you are okay’. So it was all like an individual 
plan around that. ‘If I can’t find you then, do we need to do a police 
welfare check for you?’ (Kelly) 
Some participants recognised that what was lost in the shift to long- 
acting formulations was not the benefit of a daily dose per se, but the 
sense of routine connection to the clinic space and contact made in that 
alternate set of relations: 
Daily dosing can actually be helpful for some patients, even though 
the majority of people do want to have the freedom not to come in. I 
think a lot of people who are quite lonely, or they don’t have a lot in 
their life, it’s actually very meaningful for them to go to a pharmacy 
or to go to a clinic everyday […] it becomes a sad thing for them that 
they are not having that contact. […] There is a minority of people 
who don’t like that loss of contact with the staff. (Susan) 
The extended time between dosing was not only discussed as a 
challenge for clients, but as a challenge for clinicians, for how they 
understood their role in making care work. Relinquishing surveillance as 
a mode of care was felt as an adjustment, resetting years of routine 
practice: 
Having worked in the field for a long time, over two decades, I’m 
very conditioned to having very close monitoring of my patient 
group in the initiation phase of treatment and with this medication, it 
prevents you from monitoring because the patient doesn’t have to 
come every day […] As a clinician that you’ve administered some -
thing and then the patient leaves and they may have other health 
issues, other substance use issues going on and so on, but I think 
that’s conditioned from a long time of working in the field and how 
our treatment has typically been delivered. (Catherine) 
Tinkering with (in)flexibility 
The ‘game-changing’ promise of BUP-XR was troubled at times when 
it was felt that new practices and relations could not easily co-exist with 
the business-as-usual routines of OAT delivery. The altered relations, 
made possible by the added choice of a new technology, did not replace, 
but augmented the everyday care work required in services: 
There’s this expectation that we are going to have a lot more spare 
time, ‘what are the nurses going to do?’ […] There is not a lot more 
time available because we are actually still running the usual service, 
plus having the nurses to do the injections, so it’s actually more work 
at the moment. It’s not a bad thing because it’s good for the patients, 
but it’s certainly not freeing up any time for us. (Susan) 
To handle these emergent tensions, initially some services attempted 
to “quarantine” (Robert) BUP-XR care practices from the rest of the 
clinic, for example by scheduling appointments only one morning in the 
week, or administering doses in an entirely different space: “we split off 
into a separate depot opiate treatment team and we moved to a different 
site” (Catherine). This practical ordering worked to separate out BUP-XR 
care from other OAT care practices, containing new relations, and 
providing cohesion for staff working together with the new formula -
tions. In some services, this ‘quarantining’ productively altered relations 
of care with clients, who felt their care was being set apart as something 
exceptional: 
They said, ‘We really like being somewhere else, we don’t like being 
in the old junkie [sic] clinic with all of the people who aren’t going so 
well and now you know feel like sort of life is different and we are 
going somewhere else and we are doing something else, we are K. Lancaster et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
International Journal of Drug Policy 126 (2024) 104359
8moving on in life and not stuck with that other crew who aren’t doing 
so well’. […] Patients felt like they were being treated differently 
too, better, because of that change. (Thomas) 
The openness of some relations was, however, held in tension with 
inflexibility and closure in others. In contrast to the routines and ready 
availability of other OAT medications, managing the ordering, storage 
and dispensing of BUP-XR meant that for most services appointments 
generally needed to be booked in advance: “we have to plan, have to 
know who’s coming and let pharmacy know who’s coming this week for 
an injection and do a script for them individually” (Oscar). The refrig -
eration and shelf life of Sublocade, as well as guidelines specifying the 
dosing window,2 had implications for how clinics and workflow were 
structured, and how appointments were scheduled. Missed appoint -
ments had a cascade effect, which required additional work, following- 
up with clients throughout the week, so as not to miss the dosing win-
dow or waste medicine: 
We had a particular day […] they were a priority. We chose Monday, 
so that if anything happened and the patient missed or forgot to turn 
up, we still had plenty of days in the week for them to come back in, 
ideally Tuesday again which is a fairly well-staffed day and then you 
know the rest of the week to try and catch them before the Sublocade 
was out of the fridge and couldn’t be used […] We knew we had 
some time still to catch them. (Susan) 
The flexibility of a long-acting technology which absented the need 
for regular contact, was troubled as it entangled with the inflexibility of 
appointment systems, staff capacity, and clinic opening hours, as well as 
the material constraints of clients’ lives. Changing phone numbers or 
lost phones sometimes rendered some clients uncontactable for weeks at 
a time, which created tensions with scheduling and difficulties for 
continuity of care in the absence of regular clinic visits: 
I guess it’s just for us to kind of accept that and to try to just do the 
best we can […] We were telling them we need to have up-to-date 
phone and you please need to answer it but it’s an ongoing prob-
lem. (Susan) 
To mitigate against this loss of contact, and ensure continuity of care, 
one service implemented a new phone system, contacting clients more 
regularly via text messages: 
We now have a work dedicated mobile phone where we can send 
messages to patients so they know who we are and we are asking 
patients to contact the clinic and that’s made a difference and people 
are contacting us to let us know that they are okay. (Catherine) 
To harness what BUP-XR could do, in terms of the flexibility it 
afforded in clients’ lives, there was a sense that services needed to adapt 
to become more flexible to make care practices work: 
If you want to have a service that’s flexible and trying to meet peo-
ple’s needs […] you just need to have enough staff that you can be 
flexible about when you give it, so, I think it’s far more suitable to 
clinics that are open most days of the week and have staff who are 
there most days of the week who can give it. (Susan) 
Over time, services found that much more fluidity in practice was not 
only possible but desirable, once the new technology had become more 
familiar: 
What we realised is that [limiting BUP-XR clinic days] was very rigid 
and the patients didn’t really like that, because if you were on long- 
acting, it doesn’t matter if you come a few days later […] The one good thing that came about with those medications is that maybe we 
need to be a bit more flexible. […] We’ve just learnt to relax a bit 
more, be a bit more flexible now that we are a bit more confident. 
(Robert) 
Through experiences gleaned through the early implementation 
phase, one service evolved its staffing arrangements, moving to a nurse- 
led model of care, recruiting a nurse whose role would be dedicated to 
delivering BUP-XR. This role was imagined to connect-up care, through 
the stretching of time that long-acting formulation creates, producing a 
thread of continuity for clients between the various practices that 
constitute ‘treatment’ in this arrangement: 
There’s a next step in the evolution happening now […] We’re going 
to employ a nurse to our clinic […] a nurse available to manage the 
medication, manage the injections but also there with the client 
questions and appointment changes and confusion […] So, having 
some case management support and then medication management 
injection support. (Oscar) 
Tinkering allowed for more open relations, for new care practices 
that departed from the routine and familiar, opening up the potential for 
how BUP-XR could be put to use and made to work in its new situation, 
as its situation evolved along-with its implementation. 
Conclusions 
Implementing a new technology is not so simple, and “there are al-
ways contingencies and surprises” (Mol, 2009, p.1757). It is widely 
recognised that intervention requires complex adaptation. But despite 
acknowledgement of complexity, there is little emphasis on how con-
tingencies and complexities are managed and worked-with in the 
practices of implementation (Byrne, 2013; Callaghan, 2008; Mowles, 
2014; Rhodes & Lancaster, 2019). In this analysis, we have attended to 
BUP-XR’s implementation as a practice-based matter of concern, shift-
ing attention to the “messy, material […] or tedious activities that tend 
to be difficult to do” (Mol, 2009). The concept of tinkering helps make 
visible material care practices, which are often small and mundane, and 
thus sometimes disappear from view. Our analysis draws attention to 
how alterations in the time-space of intervention has effects for how care 
is done, and for alterations within networks of care. Tinkering slows 
down the expectation of rapid and dramatic change; the practices on 
which this technology depends demand invention and adaptation (Mol, 
2009). These alterations work across different scales, with the localised 
work of implementation an element of more global shifts, with the 
absenting of particular aspects of care prompting reflection on the future 
of OAT as something to be cared for. By consequence, the introduction of 
novel long-acting formulations opens up both potentials and challenges 
for OAT delivery. Tinkering that is done to implement BUP-XR locally 
connects with a broader assemblage of trial and movement in the 
constitution of treatment. 
Our analysis draws specific attention to tinkering as a practice of 
adaptation which comes together in an assemblage of evolving spatial 
and temporal relations to make BUP-XR work (Mol et al., 2010; Rhodes 
& Lancaster, 2019). Borrowing from Cussins’ (1998) concept of chore -
ography, Law (2010) emphasises the coming together of technologies 
with other material elements to make up care, thus drawing attention to 
the intricate ordering and effort that goes into such organisation. Law 
notes that “what may sometimes appear to be simple from the outside 
never is in practice”. We have seen in our analysis how care is choreo -
graphed through space and time, including in the coming together of 
staffing rosters, room allocations, appointment booking systems, fridges, 
ice packs, phones, and even lollypops. Our analysis also shows how OAT 
care is made multiple (Law, 2010), and how practices to do with care are 
not always compatible and do not always cohere. The introduction of 
BUP-XR shows how different care practices in OAT can be in tension – 
BUP-XR care depends on spatial-temporal arrangements that separate it 2 The dosing window for the monthly injections is from two days prior to the 
due date, and up to 14 days after the date the monthly injection is due, though 
state guidelines currently enable administration for up to 8 weeks from the last

9from the routine everyday practices of supervised daily dosing of 
methadone for example. However, this attempt to separate (spatially, 
temporally) nonetheless entangles and makes effects, altering the clinic 
assemblage and what treatment can do. Moreover, the very flexibility 
afforded by long-acting formulations was sometimes held in tension 
with the inflexibility of the time and space required for the adminis -
tration of injections. Following Law (2010), we observe that “care de-
pends not so much on a formula as a repertoire that allows situated 
action”. 
This analysis identified a concern for what is made present and what 
is made absent in the altered care network affected by BUP-XR. The 
multiple effects of supervised daily dosing practices are thrown into 
relief as they become absented. The disentangling of medication provi -
sion from practices of psychosocial support is one example, which raises 
not only the question of how to protect such care as it becomes absent, 
but also whether the clinic or the dosing event are the only (or best) 
temporal and spatial sites for delivering such care. We suggest this 
practice-based learning has relevance not only for BUP-XR, but also for 
the more restrictive practices of sublingual buprenorphine provision in 
some countries (see Kleinman et al., 2022). In this analysis, we have seen 
new practices emerge to handle the tensions between different objects 
and technologies of care, including an orientation to flexibility, as far as 
arrangements can stretch within material constraints. What we see here 
is a set of practices for “holding together that which does not necessarily 
hold together” (Law, 2010) – tinkering and experimenting, holding 
together, and apart, different enactments of care in OAT. We find, then, 
that tinkering is a practice which manages difference and tension, rup-
tures and break down, but more than this, also works to enhance good 
care as potentials are opened up. We argue that the disruptive potential 
of long-acting formulations must be understood within these wider re-
lations. We also emphasise that there is a need for approaches which 
better attune to noticing how this ‘good care’ is done. 
Reflecting on the potential for BUP-XR in OAT, it has been noted in 
the clinical literature that “without real system change, it may be that 
the impact of these medications will be missed in the future” (Ling et al., 
2019, p.76). Indeed, in some settings, including North America where 
concern about opioid overdose is particularly urgent, scholars have 
emphasised the need to look beyond clinical trial outcomes and better 
understand ‘real world’ implementation practices to help mitigate 
against discontinuation of treatment (Iacono et al., 2024; Morgan & 
Assoumou, 2023; Morgan et al., 2021). Innovative technologies such as 
BUP-XR bring with them new and different effects, and both the tech-
nology and the settings and practices in which it is used change in un-
predictable ways, requiring modes of evaluation that orient to the study 
of emergence and evolving experimentation (Pols & Willems, 2011). In 
many ways the discourse of biomedical promise of long-acting formu -
lations has located what needs to be fixed in drug treatment – the deficit 
– inside the ‘thing-in-itself’, in a technological effort to overcome the 
problem of retention in treatment. However, understanding innovation 
not as a ‘thing’ but rather as a continuous process of transformation 
opens up consideration of how innovation might itself be harnessed as a 
technology of improvement in drug treatment wherein deficit can be 
explored in the practices of implementation. As Pols and Willems argue, 
“rather than promises that technologies will, by their sheer installation, 
‘fix’ something, there is a need for more modest accounts of technologies 
in practices, details about ways in which technologies are working, who 
is using them and what goals are brought into being” (p.496). 
By attending to tinkering as a continual practice of adaptation, our 
aim is to contribute to the generation of ‘modest’ accounts, so as to 
“strengthen care practices” (Mol et al., 2010, p.11) and illuminate the 
material conditions and relations which help shape change. This is a 
practical challenge, and by no means limited to BUP-XR. As Rhodes and 
colleagues (2023, p.16) note, “noticing the tinkering that is done to 
navigate constraining relations also guides the potential for social and 
structural change”. We have shown, through this analysis, that change is 
possible. The introduction of long-acting formulations has potential to re-open questions about embedded practices and arrangements in drug 
treatment services, including supervised dosing, bullet-proof glass, uri-
nalysis, and the time and place of psychosocial support, as well as 
consider how other social aspects of care might be recalibrated. Adap -
tations in the clinic assemblage can also open up new possibilities for the 
undoing and remaking of dynamic relations which afford the category 
dependency its stigmatising capacity (Treloar et al., 2022). Our analysis 
illuminates the potential of small and incremental movement, that cre-
ates practical difference, and is thus a form of care. Although the work of 
care in the context of drug treatment (or health services, more generally) 
may seem self-evident, directing attention to variations in practice 
through a socio-material approach helps to consider time, space, rela-
tional arrangements, and what is being practically done. Indeed, this 
approach might help to unpack and reconsider “what is actually done 
under the name of ‘care’ […] and what forms of care are prioritised at 
the expense of others” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015, p.707) in drug 
treatment. It is also a reminder that although new medicines might be 
hailed as ‘disruptive technologies’ with potential to change treatment, 
drug treatment is not static but always constituted by trial and move -
ment and characterised by continuous adaptations. Changes to 
appointment systems, rostering, and scheduling, for example, are all 
small innovations done in practice, which work to tinker towards good 
care. Small changes – tinkering as care – can make a profound difference 
to the relations of care. The difference made by tinkering towards good 
care can help reshape what it is that treatment is and can do.
