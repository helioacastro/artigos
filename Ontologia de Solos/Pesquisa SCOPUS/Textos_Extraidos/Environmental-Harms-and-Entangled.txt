Environmental Harms and Entangled Lifeworlds in the Russia- 
Ukraine War: A Relational Reframing of Transitional Justice
Janine Natalya Clark 
Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK
ABSTRACT  
This interdisciplinary article adopts a novel approach to thinking 
about the environmental impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war - and 
of war/armed conflict more broadly. First, it unpacks, drawing on 
original empirical data, how these impacts make salient the 
interconnectedness of human and more-than-human worlds, 
which it explores with reference to the concept of solastalgia. 
Second, the article situates its analysis of the war’ s environmental 
impacts directly in relation to transitional justice. Calling for a relational reframing of the field that gives expression to multiply 
entangled lifeworlds, it reflects on what this reframing might look 
like and emphasises two key ideas - care and listening.ARTICLE HISTORY

[W]e cannot understand what war looks like and feels like if we ignore the entanglements 
between humans and nonhumans. (Hromadžić 2022, 265)
Introduction
Nature has often been described as a ‘silent victim’ of war (see, e.g. United Nations 
Environment Programme [UNEP] 2022, 1). This does not mean, of course, that it makes 
no sound when it suffers. One can imagine, for example, the roaring sound of huge 
volumes of water rushing downstream when Russian forces destroyed the Kakhovka 
dam in Ukraine in June 2023 (Truth Hounds and Project Expedite Justice 2024 ), precipitat -
ing what the country
’s then Prosecutor General – Andriy Kostin – described as ‘probably 
the biggest environmental disaster in the history of independent Ukraine ’ (Stop Ecocide 
International 2023). Yet nature has long been a ‘
silent victim’ of war in the sense that its 
suffering and the harms done to it have too often been overlooked or marginalised. This 
neglect reflects the traditionally human-centred focus of International Relations (IR). As 
Cudworth and Hobden (2023, 399) point out, ‘International Relations as a discipline 
remains highly anthropocentric (see also Fougner 2021; Youatt 2014).

Against this contextual backdrop, it is significant that the environmental impacts of 
the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have attracted considerable attention, as evidenced by 
a growing corpus of scholarship on the topic (see, e.g. Filho et al. 2024; Richardson 
2023; Tsymbalyuk 2025; Węgrzyn et al. 2023). Such research is extremely important. 
Thirty-five per cent of Europe’s biodiversity, for example – which equates to more 
than 70,000 species of animals, plants and fungi (UNEP 2022, 29) – is concentrated 
in Ukraine; and biodiversity hotspots like the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve and its 
virgin forest provide a home to critically endangered species, including the European 
mink (World Wildlife Fund [WWF] and Boston Consulting Group [BCG] 2022). More 
broadly, we are facing a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss 
and pollution, which, as a recent report by Norwegian People’s Aid (NPA) and the 
Conflict and Environment Observatory (CEOBS) (2025, 4) underlines, makes it ‘more 
vital than ever that we understand and address the environmental consequences of 
armed conflicts ’.
This interdisciplinary article adopts a novel approach to thinking about the environ -
mental impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war – and of war and armed conflict more 
broadly – and makes an important contribution to existing scholarship on the topic. Its 
approach has two key elements. First, the article – which builds on a recent ‘
relational 
turn’ within IR (see, e.g. Cudworth and Hobden 2015; Kurki 2022; Leep 2023; Lipschutz 
2024) – examines how the war ’
s environmental consequences illustrate the late 
Deborah Bird Rose’ s (2011 , 119) argument that ‘
there is no way out of entanglements 
with multispecies communities ’. More specifically, it unpacks, drawing on original empiri -
cal data, some of the emotional responses of Ukrainian interviewees to the loss of their country
’s flora and fauna. It frames these emotional responses, in turn, as expressions 
of solastalgia – defined as ‘the pain experienced when there is recognition that the 
place where one resides and that one loves is under immediate assault (physical desola -
tion)
’ (Albrecht 2005 , 45). Solastalgia is a concept that is unexplored in conflict contexts, 
and this research expressly seeks to demonstrate its usefulness in countering very com -
partmentalised analyses of war that contribute to maintaining human/nature binaries.
Second, the article situates its analysis of the Russia-Ukraine war ’
s environmental 
impacts directly in relation to transitional justice. Rooted in liberal ideology, embedded 
in the ‘existing (neo)liberal order ’ (Sesay 2022, 258) and concerned first and foremost 
with violations of individual human rights, the field of transitional justice is strongly 
anthropocentric (Clark 2023; Viaene, Doran and Liljeblad 2023 ). It has given little atten -
tion to the environmental dimensions of war and armed conflict, and it critically neglects the many ‘
worlds of life ’ (Van Dooren and Rose 2016, 80) with which our 
own lives are inextricably intertwined. There is, however, some important research 
that challenges this neglect (see, e.g. Bradley 2017; Celermajer and O
’Brien 2021; 
Killean and Newton 2024 ); and this article brings something new to this corpus of 
scholarship. In using solastalgia as a lens for thinking relationally about the environ -
mental impacts of war, it calls for an ontological and epistemological reframing – 
and pluralisation – of transitional justice that acknowledges multiply entangled life -
worlds and takes them, rather than autonomous individuals, as its starting point. It 
also reflects on what this reframing might look like, highlighting in this regard the criti -
cal importance of extending (and reciprocating) care to more-than-human worlds and 
listening to them.2

Methodology and article structure
The article is based on original data from a research project that is close to completion. 
More specifically, it draws on two sources of empirical data. The first source is 33 semi- 
structured interviews, 30 of which were conducted via Zoom and three via email. Due 
to the project ’s focus on the environmental impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war, the inter -
view sample consisted mainly of scientists (all Ukrainian except one, who was Russian but living in Ukraine) – including botanists, ornithologists and herpetologists. However, I was 
also keen to explore the war
’s environmental dimensions from a variety of different per -
spectives, and for this reason the sample further included nine Ukrainians without 
environmental expertise; among them were an English teacher, a historian and a software 
engineer. Additionally, as one of the project ’
s core aims was to demonstrate that the 
environmental consequences of war are hugely significant for how we think about and 
operationalise transitional justice, I interviewed two Ukrainian lawyers, one of whom 
was based in the Office of the Prosecutor General. I conducted five of the interviews 
with the aid of an interpreter and the rest in English. As some of the interviewees, 
however, were not used to communicating in English and lacked confidence, the 
interpreter was present in these cases to assist if necessary. After each interview, I 
checked and ‘cleaned up’ the Zoom transcript, coded it in NVivo – using mainly open/ 
inductive coding – and made some post-interview notes.
The second source of data is acoustic, in the form of soundscape recordings. There 
exists a rich corpus of scholarship focused on soundscape ecology, broadly defined as 
all sounds – non-biological natural sounds (geophony), biological sounds (biophony) 
and human-made sounds (anthropophony) (Krause 2016 , 2
–3) – that emanate from a 
given landscape ‘to create unique acoustical patterns across a variety of spatial and tem -
poral scales ’ (Pijanowski et al. 2011, 204; see also Farina 2014; Gasc et al. 2017; Krause 
2013, 2015). As a novel application of soundscape ecology – a concept overlooked in 
conflict contexts – I asked all research participants to make two short recordings, using 
their mobile phones, of their local soundscapes. The main idea was to explore some of 
the acoustic aspects of the Russia-Ukraine war and their effects on more-than-human 
worlds (see Clark 2025a). Interviewees uploaded their recordings onto a secure website 
hosted by the University of Birmingham and I asked them some questions about the 
recordings during the interviews (including ‘
How has your soundscape changed since 
the start of the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022?’). I coded interviewees ’ responses 
to these questions in NVivo and I also made detailed pre-interview and post-interview 
notes. Some of the recordings are included in this article as endnotes. Full ethics approval 
for the research was granted by the Humanities and Social Sciences Ethics Committee at 
the University of Birmingham.
The article
’s first section outlines some of the environmental consequences of the 
Russia-Ukraine war. It draws on the interview data and particularly engages with the 
work of Ukrainian scholars, scientists and journalists, in acknowledgement of Tsymba -
lyuk
’s (2023 , 248) argument that using a decolonial lens is important for addressing 
‘
the marginalization of Ukrainian voices and knowledge about Ukraine ’. The second 
section accentuates the relational dimensions of environmental destruction. It uses the 
interview data and soundscape recordings to explore and analyse some of the intervie -
wees ’ emotional responses to the war ’
s environmental impacts, discussing these JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 3
responses as expressions of solastalgia and, by extension, of deep connections between 
worlds. The third section foregrounds and discusses the significance of these connections 
for transitional justice, through a specific focus on the aforementioned concepts of care 
and listening.
The Russia-Ukraine war and more-than-human worlds
Interviewees who took part in this research frequently talked about the impact of the 
Russia-Ukraine war on animals. Prior to the full-scale invasion in February 2022, for 
example, one of the ornithologists interviewed had been closely observing a colony of 
cormorants in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) in northern Ukraine. The CEZ was created following the Chornobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and it is often described as a 
‘haven ’ for wildlife (see, e.g. UNEP 2020), although this does not tell the entire story 
(see, e.g. Turnbull 2020
). The interviewee explained that: ‘
I observed the birds for many 
years along the waterbed of the Pripyat River, which runs through the Chornobyl Exclu -
sion Zone. There were around 70 nests, and so it was quite a big colony
’ (interview, 31 
January 2025). When he resumed his studies in 2023, however, the entire colony had 
gone. He maintained that the intense sounds of war and combat during the first weeks 
of the full-scale invasion, as Ukrainian and Russian forces fought for control of Chornobyl 
(Mohammed and Landay 2022), likely frightened the birds, causing them to leave and 
nest elsewhere.
An interviewee involved in monitoring birds in Tuzlivski Lymany National Park in Odesa 
region emphasised that some species, including flamingos, are particularly sensitive to 
noise disturbances; and he expressed concern about the effects of acoustic stress on 
migratory birds, such as avocets (interview, 30 June 2025). Certainly, there is significant 
research to be done on the war
’s acoustic impacts on birds (and other animals). One 
study has found that the conflict has had a ‘noticeable impact ’ on Greater spotted 
eagle migratory behaviour (Russell et al. 2024; see, however, Hubareva and Viter 2024).
Another interviewee detailed some of the ways that the war has affected animals living 
in the Falz-Fein Askania-Nova Biosphere Reserve, Ukraine
’s oldest nature reserve (estab -
lished in 1898). Askania-Nova has been under Russian occupation since the start of the 
full-scale invasion. The interviewee spoke about aircraft flying at low altitudes over the 
reserve, which causes panic and fear among the animals. Some of them have been 
injured or killed while trying to escape (see also Vasyliuk 2023); and cases of stress- 
induced miscarriage among Przewalski
’s horses – an endangered species of horse that 
was previously extinct in the wild – have been reported (Mankovska 2024 ). The intervie -
wee particularly emphasised the impact of Russian mismanagement (largely due to incompetence and lack of relevant knowledge) of the reserve, which he described as ‘
a 
very finely tuned system’ (interview, 22 November 2024). There have been issues, he 
noted, with proper supplies of food and medicine for the animals, and approximately 150 Saiga antelope were found dead in 2023. The probable cause of their death was an infectious disease (see also Mankovska 
2024).
One of the biggest losses of animals – and one that can never be fully quantified – 
resulted from the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in June 2023, referred to in the 
article
’s introduction. Due to the massive breach of the dam and the rapid surge down -
stream of huge amounts of water from the Kakhovka reservoir, thousands of fish, 4 
 J. N. CLARK
molluscs, insects and other species perished (Hryhorczuk et al. 2024). Some animals died 
after being flushed into the Black Sea. As a herpetologist explained, ‘We are afraid that a 
considerable part of the population of amphibians from the lower course of the Dnipro 
River was killed because amphibians are not adapted to survive in the sea ’s salty 
waters ’ (interview, 4 March 2025). Additionally, the flooding of local areas destroyed 
breeding/nesting and feeding grounds (UNEP 2023); and many pollutants – including 
machine oil, industrial waste and landmines – were washed into the Dnipro River and 
Black Sea, affecting aquatic and marine ecosystems (Kvach et al. 2025; Vyshnevskyi 
et al. 2023). An advisor to Ukraine ’s Prosecutor General confirmed that the destruction 
of the Kakhovka dam and its myriad consequences are being investigated as a possible case of ecocide (interview, 16 December 2024). Currently, ecocide cannot be prosecuted 
in international criminal law – although there is growing momentum to add it to the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (see, e.g. Stop Ecocide International 
2025). The crime is included, however, in Ukraine ’s Criminal Code (Article 441).
Interviewees also frequently spoke about the impact of the war on forests. One of the 
experts on this topic noted that physical damage to forests caused by shelling creates tree 
wounds, which can then become ‘pathways for pathogen penetration, development of 
rot and mortality and colonisation by xylophagous insects [i.e. insects that feed on or in wood]’ (interview, 8 July 2025). Ukraine’s forests – which comprise 16 per cent of 
the country’s total land area (WWF 2024) and include some rare natural old-growth 
forests – have also suffered extensive fire damage, a very visible illustration of the 
concept of ‘injured landscapes ’ (Hromadžić 2022, 265). According to Cazzolla Gatti 
et al. ’s (2025) research, for example, most of the regions affected by the war showed a 
high increase in forest loss in 2022 and 2023 compared to 2021;
1and a recent Reuters 
report includes powerful images and aerial video clips of burnt forests within the Sviati Hory (Holy Mountains) National Park in eastern Ukraine (Peter and Hunder 2024). In 
Sviati Hory National Park and in Kreidova Flora, a steppe (grasslands) reserve also in 
eastern Ukraine, military actions and fires ignited by aerial bombardments and explosive 
weapons have caused significant damage and harm to extremely rare pine forests on 
chalk outcrops (Spinova, Kuchma and Vyshenska 2019, 45; Tsymbalyuk 2023
, 254). 
These forests have been recognised (in 2018) by the Standing Committee of the Bern Con -
vention2as an endangered habitat.
Fires, in turn, degrade air quality, releasing toxic pollutants into the atmosphere. Fur -
thermore, new fire risks are accumulating, linked, in large part, to unexploded ordnance 
(UXO) – including landmines (Matsala et al. 2024). Risks from UXO, as well as factors such 
as the proximity of the frontline and the loss or confiscation of crucial equipment, also 
have a substantial impact on forest management – and on the speed and effectiveness 
of firefighting operations. For example, after Russian-backed separatists in eastern 
Ukraine declared the existence of the so-called Donetsk People
’s Republic and Luhansk 
People’s Republic in 2014,3they seized and confiscated all firefighting equipment, sub -
sequently redeploying it for military purposes against Ukrainian armed forces (Vasyliuk, 
Kolomitsev and Parkhomenko 2024).
The explosive munitions (including drones, missiles and artillery shells) that are a major 
cause of forest fires create heavy cratering and ‘
bombturbation ’ (Hupy and Schaetzl 2006) 
of soil surfaces. By disturbing and eroding the top layers of the soil, they affect the area ’s 
hydrology and vegetation (Certini, Scalenghe and Woods 2013, 2); and the breakdown of JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 5
explosive materials – including landmines – causes extensive soil contamination (Certini 
and Scalenghe 2024; Pereira et al. 2022; Solokha et al. 2023). Filho et al. ’s (2024) research, 
for example, which involved the collection of 63 soil samples from four different combat 
zones (all of them protected areas) in October 2022, found that in all cases, there was ‘a 
clear accumulation of metals in the upper humus horizon ’.
The consequences of soil contamination from heavy metals can be extensive and 
long-lasting, affecting, inter alia, crucial microbiological and biochemical processes and building up in the food chain (Shebanina et al. 2024, 209). As one of the biologists 
highlighted, ‘Pollution of different biotopes in areas of military activity will continue 
even after the war ends because a lot of chemicals from bombs and explosives will remain in the soil, in the water, in plants ’ (interview, 11 December 2024). Other war- 
related activities – including the movement of military vehicles and equipment, the 
loss or abandonment of tanks, the construction of earthworks and the occurrence of mass burials – also contribute to soil disturbance and damage (Solokha et al. 2023; 
Tsymbalyuk 2025). Additionally, soil pollution in the form of radioactive leaks from 
attacks on nuclear power plants in Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia presents a serious 
ongoing risk (Aikman 2025).
The aim of this article, however, is not just to outline some of the many environmental 
impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war. It also seeks to demonstrate that these impacts have 
important relational dimensions. Damage to soils that are ‘indispensable to terrestrial 
socioecologies ’ (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 2020, 192), for example, necessarily 
affects myriad lives; contaminated soil runoffs pollute rivers, which are ‘life-generating 
both for human and non-human ecologies ’ (Yaka 2019, 359); and the inhalation of 
smoke from forest and landscape fires highlights the concept of trans-corporeality 
(Alaimo 2008). As Verlie (2022
, 297) argues vis-à-vis the devastating bushfires that 
occurred in Australia in 2019/2020, ‘
[i]n breathing the smoke, we inhaled incinerated eco -
systems, and the tiny particles of charred multispecies bodies made their way into our lungs, our blood, our organs, our brains ’
.
The article
’s accent on relationality, however, is not intended to detract, nor does it 
detract, from the scale of environmental harms occurring in the context of the Russia- 
Ukraine war (or indeed any war). Rather, it is a way of reflecting on these harms that 
draws attention to, and foregrounds, interconnected and entangled lifeworlds (Debaise 
and Stengers 2022; Escobar 2011; Haraway 2008; Probyn 2023 ). Ultimately, and by exten -
sion, it is a novel way of challenging – as the final section demonstrates – the anthropo -
centricity of transitional justice that leaves intact the false ‘
analytical separation between 
nature and humanity’ (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi 2020, 194).
Thinking about environmental harms through a relational lens
War is a deeply relational phenomenon and one that illustrates the posthumanist idea of the human ‘as necessarily enmeshed in a multiplicity of relations with human and nonhu
-
man others ’ (Radomska 2016, 16). Scholars have explored this enmeshment through a 
focus, inter alia, on assemblages of human and other-than-human actors in war (Fish 
and Richardson 2022), interspecies belongingness (Leep 2018), entangled security 
threats (Mitchell 2014) and ‘
afterlives ’ that highlight how war ‘persistently propitiates 
new social forms and relations, even long after the bullet and the shrapnel have fallen 6 
 J. N. CLARK
to the ground’ (Ruiz-Serna 2023a, 546). Some scholarship on the Russia-Ukraine war also 
encapsulates a variety of relational themes.
Tsymbalyuk, for example, articulates how she used her drawings of plants in the Krei -
dova Flora nature reserve, currently under Russian occupation, to tell stories about them – 
and how Ukrainians (in London, Scotland and Tbilisi) responded by sharing with her their 
own stories and memories about these plants. Her work thereby elicits some of the con -
nections between Ukrainians and these more-than-human worlds. She also encouraged everyone to draw a plant, emphasising that stories with/about plants through drawings 
‘
guided us on an imaginary trip to the lands now occupied by Russia and allowed us 
to see and visualize some of the inhabitants for whom Kreidova Flora has been a home 
under threat ’ (Tsymbalyuk 2023, 258). Further illustrating such connections, Zaiets 
highlights the fact that when the city of Kharkiv – located just 30 kilometres from the 
Russian border – was facing a barrage of rocket attacks in May 2022, tulips and violets 
were being planted in its main flower beds. Flowers, he underlines, ‘
need daily care: 
they are watered, weeds are removed, the soil is loosened – and all this against the 
background of empty streets and shelling from barrel and rocket artillery’ (Zaiets 2024, 
184; see also Murza 2024, 147).
Expanding on the theme of care, various studies have discussed people looking after 
and protecting animals during the war. Kulyk and Prylutska focus on the work of staff at 
the Zgraya Shelter in Zaporizhzhia, a city close to Ukraine’s southern front line. Stressing the unwavering dedication of staff at the shelter – which was established in 2014 to 
provide assistance to animals – they maintain that ‘[t]he full-scale war has revealed the 
power of love, thirst for life and consideration for others ’ (Kulyk and Prylutska 2023, 7). 
Kuzmenko and Koshlanskaya (2022
) have written a deeply moving article about Kuzmen -
ko’
s experiences of single-handedly caring for reptiles in the Reptiles Breeding Centre – 
located in Kharkiv region – for a period of 80 days amid constant attacks from Russian 
forces. Smith and Kuzyo ’s (2024) work, to take a further example, analyses videos 
posted on social media to examine some of the ways that Ukrainian soldiers on the 
front line have extended care to frightened and hungry animals (see also AFP News 
Agency 2022; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 2023).
This section makes its own important contribution to these relational tropes, specifi -
cally by exploring some of the emotions that interviewees shared and expressed – 
linked to the aforementioned concept of solastalgia (Albrecht 2005; Albrecht et al. 
2007 ) – when discussing the war
’s environmental impacts. It could be argued that to 
thus emphasise interviewees ’ emotions – including grief and sadness – is simply reverting 
to a human-centred approach. Yet the article attaches significance to these emotions pre -
cisely as psychoterratic states reflecting our connectedness with more-than-human 
worlds.4To cite Gillespie (2016, 584), ‘[w]e grieve what we know and what we care 
about and what we feel as a loss ’.
It is well established that sound can evoke emotions (see, e.g. Algargoosh et al. 2022; 
Huron 2015). In the context of this research, some interviewees particularly expressed 
emotion when speaking about and reflecting on their soundscape recordings. As an 
example of how such recordings can richly communicate what Krause (2013 , 4) has 
called ‘
the acoustic texture ’ of a particular environment, a zoologist shared a recording 
that he made in a steppe area of Luhansk region in 2013, a year prior to the commence -
ment of war in eastern Ukraine. The entire recording – which is a little over one minute JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 7
long – captures the repeated call of a steppe marmot5and some faint bird sounds in the 
background. Discussing the recording’s personal significance to him, and describing the 
area in which it was made as his ‘favourite place on Earth ’, the interviewee revealed: 
I am afraid that I will never be able to hear steppe marmots again and that I heard them for 
the last time in 2013.6In 2014, this territory was occupied, and it is occupied now. And I 
decided to share the recording because it is probably the last memory of a place that I want to go back to. These are the sounds that I’m dreaming of listening to in the wild. (inter
-
view, 20 September 2024)
One of the botanists uploaded a recording that he made a few hours before the interview, 
while walking through a park in Kyiv on his way to work.7There is the sound of wind and 
of birds calling; the rooks are particularly prominent. When asked about the recording and how he felt when he listened back to it, he explained: 
It reminds me of the winter landscape in Askania-Nova when winter starts and we have the 
very first snow on the trees and the sounds of rooks, the sounds of birds. I really started to think about my days in Askania. Here in Kyiv, we can still hear natural sounds, but they 
cannot be compared to the sounds of nature that we have in the biosphere reserve, in the 
steppe zone of Ukraine. By the way, today we have the first snowfall in Kyiv and it has 
really evoked some nostalgic feelings in me. (interview, 22 November 2024)
This sense of nostalgia has important geographic dimensions, linked to the interviewee’s 
physical distance from Askania-Nova. It is a nostalgia that results from ‘the gap between 
where we are and where we once were and/or where we want to be’ (Bonnett 2015, 2). As 
previously noted, however, Askania-Nova has been under Russian occupation since the 
start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 and has been affected by the war in many ways, 
which the interviewee spoke about at length. Taking account of this larger context, the 
above passage of text also thus contains elements of solastalgia – ‘longing, melancholy 
and anguish for a lost place’ (Askland and Bunn 2018, 18), the future of which is currently 
very uncertain.
The relationship between the environmental impacts of the war, sound and emotion 
also emerged in other more indirect ways. One interviewee recorded silence at midnight,8
describing this as a ‘luxury’ in Kyiv. The previous night, she explained, there had been 
multiple air raid alarms9(a sound that several interviewees recorded)10and drone 
attacks, making it impossible to sleep. Her recording is an interesting acoustic illustration 
of how war can make prominent – and audible – ‘the value of silence’ , which often ‘goes 
unheard’ (Eng 2002, 92). More memorable than the recording itself, however, was the 
interviewee’s description of her first visit to the site of the former Kakhovka dam after 
it was destroyed – and the sense of silence that she evoked. She recalled: 
I was in this place after the catastrophe. There were dead fish everywhere and you can ’t help 
because there is just death. There are dead molluscs. Thousands, thousands, and you walk 
and you can hear the sound when you ’re walking on their shells. And they died. There are 
thousands of other creatures that also died. (interview, 27 September 2024)
As she spoke, I imagined her walking through this deathscape, the silence broken by the 
sound of her footwear sliding and crunching on the hard mollusc shells. I continue to do 
so whenever I think about this particular interview and its relevance to two questions that 
Stein (2007, 61) poses: ‘What do memories sound like? What do feelings sound like?’ 8

(emphasis in the original). The interviewee moved on to talk about some of the work that 
she is doing in the aforementioned Sviati Hory National Park in Donetsk region in eastern 
Ukraine. Noting that the forests there are now heavily mined and littered with explosive 
materials (Shevchenko, Horbatenko and Aljas 2024), meaning that few people go there, 
she commented that the sounds of explosions in the forest do not go unheard. Animals hear them – and die from them. As I wondered how her work might have 
affected her emotionally, she reflected: ‘We have a lot of material, but when you actually 
see what is happening yourself, it ’s different. There are feelings and emotions. And it ’s 
hard’. Although she did not elaborate, I could see those feelings and emotions on her face as I looked at her through the screen of my laptop. Later in the interview, while underscoring that ‘justice’ cannot exclude nature, she revealed: ‘It’s very painful to see 
how nature dies or to see these fires, to see these animals. I have seen animals die 
because of mines, explosions. I have seen them in pieces ’.
While this interviewee showed me many images through her words, an ornithologist 
did so more literally. Holding her phone up to the screen and sharing with me some 
online images of rare bird species in Ukraine, including the Great bustard (
Otis tarda) 
and the Saker falcon (Falco cherrug), she emphasised that the habitats of these birds 
were under threat even before Russia ’s full-scale invasion, due to anthropogenic press -
ures on steppe and forest-steppe zones. She also expressed her fears and worries – 
which can be viewed as an example of what Stanley ( 2023 ) has termed ‘
anticipatory solas -
talgia ’ – about how the war might be affecting these birds. Discussing Great bustards, the 
global population of which has declined in the last two decades (Alonso and Palacín 
2022), she noted that: 
They were breeding in Askania-Nova and who knows what is happening there now. There 
were also Great bustards in Crimea, and again there is the question of what is happening there now with these birds. We have no influence. We cannot even know if they are still 
there. (interview, 25 October 2024)
The interviewee stressed that ‘[n]ature, of course, has a right to be without our emotions ’. 
Yet she also wanted to convey that it was deeply painful to know that she might never 
again be able to visit some of the places where she has so many happy memories of 
observing birds and learning about them. She additionally spoke about the emotional impact of the destruction of Ukrainian forests, referring specifically to the Serebryansky 
pine forest in Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. The war has transformed this once 
lush and verdant forest – which has been the scene of fierce battles between Ukrainian 
soldiers and Russian aggressors – into a burnscape of bare and blackened trees, some 
of them reduced to small stumps protruding from the scorched forest floor (see, e.g. 
Sabbagh and Kochetova 2024). The interviewee reflected that ‘[i]t was an important 
nature reserve and now it ’s completely destroyed by artillery. It ’s very depressing and 
it hurts. Seeing photos of this destruction hurts ’.
Another interviewee made a soundscape recording of herself walking with her 
husband in a forested area of a park in Kyiv. There is the sound of their footsteps
11and 
then, very faintly, the sound of music playing. The interviewee made the recording on 1 October (2024), the Day of Ukrainian Defenders. The music was the Ukrainian National 
Anthem, and it abruptly jolted her back to reality; ‘there is a war here and nobody knows 
what will happen in a month, in a day’ (interview, 3 October 2024). It was while thinking JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 9
about the recording and listening back to it that she started to make sense of her confl -
icting feelings that day; she was happy to be with her husband, but she also experienced a 
strong sense of guilt and shame. She was relaxing and enjoying herself, while Ukrainian 
soldiers were dying on the front line.
This interviewee also spoke with emotion about a forest near her childhood home. She 
used to pick mushrooms in this forest with her mother; and up until the start of the full- 
scale invasion, she had continued to enjoy spending time there and foraging. Tsing (2012, 
142) highlights that ‘
[y]ou visit the spot enough, and you know its seasonal flowers and its 
animal disturbances; you have made a familiar place in the landscape’ (emphasis in the 
original). Familiar places, in turn, ‘are the beginning of appreciation for multi-species 
interactions ’ (Tsing 2012, 142). The interviewee described a particular period when she 
spent a lot of time in this forest as ‘one of the happiest in my life’ ; and she talked 
about wanting to help other people, through her journalistic and social media work, to understand ‘how beautiful the forest is, how valuable it is and why we need to save it ’ 
(she is actively involved in anti-logging campaigns). Since 2022, however, she has no longer been able to visit this forest, which is now heavily mined. Emphasising the 
threat that landmines pose to biodiversity and large animals (CEOBS 2024; Vasyliuk 
2024), she also stressed her sadness that ‘Russian soldiers have stolen a part of my life 
that was entangled with the forest ’ (interview, 3 October 2024).
In focusing not only on some of the environmental impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war, 
but, also, on some of the emotions that these impacts have evoked, explicitly or implicitly, 
what this section has sought to demonstrate and make salient is the power of ‘connections 
in a shattered landscape’ (Zaiets 2024
, 181). These connections, moreover, are highly rel -
evant to the field of transitional justice, offering an ontological starting point for developing expanded approaches that include rather than marginalise more-than-human worlds and 
‘
refuse the boundaries that cordon nature from culture ’ (Tsing 2012, 141).
Environmental harms, relationality and transitional justice
Thinking beyond liberal individualism
The field of transitional justice has given little attention to environmental harms resulting 
from war and armed conflict – and little attention to more-than-human worlds more 
broadly. There is a small but important and growing corpus of transitional justice scholar -
ship that seeks to address these gaps (see, e.g. Ariza-Buitrago and Gómez-Betancur 2023; 
Clark 2025b; Killean and Dempster 2025 ). It should also be noted that activism by Indigen -
ous and Afro-Colombian communities has catalysed some significant judicial develop -
ments in the context of Colombia ’
s Special Jurisdiction for Peace (see, e.g. Killean and 
Newton 2025; Ruiz-Serna 2023b). Overall, however, ‘
transitional justice mechanisms 
have rarely engaged with the harms inflicted on Nature’ (Killean and Newton 2025; see 
also Viaene, Doran and Liljeblad 2023 , 2); and given the field
’s origins and historical devel -
opment, this is largely unsurprising.
There is a fundamental link between transitional justice and democratisation (see, e.g. 
Barahona De Brito, Enriquez and Aguilar 2001) and the field has its roots in Western liberal 
ideology. As such, it privileges a particular way of looking at and understanding the world, marginalising non-Western and Indigenous onto-epistemologies (Zanotti 2025) that 10 
 J. N. CLARK
accentuate relationality and ‘kinship entanglements ’ (Todd 2017, 107). Transitional justice 
scholarship, moreover, has engaged little with important bodies of literature – including 
posthumanism (Braidotti 2013), new materialism (Barad 2003 ), multispecies justice (Tscha -
kert 2022) and more-than-human geography (Whatmore 2006 ) – that strongly echo Indi -
genous thinking (Todd 2016 , 8) by foregrounding connections between worlds. This 
neglect only contributes to preserving notions of human exceptionalism and ‘
the anthro -
pocentricity that permits societies to externalise the costs of unsustainable lifeways to 
other species ’ (Strang 2023, 477).
Existing discussions about transitional justice and environmental harms often take 
place within the larger context of calls to decolonise the field (see, e.g. Izquierdo and Viaene 2018). As a consequence, they often focus on countries in the Global South, 
and in particular Colombia. In linking environmental harms and transitional justice 
through a specific focus on Ukraine, this article offers something new. Additionally, its 
conceptual and empirical reflections on solastalgia are a novel way of highlighting and 
thinking about ‘
the relationality of human and non-human life’ (Yaka 2019, 355; emphasis 
in the original). This final section is specifically concerned with how to practically translate 
this relationality into transitional justice. Due to the limits of space, what follows is not a 
comprehensive discussion, but, rather, some exploratory ideas centred on the inter- 
related concepts of care and listening.
Caring for and listening to more-than-human worlds in transitional justice
If environmental destruction reflects a lack of care towards more-than-human worlds (Dowd 2022, 1290), rooted in the persistence of human/nature binaries, the relational 
themes that this article emphasises – by exploring the concept of solastalgia and the 
emotional dimensions of war-related environmental harms – make salient the significance 
of care. Relationships involve acts of care, and a question that is integral to a relational reframing of transitional justice, ontologically and especially epistemologically, is: 
‘What does caring mean when we go about thinking and living interdependently with 
beings other than human, in “more than human” worlds?’ (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017, 13).
As part of the answer to this question, it is essential to acknowledge the myriad ways 
that more-than-human worlds care for us. Puig de la Bellacasa (2015, 692) discusses in this 
context the importance of soil, ‘a living, interdependent community’ that provides a host 
of services fundamental to our wellbeing (see also Puig de la Bellacasa 2017
, 192). Kim -
merer, in her book Braiding Sweetgrass
, also offers many examples. To take just one, beau -
tifully evocative in its imagery, she notes that: ‘
My students are always different after root 
gathering. There is something tender in them, and open, as if they are emerging from the 
embrace of arms they did not know were there’ (Kimmerer 2013 , 225). There are further, 
more implicit, illustrations within the interview data. One interviewee, for instance, spoke 
about her depression and how her two dogs (one of them a former stray that she rescued 
in 2022) help her. In her words, ‘
[t]hey are keeping me more alive than I would be without 
them. I am lucky to have these fluffy bodies ’ (interview, 23 October 2024). Another inter -
viewee stressed that her interactions with other lifeworlds – she specifically spoke in this 
regard about immersing herself ‘
in a kaleidoscope of different sounds, different 
vibrations ’ – are a psychological source of strength and energy (interview, 13 November 
2024).JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 11
Examples such as these raise the further critical question of how transitional justice can 
reciprocate acts of care. A first and obvious step is to ensure that the harms done to more- 
than-human worlds in situations of war and armed conflict are not overlooked or margin -
alised. Reparations are clearly important in this regard (e.g. Almassi 2021; Killean 2021). It 
is also useful, however, to think about reparations in relation to Haraway
’s (2008 , 36) argu -
ment that ‘
[c]aring means becoming subject to the unsettling obligation of curiosity, 
which requires knowing more at the end of the day than at the beginning’. Curiosity 
thus defined arguably plays quite a limited role in many reparations processes. They 
are harm-centred, focused on calculating and monetarising harms, and they do not 
necessarily translate into ‘knowing more at the end of the day than at the beginning’ 
(Haraway 2008 , 36). This is especially the case if, ultimately, more-than-human worlds 
do not actually benefit from them. Expressing his concerns on this point, one of the inter -
viewees underlined that ‘
[w]hen we talk about reparations, one of the biggest issues is 
how they will be used. And I have no doubt that the money will not be spent on the 
environment ’ (interview, 24 October 2024).
Significantly, the relational reframing of transitional justice that this article advocates – 
which also meshes with a wider decolonising imperative (see, e.g. Watts 2013, 23) – does 
not only entail acknowledging and addressing harms done to more-than-human worlds. 
It also requires acknowledging and giving expression to their agency. As Iovino and 
Oppermann (2014, 3) underscore, ‘
[i]t is quite arduous for humans to declare their 
agentic independence in a hybrid, vibrant, and living world’ (see also Barad 2003; 
Bennett 2010 ). An important illustration of the agency of more-than-human worlds is 
their potential to regenerate and recover from harms. When speaking about the devas -
tation wrought by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, for example, interviewees also 
frequently highlighted that there is some encouraging evidence of species and habitats 
replenishing (Kvach et al. 2025 ). They particularly noted in this context that there is 
now a willow forest growing on the site of the former Kakhovka reservoir (Dzyba and Kyr -
iienko 2024). According to one of the interviewees involved in monitoring the site, ‘
[n]ow 
we have a young willow forest, and probably this is the biggest floodplain forest in all of Europe. If we allow this forest to restore, it will be an amazing habitat, and it will provide a lot of ecosystem services like carbon sequestration ’ (interview, 4 September 2024).
Existing discussions about ecological reparations and transitional justice largely 
neglect this regenerative aspect of more-than-human worlds. Yet one way of demonstrat -
ing care, as Haraway conceptualises it, and of showing genuine curiosity is to explore how 
reparations can support and work with ecosystem dynamics and processes. As one of the 
botanists reflected: ‘
[l]ife will always find its way, and we should carefully help it, but not 
think that we are smarter than nature’ . He was not saying, he stressed, that we should 
simply leave things alone, ‘but we should not think that we can do everything’ (interview, 
22 November 2024). Arguments such as these neither take away from the value of mon -
etary reparations nor minimise the harms that more-than-human worlds suffer in conflict 
contexts. They do, however, support the case for a thicker conceptualisation of repara -
tions that can contribute to fostering new knowledge about more-than-human worlds.
Another important way of showing (and reciprocating) care is through listening. Cel -
ermajer et al. ( 2021, 128) remark that ‘
once we suspend assumptions about what 
counts as communication, it becomes glaringly obvious that the ecological realm offers 
very loud statements: extinctions, fires, droughts, fish die-offs, ocean heatwaves, and 12 
 J. N. CLARK
more’. In addition to these ‘very loud statements ’, nature also communicates in more 
subtle ways, including through ‘breathlessness ’ (Neimanis 2019 , 503), reactions to anthro -
pogenic sounds (Krause 2016, 30) and audible shifts and changes in the content, texture 
and frequency of a soundscape (Galloway 2020, 84). Listening to more-than-human 
worlds is a different way of interacting with them that can foster deeper insights into, 
and understandings of the impacts of war. It also gives expression to and acknowledges 
what LaBelle (2021 , 77) terms ‘
acoustic relationality’, which is a dimension of the intercon -
nectedness of different lifeworlds. As the Potawatomi writer and botanist Kimmerer ( 2013 , 
333) reminds us, we are ‘
students of nature, not the masters ’ – and ‘[t]he very best scien -
tists are humble enough to listen ’
.
On one hand, listening to more-than-human worlds and knowing how to interpret 
geophonic and biophonic sounds requires specialised knowledge. This highlights the importance of making space within the field of transitional justice for a wider range of 
expertise, including, inter alia, zoologists and experts on bioacoustics. On the other 
hand, listening does not require specific skills or knowledge – several interviewees 
remarked on the value of citizen science and the usefulness of apps such as iNaturalist 
– and is a crucial part of what Haraway (2008
, 19) calls ‘
the play of companion species 
learning to pay attention ’. Asking interviewees to make recordings of their local sounds -
capes was one way of encouraging this attentiveness – and of thinking acoustically about 
some of the environmental impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war (Clark 2025a). Furthermore, 
many of the soundscape recordings, in various ways, evidence what Gallagher, Kanngieser 
and Prior (2016, 618) term ‘
expanded listening’, defined as ‘the varied ways in which 
bodies of all kinds – human and more-than-human – respond to sound’. In one of the 
recordings, for example, the interviewee is gently talking to her dog and trying to comfort her.
12In another recording, a dog howls loudly,13disturbed by the sound of 
an air raid siren. Reflecting on the recording, the interviewee who made it commented: 
When I re-listened to my first recording, I noticed just for a couple of moments the sounds of 
birds singing in the background – tits and sparrows. These are sounds of birds that are typical 
for my city, but I do not pay attention to them in my routine life. When I re-listened to my 
soundscape recording, I noticed them. (interview, 11 December 2024)
The key point is that expanded listening, and giving attention to the multiple impacts of 
sound, is an act of care that can potentiate new interactions in the context of transitional 
justice – and new perspectives that extend beyond viewing more-than-human worlds 
only as victims. As Tsymbalyuk (2023, 247) emphasises, for example, ‘All stories about 
war and displacement are profoundly multispecies ’; and the role of more-than-human 
worlds in these stories is not a passive one. They are storytellers in their own right (Gagliano 2018; Kimmerer 2016; Wooltorton, Poelina and Collard 2022), and listening 
to them – and with them – is a crucial way of forging what Van Dooren and Rose 
(2016, 85) have called ‘active sites for the ongoing weaving or braiding of stories, 
efforts to inhabit multiply storied worlds in a spirit of openness and accountability to 
otherness ’.
There are many possibilities for incorporating expanded listening into transitional 
justice processes, formally and informally. Prosecutors seeking to demonstrate evidence of environmental war crimes and ecocide, for example, could include soundscape record
-
ings into their arguments, thereby offering acoustic insights into ecological processes and JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING 
 13
changes. Soundscape recordings could also be used to create interactive memorials and 
museum exhibits. One of the outputs of this research, for example, is a unique online 
soundscape exhibition,14and this will be preserved in the British Library as an acoustic 
archive of the war that supports memory building. As Geismar (2005 , 4) notes, 
‘
[h]earing sound forces the listener to use their imagination and memory in a more crea -
tive way
’. Additionally, sound has a role to play in reparations processes. It is a potential 
source of information about both harms and wider ecosystem dynamics – and hence it is 
highly relevant, linking back to an earlier point, to thinking in expanded ways about 
reparations and what they might entail. Several interviewees noted, for example, that 
the current ban on hunting in Ukraine (in accordance with martial law) has benefitted some species, including deer; and one of the ornithologists made a recording – which 
she titled ‘A forest full of life’ – that captures the barking sound of roe deer
15in a horn -
beam forest in central Ukraine.
Of course, it could be argued that the act of listening is still performed by humans who 
choose whether or not to listen – and what they want to listen to. Yet this misses the fun -
damental relationality of agency, which, as Barad ( 2003 , 818) accentuates, ‘
is not an attri -
bute but the ongoing reconfigurings of the world
’. Listening, therefore, can never be just 
about human agencies. Rather, it involves and reflects multiple intersecting agencies that shape what we listen to, how we listen and what we ultimately hear.
Conclusion
In discussing some of the environmental consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war, this 
article has brought something new to existing literature on the topic. Drawing on original 
empirical data in the form of semi-structured interviews and powerful soundscape record -
ings, it has emphasised some of the relational dimensions of environmental destruction; and it has specifically invoked the concept of solastalgia – neglected in conflict contexts – 
to examine how such destruction affects people emotionally. Its use of the concept, to reiterate, is not about privileging human perspectives and making environmental 
harms secondary. Rather, it is about accentuating and foregrounding in a novel way 
the entanglement of different lifeworlds; and ultimately the article has explored how to 
translate this entanglement – or what Escobar (
2020, 7) calls ‘
the inexhaustible tejido 
(weave) of interdependence that sustains life and allows it to flourish ’ – into a relational 
reframing of transitional justice.
In unpacking what this reframing might look like, the article has underlined the con -
cepts of care and listening, and it has reflected on how to practically apply them in 
ways that acknowledge and give expression to other-than-human agencies. Care and lis -
tening also form part of the research methodology. The decision to include sound was aimed not only at addressing an important gap in existing scholarship on the environ
-
mental impacts of war, but, also, at stimulating curiosity about (and attentiveness to) more-than-human worlds – both in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war and more 
broadly. That the soundscape recordings – an example of biotic art (Prum 
2013) – are 
now publicly available, moreover, directly encourages listening as an act of care.
The late Deborah Bird Rose (2011, 119) reminded us that ‘
relational ethics for living and 
dying in the Anthropocene urge us to assume ever greater mutuality and accountability 
for intra-dependent members of the suffering family of life on Earth ’. These words have 14 
 J. N. CLARK
taken on added urgency in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, and it is incumbent 
upon transitional justice scholars and practitioners to take them seriously. This does 
not just mean prosecuting and seeking to repair harms done to more-than-human 
worlds. It also means, more fundamentally, reimaging ourselves ‘as one living part 
among many other-than-humans ’ (Fenske and Norkunas 2017, 109); and, by extension, 
it means being open to creatively exploring ways of doing transitional justice not only 
for but also with more-than-human worlds.

4. Significant in this regard are some of the discussions about solastalgia vis-à-vis the impact of 
climate change on Indigenous communities. Writing from an Aboriginal (Gamilaraay) per -

such as solastalgia ‘
are present in other forms in our yarns – sadness, loss, grief, loss, destruc -

’. In their own work, 
exploring how respected older women (‘Aunties ’) on Erub Island in the Torres Strait are 
experiencing climate and other environmental changes, McNamara and Westoby ( 2011 ,
