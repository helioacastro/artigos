solution

There is growing interest in enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) as a climate mitigation strategy, including neutralizing 
atmospheric emissions from fossil-  fuel combustion through the development of soil carbon offset markets. Several studies have 
focused on refining estimates of the magnitude of potential SCS or on developing methods for soil carbon quantification in mar -
kets. We call on scientists and policy makers to resist assimilating soils into carbon offset markets due to not only fundamental 
flaws in the logic of these markets to reach climate neutrality but also environmental justice concerns. Here, we first highlight how 
carbon offset markets rely on an inappropriate substitution of inert fossil carbon with dynamic stocks of soil carbon. We then note 
the failure of these markets to account for intersecting anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle, including the soil carbon 
debt and ongoing agricultural emissions. Next, we invite scientists to consider soil functions beyond productivity and profitabil -
ity. Finally, we describe and support historical opposition to offset markets by environmental justice advocates. We encourage 
scientists to consider how their research and communications can promote diverse soil functions and just climate-  change 
 mitigation.

Soil carbon is for sale. Shifts in land use can increase soil 
organic carbon stocks relative to current levels, and these 
potentials have been commodified in markets (Paustian 
et al. 2016; Fargione et al . 2018; Bradford et al . 2019; Vermeulen 
et al . 2019; Bossio et al . 2020). As global markets adapt to (i) 
climate change, (ii) potential regulatory pressures, and (iii) 
consumers’ environmental concerns, payments for soil carbon 
sequestration (SCS) have been proposed by corporations, 
organizations, and governmental agencies as a strategy to 
deliver climate- change mitigation. Among a variety of pro-
posed market- based solutions to climate change, soil carbon 
on agricultural lands can now be purchased as an offset to 
“neutralize” activities responsible for direct greenhouse- gas 
(GHG) emissions (Trouwloon et al . 2023). These offsets are 
sometimes used to support net- zero targets in GHG budgets for facilities, supply chains, and regional inventories (Keenor 
et al . 2021; Zelikova et al . 2021; Oldfield et al . 2022; Gelardi 
et al . 2023; Paul et al . 2023; USDA 2023). Here, we posit that 
this approach is fundamentally flawed and incongruous with 
environmental justice principles.
Soil carbon offsets are one strategy among several market- 
based approaches to climate mitigation. There are currently 
four compliance- based carbon offset markets in the US (USDA 
2023). These markets allow regulated facilities to comply with 
their legal requirements to reduce GHG emissions by purchas-
ing carbon offsets. In the US, these offset markets have gener -
ated credits for more than 200 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide equivalents (t CO2e) between 2013 and 2022, primar- 
ily issued in the context of compliance- based markets 
(USDA  2023). In addition, there are more than a dozen volun-
tary carbon offset markets in the US, which allow users to 
trade carbon credits outside of regulatory emission reductions 
requirements, often for the purpose of making climate- related 
claims in marketing. More broadly, in an analysis of climate 
neutrality commitments made by 482 large companies across 
sectors and across countries, nearly half of those companies 
explicitly intend to rely on offsets to achieve these commit-
ments, with most of the remaining half unclear about the 
degree to which offsets will be relied upon (Kreibich and 
Hermwille 2021).
Several recent studies have provided evidence to temper 
enthusiasm about the climate mitigation potential of SCS. 
Initial proposals for developing soil carbon offset markets 
have been critiqued for inflated estimates of SCS potential 
due to their failure to consider the limited capacity for min-
eral soils to sorb additional inputs (Abramoff et al . 2021),  
the increasing vulnerability of soil carbon stocks to 1New York University, New York, NY *(mustafa.s@nyu.edu);

• Soil carbon offset markets attempt to substitute inert fossil 
carbon stocks with dynamic soil carbon stocks
• The soil carbon debt must be restored in addition to, 
rather than instead of, reducing direct emissions
• Soil carbon offset markets account poorly for soil functions

the impracticability of increasing inputs to the magnitude 
required to achieve proposed soil carbon targets (Berthelin 
et al . 2022; Bruni et al . 2022; Janzen et al . 2022; Moinet 
et al . 2023), and other processes regulating carbon storage 
(Davidson  2022; Schlesinger  2022). Concerns related to soil 
carbon offset markets extend beyond the need to refine esti-
mates for the magnitude of potential SCS or mere improve-
ments to methods for measuring, monitoring, and verifying 
changes to soil carbon stocks. While we recognize the 
importance of improved quantification, we invite scientists 
to consider fundamental flaws to the logic of climate- change 
neutralization via soil carbon offset markets and broadly 
interrogate how their work supports or resists ongoing 
fossil-  fuel extraction, shapes political possibilities, and 
intersects with climate justice.
Navigating carbon offset markets may be relatively new to 
soil scientists; however, we can learn from the expertise of 
environmental justice advocates who have organized around 
issues of environmental degradation and developed positions 
on offset market- based mitigation strategies for decades. Many 
environmental justice advocates and frontline communities 
have a long history of opposition to market- based solutions to 
climate change (Cushing et al . 2018; CJA  2020; CorpWatch  2002; 
IEN  2023). We propose that scientists and policy makers learn 
from these lessons and join us to advocate for keeping offset 
markets out of soil.
Here, we outline four reasons to be wary of soil carbon 
offset markets for climate neutrality, ranging from biophysi-
cal limitations to environmental justice concerns. We focus 
our discussion on offset markets, which are a subset of 
market- based strategies to incentivize SCS, specifically relat-
ing to trading enhancements in SCS in one location to neu-
tralize emissions elsewhere. This commentary is not a critique 
of soil stewardship, restoration, conservation, or preservation 
efforts. Rather, we invite scientists and policy makers to 
reframe the role of soils in climate- change mitigation beyond 
the commodification of soil as GHG offsets, especially where 
regulatory or otherwise mandatory direct emissions reduc-
tions are possible, and to critically consider environmental 
justice in the development of climate solutions.
Dynamic soil organic carbon is not a substitute for 
fossil carbon
Soil organic matter is part of the dynamic carbon cycle. 
Carbon in soil can accumulate, saturate, disperse, and 
decompose through a diversity of biogeochemical inter-
actions, including inputs from leaf litter, plant roots, and 
microbial necromass, and outputs from decomposition by 
bacteria, archaea, and fungi (Jackson et al.  2017; Berhe 
et al.  2018). Microbial community dynamics, mineral 
interactions, climate, and other factors impact whether 
soil organic carbon persists for days, decades, or centuries 
(Sierra et al.  2018; Bailey et al.  2019; Cotrufo et al.  2019; Wiesmeier et al.  2019; Shi et al.  2020). However, even 
the oldest soil organic carbon is hundreds of millions of 
years younger than fossil carbon stored deep underground 
(and a greater disparity would exist in the absence of 
anthropogenic fossil- fuel emissions; Sierra et al.  2018). 
Due to rapid mineralization by soil microorganisms, less 
than 10% of organic matter inputs are likely to remain 
in soil a decade after their addition (Berthelin et al.  2022). 
In contrast, in the absence of industrial extraction, fossil 
carbon is largely inert and is not closely linked with sea-
sonal to decadal biological fluxes of carbon. Thus, inert 
stocks of fossil carbon inherently differ from even the 
most persistent stocks of soil organic carbon in terms of 
the timescales at which this carbon is likely to cycle through 
the atmosphere.
Soil carbon offset markets often obfuscate these distinc-
tions. Actors within offset markets may frame the dynamic 
nature of soil carbon as a limitation circumventable through 
advancements in technology and land- use management. For 
example, many offset market participants claiming neutrality 
treat these fundamental differences in permanence as uncer -
tainties that may be refined through improvements in biogeo-
chemical and economic modeling or by framing permanence 
as an issue primarily shaped by land management decisions 
potentially addressed through contractual language and buff-
ers (Demenois et al . 2022). Certainly, it will be critical to 
develop a better understanding of factors impacting persis-
tence, including the ways in which sociopolitical drivers shape 
land- use practices (Gosnell et al . 2019, 2020; Silva  2022). 
However, efforts to characterize the effects of soil management 
will not change the fact that fundamental differences exist 
between inert fossil carbon stocks and dynamic, biogenic soil 
carbon stocks.
The impermanence, volatility, and transitory nature of some 
forms of soil carbon are not necessarily flaws in need of correc-
tion. The dynamism of soil organic matter is a critical ecosys-
tem function, as decomposition makes nutrients available for 
re- uptake by organisms, enabling plant and microbial growth 
(for further discussion, see the section “Soils are more than 
carbon sinks” below). For example, direct releases of carbon 
from soils through microbial respiration are a function of 
decomposer activities, and this biological activity is even 
included in assessments of soil health (Allen et al . 2011). In 
this way, active cycling of carbon can be a critical component 
of soil function that is overlooked by offset markets that exclu-
sively seek to increase belowground stores of carbon to make 
carbon neutrality claims.
Restoring prior losses of soil carbon cannot neutralize 
ongoing direct emissions, including those from land- 
based sectors
Anthropogenic activities have multiple, intersecting 
impacts on the carbon cycle and climate. First, fossil- fuel 
combustion has removed 445 ± 20 petagrams of carbon 2 of 7   CONCEPTS AND QUESTIONS

Keeping offset markets out of soil(Pg C) from belowground fossil carbon stocks, transferring 
previously inert carbon into the biosphere (Friedlingstein 
et al.  2020). Second, agricultural activities and other land-  
use conversions can lead to removals of organic carbon 
from surface soils. The cumulative loss of 116 Pg C from 
the upper 2 m of soil globally over the past 12,000 years 
of land use has been termed the soil carbon debt 
(Sanderman et al.  2017). Third, agricultural land use 
incurs a carbon opportunity cost, or a reduction in seques-
tration relative to that which would occur over time in 
the absence of agriculture (Hayek et al.  2021). As a spe-
cific example, the cumulative carbon opportunity cost of 
land use for livestock production globally is comparable 
in order of magnitude to the past decade of fossil- fuel 
emissions, in the hundreds of petagrams of carbon (Hayek 
et al.  2021). Fourth, agricultural activities result in addi-
tional direct emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions from farm equipment, methane from livestock 
and manure, and nitrous oxide from fertilizer use. Offset 
markets fail to account for these overlapping impacts to 
the carbon cycle and climate, or in some cases, obscure 
ongoing emissions and prior losses from within the agri-
cultural sector (Paul et al.  2023). While increases in soil 
carbon may most directly address the soil carbon debt, 
offset markets propose that instead we credit efforts to 
restore soil carbon as an excuse for ongoing direct 
emissions.
Estimates of prior losses of soil organic carbon, like the 
soil carbon debt, have been used to calculate the potential 
for restoring soil carbon stocks on agricultural lands relative 
to current levels. These studies have formed the basis for a 
wide range of global and regional targets for increasing soil 
carbon, as well as revisions to previous estimates (Fargione 
et al . 2018; Amelung et al . 2020; Bossio et al . 2020; Berthelin 
et al . 2022; Bruni et al . 2022; Moinet et al . 2023). Rather than 
viewing the potential for SCS as an opportunity to neutralize 
fossil- fuel emissions via offset markets, these quantifications 
of prior soil carbon losses should be understood as their own 
distinct debt to be restored through shifts in soil 
management.
Distinguishing between the soil carbon debt, fossil carbon 
emissions, and changes in carbon sequestration is particu-
larly important in the development of counterfactuals used 
to determine additionality  within carbon offset markets. 
Additionality is the point at which increased carbon storage 
in one location is attributed to have occurred as a result of a 
given market intervention and therefore used to excuse 
emissions elsewhere. To determine which gains in soil car -
bon are deemed additional and eligible for compensation, 
offset markets compare soil carbon quantities under alterna-
tive scenarios or timepoints. The development of these 
counterfactuals is not simply a scientific question, but rather 
one representing sociopolitical and market visions of what 
concentrations should and can exist in a certain location 
under alternative land- use choices.For instance, one may arrive at different determinations 
of additionality depending on the following counterfactuals: 
(i) soil carbon concentration prior to major historical land-  
use changes (eg before deforestation for croplands), (ii) soil 
carbon concentration prior to the market intervention (eg 
before payments for adoption of cover crops), or (iii) soil 
carbon concentration accounting for carbon opportunity 
costs (eg predicted concentration with ecosystem restora-
tion). Offset markets often accept additionality to mean an 
increase in soil carbon using counterfactual (ii). Although 
this type of counterfactual has informed many global and 
regional targets (Berthelin et al . 2022; Bruni et al . 2022), it 
fails to account for the major impact of prior agricultural 
land- use conversion or to treat alternative land- use scenar -
ios outside of current modes of agricultural production as 
serious possibilities.
Continued agricultural production on existing acres, even 
when practiced with building soil carbon in mind, cannot 
pay back the soil carbon debt alone. Although shifts in land-  
use strategies can increase soil carbon stocks relative to cur -
rent levels (Lal  2001; Smith et al . 2005, 2008; Paustian 
et al . 2016; Bossio et al . 2020), estimates generated by 
Sanderman et al .  (2017) suggested that adoption of these 
management practices could at most only repay up to 30% of 
the soil carbon debt. Furthermore, the agricultural sector is 
not merely a sink for emissions but is also a source. In the 
US, agricultural activities are responsible for 36% of meth-
ane emissions and 75% of nitrous oxide emissions 
(EPA  2023). Recent analyses indicate that offsetting the 
warming effect of methane and nitrous oxide emissions 
from the ruminant sector worldwide would require nearly 
doubling the current global carbon stock stored in managed 
grasslands (Wang et al . 2023). While shifts toward practices 
that build soil carbon and reduce losses may help restore a 
portion of the soil carbon debt and offer other ecological co-  
benefits, these transitions should not be considered addi-
tional until the soil carbon debt has been repaid and 
agricultural direct emissions have been properly accounted 
for. Given the limited size of the soil carbon sink and consid-
erable ongoing and hard- to- abate agricultural emissions, it 
is unlikely that SCS can support both net- zero emissions 
targets within and beyond this land- based sector.
Scientists and policy makers may also heed the warnings 
imparted by several concerning projects focused on natural 
climate mitigation aboveground, in which biogenic stocks of 
carbon were offered as offsets to excuse fossil- fuel emissions 
without meaningfully increasing carbon sequestration 
(Anderegg et al . 2020; Haya et al . 2020; Coffield et al . 2022; 
Jones and Lewis  2023; West et al. 2023). For example, studies of 
aboveground forest carbon offset markets have repeatedly 
found that additionality has been exaggerated through mis-
leading counterfactual constructions and the reversibility of 
sequestered carbon. Badgley et al .  (2022) found evidence for 
systematic over- crediting of 30.0 million t CO2e in California’s 
forest carbon offsets program alone. In an analysis of voluntary CONCEPTS AND QUESTIONS   3 of 7

M Saifuddin et al .carbon offset market projects in six countries, West et al . (2023) 
reported that most projects failed to reduce deforestation sub-
stantially, and a subset of analyzed projects were used to offset 
nearly three times the amount of carbon emissions relative to 
their actual contribution to climate- change mitigation. Often 
such land- based projects may even incur additional emissions 
rather than remove atmospheric carbon (Paul et al . 2023). 
These cautionary signs are especially concerning as markets 
shift belowground, where assessment and verification of car -
bon stocks are even harder to confirm and as climate change 
makes soil carbon stocks increasingly vulnerable to decompo-
sition (Crowther et al. 2016; Soong et al . 2021; Wang et al . 2022).
Soils are more than carbon sinks
Offset markets narrowly focus on soils as sinks for carbon, 
which can often come at the exclusion of considering 
impacts on nutrients, water cycling, nitrous oxide and 
methane emissions, and other ecosystem processes. Soil 
organic carbon exists in a heterogenous matrix of organic 
matter with different stoichiometric ratios of carbon, nitro-
gen, phosphorus, and other nutrients. Thus, changes to 
soil carbon storage both rely on and impact soil nutrient 
availability, which in turn impacts plant productivity and 
microbial activity. Critically, interventions focused solely 
on building soil carbon can even result in increases of 
other soil- based GHG emissions (Lugato et al.  2018; 
Quemada et al.  2020).
Failing to account for these interconnections results in 
gross overestimations of SCS potential and unrealistic tar -
gets (Berthelin et al . 2022; Bruni et al . 2022; Schlesinger  2022). 
For example, on farm soils with crop biomass removed, the 
amount of nitrogen required to achieve a previously pro-
posed soil carbon concentration target of “4 per 1000” (0.4% 
per year) is greater than global natural and anthropogenic 
nitrogen fixation combined, and the amount of phosphorus 
required is a substantial proportion of global phosphate rock 
mined each year (Abramoff et al . 2021). Accounting for fac-
tors such as soil carbon saturation (Moinet et al . 2023), the 
priming effect of new soil carbon inputs on soil microbial 
activities (Guenet et al . 2018), the dependency of soil carbon 
stocks on photosynthetic inputs and nutrient uptake (Janzen 
et al . 2022), or the net GHG balance of soils (Lugato 
et al . 2018; Quemada et al . 2020) also dampens estimates of 
SCS potential. Wider systematic thinking needs to be imple-
mented when discussing the potential of rebuilding soil 
organic carbon, including trade- offs of soil and plant carbon 
sequestration with elevated CO2 (Terrer et al . 2021). Given 
the multifunctionality of soil carbon in organic matter, there 
are many reasons to both build soil carbon and reduce addi-
tional losses (Minasny et al . 2023) while bearing ecosystem-  
specific aspects in mind.
Soil organic carbon stocks also impact soil biodiversity, as 
microbes, plants, and other organisms are adapted to particular 
soil conditions (He et al . 2012; Yu and Chen  2019). Thus, changes to soil organic carbon may affect soil microbial com-
munity composition, with poorly understood impacts. 
Especially in low organic matter soils that support specialized 
species and high beta- diversity across regional scales 
(Fernandez- Going et al . 2013), adding organic carbon could 
change belowground and aboveground communities, resulting 
in biodiversity loss. Exclusively focusing on potential carbon 
storage has unknown consequences for the diversity of inter -
connected organisms living in and with soil. The dangerous 
consequences to biodiversity resulting from a singular focus 
on carbon have been obvious in the context of offset programs 
centered on aboveground stocks. For example, some existing 
afforestation programs have targeted large swaths of savanna 
for tree planting based on their designation as “deforested” or 
“degraded” , thereby undermining grassland biodiversity 
(Veldman et al . 2015; Bond et al . 2019).
Furthermore, the exclusive focus on carbon storage 
reflects a narrow and new teleology of soil health and func-
tion, in which low carbon storage is equated with poor soil 
health. This perspective can at times conflict with a prior 
focus on maximizing the availability of soil nutrients for 
crop production or, more broadly, alternative relations to 
soil and soil health beyond maximizing capital 
(Krzywoszynska  2020). Historically, many scientific devel-
opments in the understanding of soil function have shaped 
and been shaped by their implications for agricultural pro-
ductivity and profitability (Foster and Magdoff  1998; 
Mauro  2014; Puig de la Bellacasa  2015). For example, equa-
tions and models describing the kinetics of soil nutrient 
limitation for crop productivity drive particular modes of 
land management and mold conceptions of optimal soil 
function, which can also influence future research foci, pri-
orities, and related policies (Foster and Magdoff  1998; 
Mauro  2014; Puig de la Bellacasa  2015; Krzywoszynska and 
Marchesi  2020; Lyons  2020; Nightingale et al . 2019). 
Recognizing the ways in which these factors have influ-
enced the history and framing of soil science is critical as 
scientists are increasingly called upon to inform climate 
mitigation policies in agriculture. How might our work sup-
port a diversity of soil functions, soil organisms, and 
human–soil relations beyond those deemed economically 
profitable?
Offset markets perpetuate environmental injustice
Coalitions of environmental justice advocates and frontline 
communities have a history of opposing carbon offset mar-
kets, which can allow industries to evade accountability or 
delay reductions in direct emissions based on promised 
benefits elsewhere (ActionAid  2011; CJA and IEN  2017; 
NAACP  2021). For example, the Bali Principles of Climate 
Justice, which was endorsed by a broad coalition of organ-
izations during the 2002 Johannesburg Earth Summit, identify 
“market- based mechanisms” as “false solutions” 
(CorpWatch  2002), and the Indigenous Environmental 4 of 7   CONCEPTS AND QUESTIONS

Keeping offset markets out of soilNetwork’s Principles of Just Transition specifically call for 
the rejection of carbon offset markets (IEN  2023). These 
objections are grounded in part by the experiences of com-
munities located in proximity to polluting facilities. Offset 
sales within compliance markets have led to distributive 
injustices by enabling emissions—including both GHG emis-
sions and harmful air pollutants—to persist or increase 
around vulnerable communities, based on presumed seques-
tration or reductions in emissions elsewhere (Cushing 
et al.  2018; Lejano et al.  2020; Declet- Barreto and 
Rosenberg  2022).
Historically, communities that are most burdened by envi-
ronmental pollution have not benefited from offset market-  
based policies. For instance, in an analysis of the first 2 years of 
California’s Cap and Trade program, Cushing et al .  (2018) 
found that (i) regulated facilities were disproportionately sited 
in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher 
proportions of residents of color; (ii) most of the regulated 
facilities increased emissions of both GHGs and co- pollutants, 
such as nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, 
while participating in the program; and (iii) neighborhoods 
that experienced increases in both annual average GHGs and 
co- pollutants had higher proportions of people of color or 
other demographic factors indicating environmental justice 
concerns. Thus, the use of carbon offsets can allow regulated 
facilities to keep polluting and degrading local air quality by 
funding projects located far away from the source of direct 
emissions without directly benefiting frontline communities.
Enlisting agricultural soils as distant and opaque carbon 
sinks within carbon offset schemes has the potential to exac-
erbate environmental concerns for historically marginalized 
communities impacted directly by sites of extraction and 
emissions. Many social considerations exist around partici-
pation in aggregated offset markets (Barbato and 
Strong  2023), including issues of self- determination, proce-
dural justice, and land rights. Prescribing particular land-  
use strategies based on global budgets and estimates of 
biogeochemical potential has direct implications to 
Indigenous and rural land rights (Bond et al . 2019; 
Nightingale et al. 2019; Newell  2022). These concerns extend 
across both compliance- based and voluntary markets. For 
example, tree- planting programs have targeted land in the 
Global South for afforestation efforts with poor consultation 
of local communities and harmful consequences to 
Indigenous land rights, food security, rural livelihoods, and 
biodiversity (Bond et al . 2019; Fleischman et al . 2020, 2022; 
Fischer et al . 2023). Regardless of improvements in method-
ologies for measuring soil carbon or reductions in uncer -
tainty around the magnitude of potential sequestration in 
soils, scientists and policy makers must seriously consider 
concerns raised by environmental justice advocates and 
frontline communities and recognize that nearly all policies 
related to soil carbon management have implications for 
land rights.Conclusions
Soil scientists are increasingly invited to engage in climate 
policy and market spaces. Often, these engagements are 
focused on providing quantitative estimates for the climate 
mitigation potential of SCS or developing methods to 
quantify carbon stocks for use within offset markets. We 
must recognize that these efforts are deeply intertwined 
with a wide range of issues, including biodiversity, land 
rights, food production, and environmental justice. Scientific 
findings operationalize particular framings of soil health 
and function, build the underlying protocols shaping carbon 
market structures, and are used to inform land- use policies. 
As soil scientists continue their critical research, we invite 
them to oppose the inclusion of soil carbon in offset mar-
kets and to further explore how the use of their work 
upholds or resists systems of fossil- fuel extraction and 
intersects with climate justice.
Strategies to restore the soil carbon debt must not be used 
as an opportunity to greenwash direct emissions. To shape 
climate policy, we urge soil scientists to ensure that any 
efforts to restore soil organic carbon are placed in appropri-
ate context to distinguish between fossil carbon and soil 
organic carbon, and to distinguish between sources of often 
overlapping anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon 
cycle. Soil carbon simply cannot offset fossil- fuel emissions 
due to differences in permanence, existing agricultural cli-
mate impacts, and the interconnectedness of soil with multi-
ple ecosystem functions.
Critically, offset markets raise several environmental justice 
concerns and have been opposed for several decades by front-
line communities. Rather than developing methods to include 
SCS in climate neutrality claims, we invite scientists to draw 
from a long history of advocacy in opposition to offset markets 
to explore opportunities for climate mitigation that seriously 
consider environmental justice. Corporations, organizations, 
and governments must be held accountable to realize absolute 
emissions reductions, and this accountability is not the work of 
environmental justice advocates alone. Soil scientists can 
advocate for shifting efforts from developing offset markets 
toward promoting action on direct emissions reductions, 
including those from land- based sectors. Finally, soil scientists 
can support transitions to systems that support a broader 
diversity of soil functions and honor soil relations beyond 
commodification.
