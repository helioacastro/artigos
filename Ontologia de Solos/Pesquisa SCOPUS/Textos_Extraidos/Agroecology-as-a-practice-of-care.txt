ABSTRACT
This paper speculates on using blockchain and Decentralized Au-
tonomous Organizations (DAOs) in agroecological regeneration,
focusing on the case of Spain’s Mar Menor. It highlights the ecolog-
ical challenges of intensive agriculture, drawing on theories like
Haraway’s cyborg metaphor and Latour’s actor-network theory
to contextualize the crisis within the interplay of human and non-
human actors. The study introduces a conceptual blockchain-based
prototype to automate ecosystem resilience through DAOs that
manage land and agricultural practices. It proposes strategic inter-
ventions such as reforestation with nitrogen-fixing trees, cultivat-
ing flood-resistant crops, and the creation of new agro-settlements.
The paper argues that blockchain technologies can optimize these
strategies by enabling precise monitoring and management, thus
enhancing soil fertility, sustainable agriculture, and community
sustainability. It presents a vision of agroecosystems as resilient,
autonomous entities capable of addressing ecological and economic
challenges.

1 INTRODUCTION
Commodifying human and non-human landscapes through capital-
intensive agricultural production systems marks a critical juncture
in exploiting "ecological surpluses," essential for sustaining the
capitalist accumulation process [ 57]. This issue is particularly pro-
nounced in the agricultural sector, where reliance on non-specialized
immigrant labor becomes indispensable as developed countries
experience accelerated urbanization and demographic shifts. Con-
sequently, rural landscapes and agro-food-related occupations are
increasingly devalued. Drawing on theoretical and methodological
insights from scholars such as Donna Haraway (cyborg metaphor),
Bruno Latour (actor-network theory), and Erik Swyngedouw (anal-
ysis of Spanish hydro-modernity), alongside contributions from
political ecology emphasizing nature’s valuation [ 7,75], this pa-
per situates the Mar Menor within hydro-social landscapes. We
examine the potential contributions of Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations (DAOs) to agroecology [ 45,69,81], exploring how
these technologies can address issues emerging from the confluence
of digital systems of control and historical systems of land, living
beings, and labor control in agriculture [52].
Intensive agricultural practices have led to significant ecological
degradation, exemplified by the eutrophication of the Mar Menor
lagoon in Spain. Traditional top-down control systems in agricul-
ture contribute to this degradation and disenfranchise local farmers.
There is a pressing need for innovative solutions that promote
sustainable practices and empower local communities. By decen-
tralizing governance and management, we posit that DAOs can
offer solutions that empower farmers, promote sustainable prac-
tices, and mitigate the negative impacts of traditional top-down
control systems in the agricultural sector, offering new sociotech-
nical outcomes through design or extravention [21].
Addressing this problem is crucial for advancing sustainable
agricultural practices and mitigating environmental impacts. The
relevance of this issue extends to human-computer interaction
(HCI) as it involves leveraging digital technologies (DLTs) to de-
centralize agricultural governance (DAOs), enhance transparency,
109

and promote equity [ 86]. This aligns with current trends in digital
transformation and sustainability within HCI [8, 21].
1.1 The case of Murcia’s Mar Menor
Murcia, an autonomous community in southeastern Spain, is a
vast irrigation machine operated by farmers, cooperatives, and
increasingly foreign-owned multinationals or supermarket chains.
These entities either cultivate their land or lease from smaller plot
owners, contributing to a sector that has made Southern Spain the
"orchard of Europe," with a profit margin of more than 900 million
euros in the Segura river basin and over 100,000 direct jobs. The
industry depends on the extensive engineering works of the Tagus-
Segura transfer, a significant infrastructure that transports water
from the north to the south. Once a vibrant tourist destination and
a haven for diverse marine life, the Mar Menor lagoon, the largest
hypersaline lagoon in Europe, suffered a severe eutrophication
event in the summer of 2016. This transformed its waters into
a "green soup" of algae, leading to massive fish die-offs and the
destruction of marine habitats. This ecological catastrophe was
primarily attributed to the intensive agricultural practices in the
region (see Fig.1), which have been expanding since the 1960s.
Recently, the Mar Menor has gained growing attention when a
group of environmental activists sought to protect it by changing
its legal status. Following a vigorous campaign by the activist group
ILP Mar Menor, 500,000 signatures were gathered in a petition
calling for the lagoon to be granted legal personhood. The Spanish
Congress of Deputies overwhelmingly approved this legislative
initiative in April 2022, marking the first time a European region is
classified as a legal person with all ensuing rights and protections.
This historic decision means the lagoon is represented by legal
guardians, a monitoring committee of "protectors," and a scientific
advisory board. Additionally, any citizen can file a lawsuit on behalf
of the Mar Menor [62].
1.2 Spain’s cyborg hydro-landscapes
The transformation of Spain’s landscape into a modernized, hy-
draulic society began post-1898, after losing its last overseas colonies
when the country shifted toward internal development. This shift
laid the groundwork for a vision aimed at remaking the national ge-
ography and addressing the dire conditions of rural Spain through
modernization and development initiatives, particularly in hydrol-
ogy and agriculture. Central to this vision was "hydraulic regenera-
tionism," championed by intellectuals and technocrats like Joaquin
Costa. They advocated for creating a new hydraulic geography to
alleviate the arid conditions of the central plains and transform
Spain into fertile land. This ambition led to establishing large-scale
hydro-infrastructures, driven by the Corps of Engineers and marked
by significant public works projects. These projects accelerated dur-
ing the fascist period under Franco’s regime, epitomized by the
Tagus-Segura Water Transfer project, which exemplifies the na-
tion’s efforts to harness water resources to support agriculture and
development.
This intensive cultivation system relies on the hydrological cycle
and a migrant workforce seeking better livability. Over the last 20
years, the area has been supplied with precarious labor through a
series of temporary migration programs (TMPs), combined withthe employment of irregular workers and, more recently, with the
rise of "private" programs run by local companies [56].

Cartagena around Mar Menor with and without the irrigated
land.
Our work uniquely contributes to the HCI field by integrating
DAOs and DLTs into the discourse on sustainable agriculture [ 21,
52]. We provide new empirical insights into how these technologies
can decentralize control, foster community-based decision-making,
and enhance transparency and traceability in the agricultural value
chain [ 45,69,81,86]. This study advances current knowledge on
the intersection of digital technologies and agroecology, offering
speculative applications for enhancing sustainability and equity in
agricultural practices.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
The intersection of human and non-human entities in the pursuit
of sustainable ecosystems has become an increasingly prominent
theme in contemporary research [ 1,17,18,31]. The increasing
awareness of global ecological and climate crises has catalyzed calls
for a fundamental shift in the core principles across various disci-
plines. Scholars have pointed out the shortcomings of anthropocen-
trism in addressing these challenges, advocating for a reevaluation
of human-centered perspectives in philosophy, architecture, design,
and science and technology studies [ 24–26,30,47,54,55]. Over
the last four decades, theoretical frameworks that challenge the
primacy of humans have emerged: Isabelle Stengers critiques the
notion of a disenchanted modernity and promotes a more entangled
understanding of science, nature, and society [ 77]; Donna Haraway
discusses the interconnectedness of humans and non-humans, chal-
lenging anthropocentrism [ 35,36]; Karan Barad introduces "agen-
tial realism," which emphasizes the interactivity between human
and non-human actors [ 6]; Michel Serres argues against the di-
chotomy of natural and cultural realms, advocating for a collabora-
tive approach with nature [ 71]; and Bruno Latour highlights the
critical need to integrate nature into political discourses, suggesting
nature be regarded as a political entity[48–50].
In the following subsections we present and discuss related work
on more-than-human perspectives in HCI, capitalism and techno-
centrism and decentralized technologies for enviromental manage-
ment and agroecology.

2.1 More-Than-Human Perspectives in HCI
This paradigm shift is also evident in Human-Computer Interac-
tion (HCI), where there is a growing recognition of the importance
of adopting more-than-human perspectives [ 17]. Scholars are in-
creasingly challenging anthropocentric design and research stances,
promoting sustainable and responsible approaches that envisage
futures inclusive of both human and non-human well-being. For
instance, Romani and colleagues introduce a "provotype" that en-
hances collaboration between human and non-human entities, aim-
ing to rethink design contributions to sustainable futures [ 68]. Rice
emphasizes the influential role of non-humans in shaping partici-
patory design processes, enhancing the democratic nature of these
interactions and advocating for a shift from traditional, rational-
ist design paradigms to those that prioritize relational dynamics
[63]. However, Sheikh and colleagues point out that “smart city”
thinking and practice, driven by technocratic approaches, are actu-
ally reinforcing human exceptionalism [ 73]. Their work critically
reviews technocratic approaches to smart urban governance and
offers alternatives on how digital technologies and politics can be
reconfigured to care for the more-than-human world. A similar
approach is described by Heitlinger et al. critiquing the global in-
dustrial food system, primarily driven by human-centered values
and the commodification of food, leading to significant social and
environmental inequalities [ 37]. The research highlights the poten-
tial of blockchain technology to foster new forms of value exchange
and governance. The team engaged with urban agricultural commu-
nities through roleplay to co-design blockchain-enabled visions of
food systems that could support a thriving multispecies food com-
mons. Their project aimed to redefine algorithmic food justice by
emphasizing more-than-human values and reconceptualizing food
as a commons shared among various species. The study addresses
several challenges and tensions that emerged during these innova-
tive explorations, and the authors admitted in a later publication
that the prototyping sessions did not produce a coherent narrative
in the ways they’d hoped for, namely because of the impossibil-
ity of speaking for or standing in for more-than-human species
[40]. Despite the material shortcomings of this project, we see the
conceptual value in tinkering with the possibility of imagining
more-than-human relations through a lens of ecological repara-
tion. There is an abundance of technologies out there claiming to
innovate the food sector; very few projects however, transition
from extractive ontologies to multispecies futures, and these are
precisely the ideas we need in times of ecological collapse.
2.2 Decentralized Technologies for
Environmental Management
Decentralized technologies like blockchain and DAOs could signifi-
cantly enhance the management of complex environmental issues,
such as those faced in the Mar Menor lagoon watershed. In light
of the historical patterns of agricultural technology and racialized
land dispossession in the United States, Liu and Sengers examined
the historical systems of control of land, living beings, and labor
at work in agriculture at the confluence of digital systems [ 52].
They argue that legibility, the organizing principle in the design
of digital agriculture systems, uses simplified understandings to
control and direct action, often obscuring complex realities andreinforcing existing power dynamics[ 52,53]. It is essential to con-
sider how DAOs and DLTs might reproduce or challenge these
legacies. This raises critical questions about what is made legible
through these technologies and what remains hidden or illegible,
particularly concerning who can participate in and benefit from
agricultural innovations.
By leveraging the principles of sociomateriality[ 60], distributed
ledger technologies (DLTs) and DAOs in particular can address key
challenges in agroecology, such as improving production sustain-
ability, enhancing farmer collaboration, and ensuring transparent
governance of agricultural resources[ 8,51,86]. This alignment with
sociomateriality theory underscores the transformative potential
of DAOs in creating more robust and adaptive agricultural sys-
tems that benefit both human and technological actors[ 45,86]. For
instance, blockchain could provide an immutable ledger for trans-
parently tracking pollution sources and remedial measures. At the
same time, DAOs could democratize decision-making, allowing
stakeholders, including local communities, experts, and govern-
ment bodies, to collaboratively vote on and implement resource
management and regulatory decisions[ 69]. These technologies en-
sure accountability and efficient resource allocation, facilitating the
adoption of agroecology on a regional scale and creating a robust
framework for sustainable management, potentially serving as a
model for similar ecological challenges worldwide. Some research
projects are considering addressing the potential of DAOs and DLTs
in support of environmental issues [59, 72].
Critically, while these studies provide valuable insights, some
scholars argue that they neglect the interplay between capital-
ism and ecological crises, often halting at speculative stages with-
out pushing for deeper, systemic change [ 14,22]. Indeed, while
digital technologies are often critiqued for exacerbating capitalist
and technocentric issues [ 37,73], they hold the potential to alter
our engagement with the environment and other species substan-
tially [ 74]. The persistent focus on efficiency, productivity, and
consumerism in tech-driven solutions can sideline more integral,
holistic approaches to sustainability that include non-human enti-
ties. To harness these technologies for the betterment of broader
ecological systems, there must be a deliberate pivot towards frame-
works prioritizing long-term ecological health and resilience rather
than short-term human-centered gains. Recent evaluations by Scuri
and colleagues sustain this [ 70] suggestion that while sustainable
HCI has focused on environmental and societal aspects, it often
overlooks economic considerations, which are crucial for achieving
a balanced and inclusive approach to sustainability.
2.3 Critiques of Blockchain and Technological
Imperialism
Despite the potential benefits of blockchain technology, several
critiques highlight its ethical and political issues [ 79]. Jutel argues
that blockchain humanitarianism often serves as a public-relations
function for the broader crypto-economy, perpetuating colonial
legacies of experimentation in developing countries [ 42]. This ap-
proach, termed crypto-colonialism, aligns with Silicon Valley’s
cultural values and promotes technological abstraction that under-
mines developing world sovereignty [ 43]. The ethical failings of
blockchain projects are attributed to the inability to operate outside
111
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Inglezaki et al.
the solutionist PR machinery, and the inherent obscurantism of
technology [ 43], which contributes to new socio-technical assem-
blages emerging as complex predatory formations of speculation
that are intentionally obfuscatory and difficult to regulate [ 19]. The
Ethereum blockchain is an example of negative criticism on DAOs
after a major scam that occurred a few weeks after it was first
launched in 2016. Ethereum was the first permissionless network to
offer smart contracts which is why there was so much excitement
among the Ethereum community over the DAO. Soon after, mali-
cious agents took advantage of a weakness in the smart contract
code to pull almost 40% of the overall funds. The decentralized
nature of the project made it impossible for a central controller to
cancel the transaction, and so the core Ether developers had to make
the choice of pulling a hard fork and rewriting transactions on the
blockchain in order to return the funds, essentially compromising
the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain. Given the novelty
of smart contracts and their technical tools, failures are inevitable
and when those failures occur on non-upgradeable smart contracts,
there may be no solution other than a disruptive fork [82].
3 CAPITALISM, TECHNOCENTRISM, AND
ECOLOGICAL CRISES
In the capitalist agro-economy, both human bodies and natural
resources are commodified, reducing their value to mere labor or
utility, with female bodies often subjected to further degradation
through sexualization. In a recent feature on migrant seasonal work-
ers in Spain in The Funambulist, anthropologist Salma Amazian
explained how race, class, and gender are interwoven in the modern
colonial order, stating that "when Moroccan women are displaced to
Spain, they remain subject to a colonial relationship of domination
that draws on a legacy based on economic extractivism... today the
merchandise is the bodies, to use them for the jobs the Spanish
don’t want to do" [ 61]. The human body is stripped of its rights and
ethical value and reduced to its labor capacity like the river has lost
its pre-Western thinking sanctity. If the body is female, it becomes
automatically sexualized and is viewed as a private satisfaction
and utility-maximizing machine[ 34]. The migrant body doesn’t age,
tire, endure the sun’s cruelty, and satisfy its owner as he pleases.
This bodily productivity creates economic value and constitutes
biocapital.
This perspective calls for reevaluating labor’s value, emphasiz-
ing recognizing and regenerating undervalued or unpaid work as
crucial human capital. The interconnectedness of local and global,
human and non-human elements in the journey of a product, like a
Murcian tomato in a German supermarket, illustrates the complex
networks and socio-ecological processes at play (see Fig. 2). This
web of interactions encompasses everything from social hierarchies
and environmental transformations to global hydrological cycles
and geopolitical struggles, underlining the active role of material
objects and bodies within these networks, as described by thinkers
like Latour and Swyngedouw [48, 78].
3.1 The Mar Menor Lagoon Watershed
In the Mar Menor lagoon watershed case, the current discourse
revolves mainly around techno-engineered solutions for managing
nitrate leaks like the project RemediOS by Hernandis and colleagues,within the framework of the Mar Menor Oyster Initiative, which
introduces sixty million oysters in the lagoon to filter the nitrates in
the polluted water [ 38] or the development of an environmentally-
friendly fertilizer based on natural zeolites (porous volcanic rocks)
led by ASAJA, the Young Farmers Agrarian Association of Murcia,
that aspires to halt chemical pollution[ 58]. While many studies shed
light on the hydrogeological configuration of the underlying Campo
de Cartagena aquifer and reveal the catastrophic consequences of
years of overexploitation on the aquifer [ 66], there seems to be
a knowledge gap in developing holistic strategies for the regen-
eration of the agricultural landscape that is the main driver of
pollution. The ecological crisis of Mar Menor has been character-
ized as a wicked problem because of the multitude of stakeholders
involved in its socio-ecological system and their conflicting val-
ues. Boix-Fayos and colleagues conducted a content analysis of the
stakeholders’ values and proposed a new framework for finding
common grounds for conflict resolution among the involved ac-
tors [ 11]. Nature-based solutions (Nbs) are an emerging alternative
in urban planning and landscape architecture that use green-blue
infrastructures as opposed to traditional grey infrastructures and
provide environmental, social, and economic benefits. A recent
study by García-Ayllón proposes Nbs as risk mitigation actions for
the Mar Menor region based on geostatistical indicators, namely
permeable pavements, infiltration ditches, floodable bioretention
beds, and retention ponds [ 29]. However, such proposals have not
yet been part of a regional planning strategy that should utilize
them on a territorial scale and synergistically implement them
within a socio-agroecological context.
Working through the lens of the Mar Menor as a techno-social
cyborg entity, we understand the lagoon as an engine of the Anthro-
pocene. From intense modes of production to worsening climate
conditions, engineered topographies, contamination from toxic
microorganisms, and marginalized people out of sight and out of
mind, the entanglement of these processes situates Mar Menor in
our new geological epoch. While the term Anthropocene has be-
come a culprit for all humanity, posthumanist theories provoke
a reexamination of how human cultures appropriate their territo-
ries. Extending the cyborg metaphor to a planetary scale, Collins
proposes CyberGaia to describe our biosphere in a way that ac-
knowledges human technology as an integral part of nature [ 15].
The CyberGaia concept concedes the power of technology over
the natural world but goes deeper in seeing technology as nature,
embedded in nature’s cybernetics networks. And while the An-
thropocene doesn’t “take place” here, or there, some places leave
their material mark as a manifestation of our era. All day and all
night, the soil and its biotic elements, the water cycle and the sun-
beams, and the hands and the bodies of some “others” tirelessly
produce edible commodities that are processed, packaged, exported,
and shipped over the world, creating a deep physical and cultural
separation between people and place.
3.2 The Production of Nature through an
Actor-Network Theory (ANT) Approach
The narrative of the Spanish hydro-social landscapes that have
altered the ecosystems of Mar Menor leads us to view the lagoon as
112
Agroecology as a Practice of Care supported by Blockchain and DAOs Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
Figure 2: Visible and invisible infrastructures that compose
Campo de Cartagena
an assemblage of human, non-human, chemical, biological, mate-
rial, theoretical, organic, and mechanical processes, but ultimately
political. The political drive to establish a robust economic sector in
the countryside, defying the material limitations of the land, turns
the social into nature and nature into capital. The thousands of
processes that sustain the Murcian economy, and any peri-urban
economy, blend society and nature into a cyborg entity where the
boundary between human and animal is transgressed [34].
The protagonists of Spain’s modernity and hydrology are people
because social science follows a divide between human and non-
human agency. Human agency is central, and the rest of the world
is offered for action. However, the chain of events leading to the
ecological disaster of Mar Menor resists conventional social expla-
nations precisely because of the plethora of non-human agents. The
hydraulic force of the Tagus River, the immense work of the Tagus-
Segura transfer, the orchards of Murcia, the chemical properties of
nitrates, the cross-contamination of aquifers, the asphyxiation of
marine species, and the explosive growth of algae (see Fig.2) shape
social processes, sometimes according to human rationality and
planning, and sometimes not.
The material processes of the lagoon and the techno-natural
infrastructures of the Iberian waters create cyborgs and hybrids.
Efforts to tame and transform the hydrological cycle, engineer
the land, and control nature are only partially successful. Water
bodies get contaminated, dams fail, and ecological relations become
unbalanced, with significant consequences for the social networks
that rely on them. Building on ANT as the theoretical foundation
of this study, we understand that the material agency of water,
shifting through local, national, and global scales, assembles a new
techno-natural “imbroglio” embedded in ecological urgency (see
Fig. 3).Material objects and bodies become actors with their own con-
sciousness, as Langdon Winner describes the development of the
mechanical tomato harvester introduced in the US in the late 1940s.
This machine replaced handpicking and reduced costs, but re-
searchers bred new varieties of tomatoes that were hardier, sturdier,
and less tasty to fit the machine’s requirements [ 85]. The design
of any given technology marks a social choice of how people will
work, communicate, travel, consume, and so on [ 85], leaving no
room for innocence in the products we consume, the technological
artifacts we use, or the information we process.

3.3 Distributed Ledger Technologies and DAOs
in Support of Agro-ecological Regeneration
Digital agriculture systems are increasingly employed to boost pro-
ductivity and reduce environmental impact through automated,
data-driven decision-making processes. However, these systems
often perpetuate historical legacies of control and simplification,
resulting in unintended consequences such as increased labor gov-
ernance, surveillance, and brittleness in farming practices [52].
Actor-Network Theory (ANT) provides a sociotechnical per-
spective to analyze complex interactions between technology and
human processes, treating human and non-human actors equally
[49]. As a theoretical basis, ANT is widely applied in computing
research and is thus applicable to the context of Distributed Ledger
Technologies (DLTs) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
(DAOs). These technologies are increasingly recognized for their
potential to drive agroecological regeneration practices by enhanc-
ing inclusivity, efficiency, and sustainability within agricultural
value chains [ 51]. The secure, transparent, and immutable nature
of blockchain and DLTs fosters trust and transparency, improving
traceability “from farm to fork, ” as evidenced by various studies and
initiatives [ 12,23,51,80]. For instance, they enable precise track-
ing of food products through smart contracts and permissioned
ledgers, offering substantial economic advantages, particularly to
small-scale farmers and marginalized communities in developing
regions [45, 80].
113
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Inglezaki et al.
Additionally, DLTs provide a robust mechanism for registering
assets like land titles on the blockchain, overcoming the inefficien-
cies and susceptibility to fraud of traditional land registry systems
[2]. This enhances land ownership verification and enables farmers
to leverage their land as collateral for financing [ 23]. In governance
and ecosystem management, DAOs represent a transformative ap-
proach [ 69]. They automate governance and operational processes
within agroecological systems governed by pre-set rules. A notable
example is Terra0, an artistic prototype developed on the Ethereum
network, which speculates about the potential implementation of
DAOs to underpin technologically enhanced ecosystems capable of
autonomous economic actions, contributing to their resilience and
sustainability [69].
This decentralized approach can empower farmers by giving
them more autonomy and reducing reliance on top-down models
that have historically marginalized certain groups and reinforced
inequitable practices. By integrating blockchain technology with
agroecology, we can create more resilient and equitable agricultural
systems that support sustainable practices and community-based
decision-making, addressing both socio-economic and environmen-
tal challenges in the agricultural sector.
The concept of sociomateriality, which examines the entangle-
ment between the social and the material in organizational life,
provides a valuable framework for understanding the integration
of DAOs in agriculture [ 51]. Sociomateriality focuses on how hu-
man and technological elements are intertwined and shape each
other [ 60]. In the context of DAOs, this perspective highlights the
conjoined agency of humans and machines, where advanced infor-
mation technologies like blockchain and AI transform traditional
agricultural practices and organizational structures [ 69]. DAOs,
through their decentralized and automated nature, embody this
sociomaterial entanglement, offering new ways to manage and
govern agricultural ecosystems that are both efficient and resilient
[69].
4 AGROECOLOGY AS A PRACTICE OF CARE
Agroecology is at once a scientific discipline, a movement and a
practice [ 83]. The term "agroecology" emerged at the beginning
of last century in the scientific publications of Basil M. Benzin [ 9],
a Russian agronomist who used the term to describe the use of
ecological methods in research on commercial crop plants. In the
following years many related publications were produced with-
out the use of agroecology in the title and instead they referred
to agricultural zoology [ 27], ecology, and crop physiology [ 46].
Through the 1960s and 1970s the Green Revolution enabled a great
increase in the production of food grains around the world and
created greater intensification of production. At the same time,
public awareness on the impact of human intervention over nature
started coming to the fore after Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring set
the foundations of modern ecology with her meticulous descrip-
tion of how DDT, the most powerful pesticide the world had ever
known, entered the food chain and accumulated in the fatty tissues
of animals, including human beings, and caused cancer and genetic
damage[ 13]. It wasn’t until the 1980s that agroecology emerged as
a practice with its own distinct conceptual framework and guide-
lines to design and manage sustainable agroecosystems [ 3]. Fourmain properties of agroecosystems were developed by Conway
[16]: productivity, stability, sustainability and equity. As theories
of sustainability and ecology were further explored, agroecology
started gaining ground as a scientific discipline and moved from
focusing on individual agroecosystems to a wider focus on the food
system, defined as a global network of food production, distribution
and consumption [ 32]. Agroecology has grown into a transdisci-
plinary field that includes the ecological socio-cultural, economic,
and political dimensions of agro-systems, from production to the
very consumption. Systems-thinking through holistic approaches
is needed to address the complex interdependencies that derive
from human activities in natural terrestrial ecosystems.
Depending on the context, agroecological studies might still fo-
cus on the agroecosystem scale. Rural landscapes can be divided
into observable and measurable units based on agroecosystem age,
management purposes, economic need, or land use compatibility.
Productive units are divided into plots and agroecosystems, which
can be the same or vastly different. The plot is essentially a man-
agement unit and the agroecosystem contains sets of plants serving
a certain purpose. Plots are areas demarcated by either constructed
boundaries (fences and hedges) or natural (streams, hills, etc.). A
plot can consist of a single agroecosystem or a group of agroe-
cosystems that perform a common function within the limits of
the demarcated area. The agroecosystem is the central unit in any
given landscape and is defined by its design role since all compo-
nent plants are used to achieve a set of objectives (production, water
retention, erosion control, etc.). The aim of our project, however,
is to see agroecology as a holistic and integrated approach while
applying both ecological and social concepts to the design and
management of sustainable food systems. A system’s optimization
cannot be viable without taking into account the need for socially
equitable conditions within which people can choose what they
cultivate, how much, and how it is produced. The intrinsic relation-
ship between people and the planet, and in particular the role of
food systems, is at the basis of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. Providing food security (SDG number number 2) and
ending poverty (SDG number 1) while responsibly managing the
available natural resources are pillars of sustainability and can only
be feasible through holistic approaches that comply with human
rights.
Contemporary theories of ecology and posthumanism enforced
by feminist theories are calling for a shift from extractive practices
to regenerative alternatives of human and natural work through
the notion of care. The work of Maria Puig de la Bellacasa and her
matters of care is the most notable example of ethico-political recon-
figurations of ecological relations. De la Bellacasa disrupts visions
of innovation in technoscience through practices of “maintenance”
and “repair”. Care work becomes better when it is done again and
again, as an everyday mundane, repetitive work[ 20]. The ecological
turn is also part of soil science which in recent years has introduced
the notion of "living soil", meaning that soil is not just a habitat
for plants and organisms but it can only exist with and through
a multispecies community biota that makes it. Such soil-friendly
care practices are embedded in permaculture, an agroecological
movement which is defined as "consciously designed landscapes
which mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, while
yielding an abundance of food, fibre and energy for provision of
114
Agroecology as a Practice of Care supported by Blockchain and DAOs Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
local needs[ 39]. Although being an international movement with
a great number of practitioners, it has not been discussed widely
in the scientific literature. Permaculture has become the founda-
tion of many successful community-based projects for neglected
communities, meaning, populations that systematically do not re-
ceive enough services from the government and are susceptible to
diseases and water pollution due to waste and organic residues[ 5].
One such example is the Bucket Revolution Project (BRP) in the
region of Florianópolis in Brazil. The Comunidade Chico Mendes is
one of the most vulnerable communities in the region and has dealt
with poor management of organic waste and infestations of rats,
cockroaches, mosquitos, and other disease vectors. The initiative
of local actors to discuss urban agriculture in schools and among
communities attracted 95 families taking part in the project already
six months after it started [ 28]. By implementing permaculture
principles they engaged in composting practices by turning food
“waste” into compost, transforming the organic residues into pre-
cious nutrients back to the soil. The basic mechanism of the project
is based on the distribution of buckets to the families living in the
community which they filled with household organic waste and
then brought them to the “ponto de entrega voluntária”, the site for
collecting the organic waste[67].
4.1 A speculative future for the Campo de
Cartagena territory
Since farming is a primary economic activity in the entirety of the
region of Murcia and there is already a great investment interest
in the land, the strategies presented here are working in line with
this fact, attempting to restructure the kinds of cultivation and
export as a means to moderate the existing intensive models and
to pay respect to the natural systems they are based on. To develop
the design strategies, the factors that have been used as a design
framework are mainly the climatological classification of the re-
gion, the extent of the floodplain and its annual cycles, the zones
of high nitrate concentration, and the orchards that are mainly
producing this pollution. The first strategy entails reforestation
with nitrogen-fixing trees and nitrogen management practices. Ni-
trogen (N) is considered one of the most essential elements for the
growth of plants and can significantly benefit agriculture. Nitrogen
fertilizers are responsible for feeding approximately 48 percent of
the global population [ 64] but a large part of them is lost to the
environment because nitrogen is a very mobile nutrient. Nitrogen
can be transferred to the atmosphere, in the form of N2O, N2, and
NH3 and can become a pollutant in surface waterways in the form
of nitrate, encouraging eutrophication processes that result in a loss
of biodiversity and loss in water quality, and in aquifers[ 33] as in
the case of Mar Menor. Spanish agriculture is characterized by high
inputs of fertilizers and high nutrient emissions to the environment
[33], posing a threat to water quality, therefore it is imperative to
manage the N cycle to prevent nitrate leaks.
Using organic and mineral fertilizers has successfully reduced
N losses, improved N use efficiency (NUE), and reduced N surplus.
N surplus is the difference between field N input and output. N
surplus has been suggested as an indicator of the potential loss of
N to the environment [39]. Besides N surplus, several crop and soil
management practices can influence the N losses. Various species oflegumes have been observed for their beneficial effects in agronomic
systems. These legumes form symbiotic associations with bacteria
called rhizobia which fix atmospheric N into biologically useful
forms [ 41] (see Fig.4). In intercropping systems where legumes are
the main component, the main sources of nitrogen are the atmo-
spheric nitrogen fixed by the legume, the nitrogen available from
the soil in organic or inorganic form, and the nitrogen contained in
applied fertilizers. Nitrogen loss occurs through harvested material,
principally seed, and denitrification, leaching, and volatilization. By
and large, intercropping with a legume will maintain the system in
a positive nitrogen balance and if there has been good growth of the
legume, the nitrogen contribution can be significant. Intercropping
is the cultivation of two or more crop species in the same field for
the whole or a part of their growing period [ 41]. It contributes to
high yields and high land use efficiency due to complementarity in
resource requirements between plant species [ 87]. Intercropping
legumes in fruit orchards is a method of sustainable land inten-
sification providing a second crop in the alleys between the fruit
trees[10].
Figure 4: Schematic section of how intercropping legumes
with fruit trees can improve the nitrogen cycle.
The second strategy introduces potential crops for production in
flood-risk areas. The main crops suggested here comprise a tuber
(taro), grasses (aleman grass, flood-tolerant sugarcane, and rice).
Flooded biomass crops have a potential for production in large
areas and can be distributed in large markets throughout Europe,
given the proper economic conditions. The crops that are proposed
here vary widely in yield and nutrient uptake. Rice, for example,
can only thrive in low phosphorus conditions, whereas aleman
grass may require additional phosphorus mineralization. Crops
that thrive in oligotrophic conditions and those requiring large
amounts of nutrients can be significantly useful in water quality
management. Aleman grass can effectively reduce the phosphorus
115
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Inglezaki et al.
content from previously cultivated fields with crops that left behind
large concentrations of chemicals (such as vegetables and fruits).
Rice is also proven to decrease the chemical contents to levels of
natural conditions. What is also important here is the low operating
cost of such cultivations since periodic flooding helps with pest
control [76].
•Sugarcane (Sacchantm spp. and related genera) are grasses
that yield large amounts of biomass. In addition, their high
sucrose content may facilitate a more rapid and economical
conversion of biomass to other forms of fuel. Several acces-
sions of the Saccharurn complex are well adapted to riparian
habitat.
•Taro is a commercially important root crop in many parts of
the world, including Egypt, the Philippines, the South Pacific,
and Hawaii, which grows well under flooded conditions. One
of the major expenses of taro production is weed control,
which can account for as much as 47% of total production
costs. Lowland cultivars would presumably have fewer weed
and insect problems because of flooding [76].
•Alemangrass is an aquatic perennial that is used for grazing,
silage, and hay, mainly in South America. It is adapted to
infertile soil but responds well to nitrogen. It is a deep-water
plant, tolerating floods up to 1 m in depth for short periods
[84]. Indications are that two or three harvests per year
result in greater yields than a single harvest at season’s end.
Alemangrass, because of its greater biomass yield per hectare,
has far greater energy potential than the other crops of the
proposal. However, sugarcane and taro have higher rates
of biomass conversion than alemangrass. The energy value
of a crop of alemangrass is estimated to be 350 MJ ha-1 of
total yield, and 70 Mg ha-1 yield from two harvests per year).
The energy value of taro tops is estimated to be 145 MJ ha-l
of total yield, and 1’45 Mg ha-1 yield from three harvests
per year). Methane production of flood-tolerant sugarcane
ranges from 22 to 330 MJ ha-1 [44].
•Rice is an important crop worldwide. Rice production bene-
fits the soil by reducing the rate of soil loss, and may improve
yields and water quality when grown in rotation with other
crops. In addition, the demand for water from rice planted
in the spring coincides more closely with the rainy season
than other crops in the region. It has also been suggested
that rice grown in rotation with vegetables may improve the
water quality of vegetable drainage [4].
The third strategy introduces new agro-settlements. The strate-
gic locations for new settlement insertions have been chosen based
on existing urbanization patterns and transportation connections.
The logic of the strategy aims to create semi-autonomous settle-
ments in close connection to existing urban areas to accomplish
the social integration of the migrant communities and reverse the
currently segregated status quo. The agro-settlement acts as a cul-
tural repository, preserving knowledge and restoring the depleted
rural lands to build healthy communities. Social interactions are
cultivated on three different scales: i) individual - residents culti-
vate their plots to supply their food; ii) household - groups of 8
households share the responsibility for the maintenance of common
productive land; ii) neighborhood - communities come together
Figure 5: Phasing of the project implementation process.
to manage, harvest, and process the crops. Each new settlement
develops along a central transportation axis between two existing
urban areas. At the very core is a central square with a commer-
cial center; around the various housing typologies unfold about
smaller public spaces and at the edges of the settlement we can find
manufacturing and processing facilities.
4.2 Blockchain Technologies for
Agro-ecological Support
Digital technologies support innovative agroecological interven-
tions, such as reforestation with nitrogen-fixing trees, introducing
potential crops for flood-risk areas, and establishing new agro-
settlements. AI can analyze satellite imagery and drone data to
identify optimal reforestation areas by considering soil type, ni-
trate concentration, and existing vegetation. Machine learning algo-
rithms can predict the impact of different species of nitrogen-fixing
trees on local ecosystems, optimizing the selection and planting pro-
cess to maximize nitrogen fixation and minimize adverse ecological
impacts. DLTs ensure transparency and traceability of renatural-
ization processes, enabling stakeholders to monitor plants’ origins,
growth, and health. DAOs can create technologically augmented,
more resilient ecosystems and operate within a predetermined set
of rules in the economic sphere as agents. According to several au-
thors, while theoretically promising, blockchain technology faces
significant implementation challenges. In the case of cooperative
agroecological supermarkets, despite blockchain’s potential for
116
Agroecology as a Practice of Care supported by Blockchain and DAOs Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
transparency, traceability, and trust, the high costs and complexity
of integration and the lack of technical expertise and regulatory
frameworks have often proved insurmountable [ 65]. Despite these
challenges, the proposed strategies remain viable. For reforestation
with nitrogen-fixing trees, DAOs could automate the monitoring
and managing these trees, tracking their growth and nitrogen-
fixation rates and adjusting planting strategies based on real-time
data. Intelligent contracts could trigger actions based on specific
ecological indicators, ensuring that reforestation reduces nitrogen
surplus and enhances soil fertility [ 8].For crops in flood-risk areas,
DAOs could manage distribution and cultivation across identified
regions. Leveraging the DAO’s capabilities could facilitate resource
allocation, monitor flood patterns, and optimize crop rotations and
planting schedules to maximize yield while minimizing environ-
mental impact. Smart contracts could automatically adjust crop
choices and management practices in response to changing flood
risks and water quality data, ensuring sustainable agricultural pro-
duction [8, 65]. In establishing new agro-settlements, DAOs could
integrate these settlements within a decentralized network manag-
ing production, resource allocation, and social integration efforts.
Smart contracts could enforce agreements regarding land use, crop
selection, and resource sharing, fostering cooperative management
and ensuring these settlements’ social and ecological sustainabil-
ity. DLTs acting as agents within economic spheres could support
financial viability by automating transactions, such as the sale of
produce or profit distribution among community members, enhanc-
ing resilience and autonomy [ 8,65]. While the past years have
shown that blockchain development faces material and financial
challenges, the potential for innovative agroecological interven-
tions remains significant. By learning from previous projects and
addressing scalability and regulatory issues, blockchain solutions
can still be realized to support sustainable and resilient agricul-
tural practices. As highlighted by Rocas-Royo, the key is to focus
on practical applications and incremental adoption, ensuring that
technological solutions align with the organizational capabilities
and socio-economic contexts of agroecological initiatives [8, 65].
4.3 A Provotype DAO in Support of
Agro-ecological Regeneration
4.3.1 DAO Structure and Objective. Purpose: The primary aim
of the DAO would be to regenerate and preserve the ecological
balance of the Mar Menor lagoon. Stakeholders: Include local
farmers, environmental NGOs, government bodies, researchers,
and local communities. Governance: Token-based voting system
where decisions are made based on stakeholder consensus. Different
tokens might represent different groups (e.g., farmers, researchers,
etc.) to balance influence, ensuring that diverse voices are heard
and reducing the risk of dominance by any single group [52, 69].
4.3.2 Smart Contract Applications. Resource Management Con-
tracts: Automate the allocation and monitoring of water resources
to optimize usage and reduce excessive nutrient loading, which
leads to eutrophication. By using immutable ledgers, transparency
and accountability are ensured [ 45,86].Subsidy Distribution:
To minimize runoff, distribute subsidies or financial incentives to
farmers who adopt sustainable practices such as reduced chemical
usage, cover cropping, and buffer strips. Compliance Monitoring:Implement contracts that automatically monitor and report data
from IoT devices or sensors placed in agricultural areas to ensure
compliance with environmental standards. This addresses the need
for reliable and real-time data to make informed decisions [ 60].
Ecological Impact Credits: Create a system of ecological impact
credits where businesses and tourists can purchase credits. The
funds from these credits would be used for conservation activities,
and the credits themselves could be traded or sold, creating an
economic incentive for ecological preservation.
4.3.3 Technology Integration. IoT Integration: Use IoT sensors
to collect real-time data on water quality, soil moisture, and nu-
trient levels. This data would feed into smart contracts to enforce
or adjust practices quickly, ensuring adaptive management of re-
sources [ 51,86].Blockchain for Transparency: Use blockchain
technology to ensure that all transactions, data logs, and decisions
are recorded permanently and transparently, making it difficult
to tamper with data or misrepresent compliance, fostering trust
among stakeholders [42, 43].
4.3.4 Challenges and Considerations. Technical Complexity: Man-
aging the integration of diverse technologies (IoT, blockchain, smart
contracts) and ensuring they work seamlessly across different actors
requires substantial technical expertise and coordination. Stake-
holder Buy-in: Ensuring that all relevant parties are on board
and understand the benefits and workings of the DAO, which re-
quires extensive education and possibly demonstration projects
to showcase the DAO’s potential and functionality. Legal and
Regulatory Compliance: Aligning the DAO’s operations with
local and national laws might involve navigating complex regula-
tory environments. Proactive engagement with regulatory bodies
can help in crafting compliant frameworks [ 43].Initial Funding:
Could be sought from environmental grants, governmental sup-
port, or crowdfunding within the crypto-community. Emphasizing
the DAO’s potential for positive environmental impact can attract
diverse funding sources. Continual Operation: Transaction fees
within the DAO or voluntary contributions from stakeholders (like
tourism operators who benefit from a clean and vibrant ecosys-
tem) could support ongoing operations. Establishing a sustainable
financial model is essential for long-term success.
4.3.5 Addressing Critiques. Critiques highlight that blockchain
projects often face ethical and political issues, such as perpetuating
colonial legacies and technological abstraction that undermines lo-
cal sovereignty [ 42,43]. To counter these critiques the development
of the DAO should follow:
•Inclusive Design: Ensure that the DAO is designed with
input from local communities to avoid imposing external
solutions and to respect local knowledge and practices.
•Transparent Communication: Maintain open and trans-
parent communication channels with all stakeholders to
build trust and ensure mutual understanding.
•Ethical Framework: Develop and adhere to an ethical
framework that prioritizes the needs and rights of local com-
munities, ensuring that technological interventions do not
exacerbate existing inequalities [19].
By addressing these challenges and critiques proactively, the pro-
posed DAO can serve as a robust model for sustainable management
117

and agro-ecological regeneration, potentially offering solutions to
similar ecological challenges worldwide.
5 CONCLUSION
This paper has navigated the intricate landscape of agroecological
regeneration, emphasizing the critical intersections where human
and non-human actors converge within the hydro-social context of
Murcia’s Mar Menor. By employing theoretical frameworks such as
cyborg theory, actor-network theory, and political ecology, we have
examined the intertwined dynamics of agricultural commodifica-
tion, ecological degradation, technocentrism, and the socio-political
forces at play. The case of Mar Menor underscores the detrimental
impacts of intensive agricultural practices and the pressing need
for sustainable alternatives that prioritize ecological health and re-
silience. The proposed speculative spatial strategies for the Campo
de Cartagena territory represent a holistic approach to agroecolog-
ical regeneration, integrating traditional knowledge with advanced
technologies to restore ecological balance and promote social equity.
Restoring the nitrogen cycle is crucial for the ecological balance
of any agroecosystem and can be easily applied by utilizing inter-
cropping practices in the right combinations of crops. Mitigating
floods in high-risk areas by making use of the floodplain to cultivate
flood-tolerant crops such as taro, aleman grass, rice, and sugarcane
can relief the territory greatly of the increased pressure it has been
receiving in the last decades with high torrential rains that are
mainly transported through the Rambla del Albujón canal. Lastly,
constructing new settlements to house agricultural workers can
act as a cultural repository of agroecology, preserving knowledge
and building a closer bond between people and the land while
providing the right to housing for migrant communities. These
strategies, informed by blockchain and DAOs’ potential, serve as
a blueprint for reimagining agricultural landscapes as spaces of
care, cooperation, and sustainable production. In exploring DLTs
and DAOs conceptually, we have identified potential pathways for
enhancing inclusivity, efficiency, and sustainability in agricultural
value chains. While DAOs have been primarily used in technical
and financial domains, this paper proposes them as speculative
prototypes—conceptual tools rather than fully realized technical
implementations. This approach allows us to critically assess and
imagine how these technologies might be applied to agroecological
contexts, facilitating improved traceability, secure transactions, and
equitable resource access. Projects like Terra0 underscore the spec-
ulative nature of this exploration, which illustrates the potential for
automated, resilient, and self-regulating agroecosystems. However,
it is crucial to recognize that these ideas are still conceptual and
require further development and empirical testing.
Moving forward, there is a need for continued interdisciplinary
research, policy-making, and community engagement to harness
the synergies between technology, ecology, and society. The path to
agroecological regeneration is fraught with complexities and chal-
lenges, but it also presents abundant opportunities for innovation,
collaboration, and transformative change. The future of ecology
calls for cooperation between humans and non-humans, and em-
bracing computational systems can help us foster multispecies re-
lationships. This paper contributes a speculative yet credible visionfor a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient future for agricul-
tural landscapes and the communities that depend on them while
problematizing the agency of technology in our changing world.
