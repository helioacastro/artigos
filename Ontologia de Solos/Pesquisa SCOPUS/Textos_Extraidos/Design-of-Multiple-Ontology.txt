Abstract —Farming is regarded as a major industry in India, accounting for 17% of the country's GDP growth. Agriculture employs 60% of the 
population hence it is considered an important sector in India. The important factors for agriculture are pest management, di sease prevention, 
irrigation management, soil mineral composition, crop management, location, and the season in which the crop is grown. Hence all this 
information along with the techniques are well known only by the experienced farmers. Hence it is importa nt to create an agro knowledge 
management system. As a result, this work makes an attempt to develop a multiple ontology -based agro knowledge management system. The 
designed system consists of agriculture information related to attributes of soil mineral, moisture, season, location, crop t ype, and temperature. It 
consists of multiple ontologies such as soil ontology, crop ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology to provide agronomy 
knowledge. Soil ontology is premeditated to classify the soil t ype in a hierarchical order while crop ontology classifies the crop type, location 
ontology classifies locations suitable for different crop types and finally, crop season ontology classifies the season that is suitable for different 
crops. A rule base is built to develop the knowledge base and to validate the truthfulness of the knowledge base. Visualizati on of a knowledge 
base is carried out for better understanding and decision -making.  
Keywords -ontology; knowledge management system; ontology visualization; data mining; multiple ontology.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
An ontology[16] is a formal description of knowledge that 
includes a group of concepts from a certain field and the 
connections between them. The main objectives of ontology 
are sharable, reusable, and also add new knowledge about the 
domain. The classification and discovery of knowledge get 
much easier when the conceptualization improves the data 
elements through property characteristics. Natural language 
processing[21], machine learning, information retrieval, data 
mining[22], and knowledge representation[23] techniques 
have all contributed to the evolution of ontology development. 
The technique also allows for the creation of numerous 
interpretable patterns that can be used to make future 
predictions. In the field of agriculture, ontology has proved to 
have a broad application in a taxonomy of agriculture 
information, design and building up of information, & 
knowledge base[17] and development of information search 
engines.  
In this attempt, agro knowledge management using 
multiple ontologies is created as soil ontology, crop 
ontology[13], location ontology[14], and crop season ontology. All these ontologies are integrated to ensure 
multilevel reusability and scalability of the agro knowledge 
which serves as an objective of the research attempt. As the 
representations become more practical for incorporating 
information at any time, the knowledge level tends to rise, and 
this may have an impact on the pattern established previously. 
As a result, incremental mining is proposed to accept and 
process the rising data set for inferences without omitting 
previously recognized patterns, and to extract the pattern from 
various sources.  
II. RELATED WORK  
Ontology is served different purposes like knowledge 
management system, knowledge base decision support system, 
expert system, sharing of conceptual data, reuse of knowledge 
domain, and other intelligent systems. Hence ontology is 
becoming a major tool for knowledge representation. The use 
of ontology in the field of agriculture is used for several 
purposes such as knowledge sharing to the farmers and 
supporting farmer decisions. The framework of multiple 
ontology models is useful in representing knowledge across 
various domains which are highlighted in this section.

IJRITCC | July 2023 , Available @ http://www.ijritcc.org  Earlier, A cluster -based multiple ontology parallel merger 
process was proposed by Sunitha abburu[1] et. al(2013). Same 
domain ontology was given as input. For experimental 
purposes, four ontologies are taken. As a result, the 
recommended technique took just 725 milliseconds, reduced 
merging costs across different ontologies, and produced a 
better and more consistent merger ontology.  
SwaranLata[2] et al(2013). have proposed a semantic web 
query on e -governance data and the building of an ontology 
for the agriculture sector. The ontology development 
comprises of identifying the concept, establishing the 
relationship, setting rules, and finally agriculture ontology. As 
a result, a web query ontology model has been 
designed.   Similarly, Chuan Lei et. al(2018) has designed an 
architecture that serves a diversity of an application NLQ 
service, chatbots, and other application that use programming 
API. Ontology query language represent queries that operate 
on a set of concepts and relationships to predict used to 
compare properties, express the join between concepts, use 
binary operation, and use path expression. Finally, an ontology 
based back to back NLQ system to explore the database and 
knowledge base.   
A new cybercrime ontology with multiple perspectives for 
cybercrime classification has been designed by Charlette 
Donalds[3] et. al(2019). The conceptual model consists of a 
designed classification of attacks of various events like 
Email_Hacked, LulzSec associate indicated. As a result, a 
knowledge -based cyber -attack was designed.  Similarly,  A 
framework was designed by Athanasios kiourtis[4] et. 
al(2019) where a non -communicable system to 
communication system for transforming healthcare data into 
ontologies is carried out. A data -driven strategy was designed 
for automating healthcare -related activities, improving disease 
diagnosis, more precisely predicting outcomes, and managing 
patients. As a result, the developed mechanisms created new 
opportunities in the field of healthcare opportunity.    
JinLiu[5] et al(2019). have suggested a deep learning based 
approach to correlate several ontology rule bases that finds 
new suggestion rules. To demonstrate the utility of several 
ontologies, a case study of traffic security application that 
links the vehicle ontology and the traffic management 
ontology has been developed.    
Similarly, Nikolay Shilov[6] et. al(2019) has created a 
standard information model that allows for smooth knowledge 
interchange while maintaining the existing information. As a 
result, an effective information system for multiple ontologies 
with terminologies is built.     
Human Phenotype ontology was initiated to find 
abnormalities in human disease was proposed by Sebastian Kohler[7] et. al(2020). For computationally assessing the 
phenotypic anomalies identified in human disease, a multiple 
ontology model for neurology, nephrology, immunology, 
pulmonology, and newborn screening was created. Likewise, 
an online collaboration portal was developed for a domain 
expert to process a new disease.   Multiple ontology for 
decision support based on the human -machine environment 
which aimed to solve the real -world problem was proposed by 
Alexander Smirnov[8] et. al(2021). To enable interoperability 
between system components and coordinate relevant 
processes, a multi -ontology knowledge decision support 
system built on human -machine collective intelligence is 
created. The method reflected the significance of applying 
multiple ontologies in system development. Having learned 
about the importance and usage of multiple ontologies, this 
system for agronomy is envisioned with the idea of 
incorporating several individual ontologies of a subdomain.  
III. AGRO ONTOLOGY FRAMEWORK  
The framework consists of agro data collection followed 
by data pre -processing[12] and then multiple ontology based 
knowledge models are designed which consist of soil 
ontology[9], crop ontology, location ontology, and crop season 
ontology. To validate the designed framework rule evaluation 
is processed. Agro knowledge visualization[10] is performed 
to bring out a better understanding to the end -user. The design 
of the agro multiple ontology agro kn owledge model is shown 
in Fig.  1.

A. Argo_data acquisition and  validation  
As per the objective of the research, Argo information are 
collected from a reputable exterior source. Soil type, crop 
type, location, crop season, temperature, and humidity are the 
agriculture data collected. In the agro data pre -processing[11], 
data cleaning, and data integration is performed. Inappropriate 
and incomplete data are removed in data cleaning. A data 
integration task is performed where the attribute irrelevant to 
the research objective is removed since the data are collected 
from multiple sources. Pre -processed data are given as input to 
multiple ontology based knowledge models.  
B.  Multiple Ontology based Knowledge model  
Four different sub domains of agronomy such as soil, crop, 
location, and season are considered in this attempt for creating 
the knowledge model. Consequently, Soil ontology, crop 
ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology are 
designed in the multiple ontology based knowledge model.

IJRITCC | July 2023 , Available @ http://www.ijritcc.org  The designed soil ontology consists of soil minerals such as 
calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus are given as 
input and soil type is acquired as result. In crop ontology[18], 
attribute such as  soil classification, temperature, and humidity 
is given as input and crop type is acquired as result. Similarly, 
In location ontology attribute such as soil classification, 
temperature, and crop type are given as input, and crops 
suitable for a particular location are acquired as result. Finally, 
in crop season ontology, attribute such as location, crop type, and temperature are given as input, and crop season is 
obtained as output. All the above ontology design process 
starts with conceptualization which is followed by 
formalization. Collection of germane facts about the 
conceptualization starts with soil mineral for soil ontology, 
crop type for crop ontology, location for location ontology, 
and season for crop season. A semi -structured knowledge base 
is created in the formalization. The ontology taxonomy  is 
shown in Fig . 2 - 5

To bring the truthfulness of the agro  multiple ontology 
knowledge model, rule validation is carried out. For the rule 
evaluation[19], support, confidence, lift, conviction, and 
leverage are used.  
1.  Support  
Support is defined by,  
𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 (𝑋)=Number  of transactions  in X

 In soil ontology, twenty one rules out of twenty eight rules 
are strongly associated. There is no significant association in 
crop ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology. In 
multiple ontology agro knowledge base, seventeen rules have 
values greater than one and five rules are closer to one. Hence 
twenty two rules out of thirty four rules are strongly 
associated.  
4. Conviction  
Conviction is defined by

5. Multiple ontology agro 
knowledge base  [0.78, 1.9]  
 
In soil ontology, fifteen rules out of twenty eight rules are 
strongly associated. There is no significant association in crop 
ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology. In 
multiple ontology agro knowledge base, seventeen rules have 
a value larger than one and twelve rules are nearer to one. 
Hence twenty nine rules out of thirty four rules are strongly 
associated.  
5. Leverage  
Leverage is defined by  
Leverage(X ⇒Y)=Support(X ∪Y)-(Support (X)*Support(Y))  (5) 
TABLE 5  LEVERAGE  
S.No  Ontology  Range

4. Crop season ontology  [-0.12, -0.01]  
5. Multiple ontology agro knowledge 
base [-0.04, 0.05]  
 
The value zero denote independence and a value over zero 
denote desirability of rules. In the soil ontology and crop 
ontology, two rules are not preferable. In location ontology & 
crop season ontology, one rule is not acceptable. In multiple 
ontology agro knowledge base, two rules out of thirty four 
rules are not preferable.

IJRITCC | July 2023 , Available @ http://www.ijritcc.org  IV. CONCLUSION  
The agriculture domain has been represented with help of 
an ontology tool. In this framework, multiple ontology of the 
agro knowledge management system is presented. Hence, soil 
ontology has given different soil types, crop ontology has 
given different crop types, location ontology has given 
different locations suitable for crops, and crop season ontology 
gives season suitable for different crops. Multiple ontology 
agro knowledge base gives better results than individual soil, 
crop, location, and crop season ontology.
