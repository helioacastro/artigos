Abstract: Satoumi is advocated for coastal sustainability under the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD) and the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI), and has provided a basis for
countries around the world to formulate national biodiversity strategies and action plans. Given the
signiﬁcant impact of environmental changes and socio-economic decline, relevant policy directions
and practices are urgently required to promote the sustainable development of ﬁshing communities
in Taiwan. However, local residents and communities are not sufﬁciently aware of or involved in
this concept to facilitate the development of a holistic Satoumi implementation strategy. Therefore,
this study integrates the concepts of Satoumi actions and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and has adopted a questionnaire survey to investigate the perceptions of 202 ﬁshing community
residents in the Gongliao District of New Taipei City and Yilan County towards these concepts. The
standpoint and perception of the ﬁshing community residents regarding Satoumi actions and SDGs
provided a valuable reference. The results of the perception of Satoumi actions revealed that all of
the respondents recognized Satoumi actions. However, the ranking demonstrated the urgency for
some actions (e.g., clear marine litter), and measures that have been implemented in Taiwan but
still need improvement (e.g., ﬁsh stocking practices). Satoumi actions were associated with two
key factors that affect the perception of residents at Satoumi: “Empowerment through community-
based industry and environmental education”, and “Conservation of crucial biological resources and
habitats”. For the SDGs perceptions, the two factors were “Marine socio-economic sustainability”
and “The sustainable use of marine ecological resources”. This study also adopted cluster analysis
and identiﬁed three characteristically different groups of residents: The Conservation Priority Group,
Industry–Society Priority Group, and Balanced Development Group. According to the major research
ﬁndings, policies implemented in coastal areas of Taiwan have aligned with global sustainability
trends. However, the attitude of the Industry–Society Priority Group, which has the largest sample
size, should be changed to that held by the Balanced Development Group, in order to formulate a
strategy for a balanced development that secures existing livelihoods and aligns with expectations on
environmental sustainability. This study suggests that methodologies that encourage stakeholder
interactions, dialogues, and consensus-building should be utilized to develop strategies for future
work. Furthermore, policy tools related to coastal management should be analyzed to establish a
comprehensive toolkit for coastal governance. Finally, Satoumi requires public–private collaboration
to achieve both biodiversity conservation and transformative change towards more sustainably and
equitably social, environmental, and economic coastal development.

1. Introduction
The adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at the Earth Summit in
1992 marked a new age, in which countries around the world began working together to
promote biodiversity conservation. After nearly two decades, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets
were proposed at the Tenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diver-
sity (CBD-COP10) in 2010. CBD-COP10 outlined the speciﬁc goal: “By 2050, biodiversity is
valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a
healthy planet and delivering beneﬁts essential for all people”. The Satoyama Initiative
was also presented at the CBD-COP10, placing emphasis on the economic, cultural, and
natural aspects of sustainable development [ 1], while also focusing on the concept of Socio-
ecological Production Landscapes and Seascapes (SEPLS). The purpose of the Satoyama
Initiative was to promote the maintenance and use of SEPLS in various localities (agricul-
ture, forestry, ﬁshery, livestock farming) by improving community resilience to achieve
sustainability. For this reason, the United Nations University also launched the Interna-
tional Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) as the centerpiece for reaching the Aichi
Biodiversity Targets and achieving the goals of biodiversity conservation, preservation
of local traditional knowledge, and community development [ 2]. In line with the global
trend of mainstreaming biodiversity, Taiwan drafted a Biodiversity Promotion Program
in 2001 and adopted the Aichi Biodiversity Targets to revise its Biodiversity Sustainable
Development Action Plan in 2012.
The hydrosphere (e.g., sea, ocean) is an integral component of the earth’s life support
system and also a key asset that creates opportunities for human sustainability. As the
Satoyama Initiative garnered increasing attention, the promotion and development of
Satoumi became the key approach for coastal ﬁshing communities to live in harmony with
the coastal socio-ecological systems. In particular, efforts under Satoumi and the 2015
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are both concerned with the social, economic, and
environmental aspects of sustainability with Goal 14 of the SDGs being to conserve and
sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. In
addition, Goals 8 (sustained and inclusive economic growth), 11 (sustainable society and
communities), and 12 (responsible production and consumption patterns) are also aligned
with the core concept of Satoumi, which covers ecosystem services, traditional knowledge
and modern science, nature conservation, and environmental and economic sustainability
through human–nature interaction (management) [ 3]. Taking Japan as an example, the birth
place of the Satoyama and Satoumi concepts, the local residents of Shiretoko Peninsula in
Hokkaido have become a vital part of the traditional water ecosystem in the area, positively
maintaining the interactive effects between humans and the natural ecosystem [ 4]. A study
of the Sekisei Lagoon in southwest Japan revealed that in the local lagoon socio-ecological
systems, all stakeholders are closely connected at the socio-ecological level and completely
linked to the lagoon’s ecosystem services, where traditional users have a critical role to
play in the sustainability of socio-ecological systems [ 5]. Therefore, the sea or ocean and
coastal ecosystems have a close and complex connection with local users. Furthermore, the
Japanese government has been proactive in adopting the SDGs in its National Strategies for
Promoting Biodiversity of Japan, and including the Satoumi approach as the main means
of integrated coastal management and restoring estuaries and bays to drive beneﬁts for
ecosystem services [6].
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reported that
small-scale ﬁsheries can generate sufﬁcient income to support ﬁshing families, but income
stability and sustainability will be a major challenge in sustainable development [ 7]. The
coast of Taiwan is typically bustling with ﬁshing activities, providing a source of protein
and job opportunities for Taiwanese citizens along the coast. Previously, there were over
250 ﬁshing harbors in Taiwan, forming ﬁshing settlements in nearby areas. However,
ﬁshing communities are mostly located in rural areas, which have been affected by a
multitude of sustainability problems, such as an exodus of young people, aging of residents,
job scarcity, aging of labor population, and a lack of public facilities and infrastructure
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 3 of 19
services [ 8,9]. In addition, coastal ﬁsheries are facing climate change, overﬁshing, and
depletion of resources, among other problems, all of which not only inﬂuence the economic
development of ﬁsheries but also worsen the decline of ﬁshing communities. Thus, new
policy directions and practices are urgently required to drive the sustainable development
of ﬁshing communities. There has been a dearth of research in Taiwan exploring how ﬁshing
community residents perceive public affairs, the development of ﬁshing communities, and
sustainability issues [ 8–10]. There still is, nevertheless, limited or a lack of comprehensive
understanding of the perception of ﬁshing community residents. Numerous policies have
been enforced to date, providing a basis for policy makers and decision makers to slowly
understand the needs of local communities. However, the Satoumi approach is a concept
based on the international Satoyama Initiative for promoting coastal sustainability. The
local residents and communities are not sufﬁciently aware or involved to facilitate the
development of a holistic Satoumi implementation strategy. For this reason, the objectives
of this study were to adopt a questionnaire survey and quantitative analysis methods to
investigate the perceptions of ﬁshing community residents in the Northeast Coast of Taiwan,
regarding Satoumi initiatives and SDGs, and to analyze the diverse characteristics of ﬁshing
community residents. Subsequently, by reviewing coastal development policy trends in
Taiwan and relevant research ﬁndings in this study, suggestions were provided for the
formulation of speciﬁc coastal development strategies for sustainable coastal management
in northeastern Taiwan.
2. Satoumi Development in Taiwan
As mentioned in the introduction, Satoyama and Satoumi were advocated under
the CBD and provided a basis for countries around the world to formulate their national
biodiversity strategies and action plans. Japan, as the birthplace of Satoyama and Satoumi,
has accumulated many cases since the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Taiwan and Japan are
both located in East Asia with similar social environments, industry patterns, and ﬁshing
villages along their coastlines. Taiwan has also referred to Japan’s related policies in the
past [ 11]. Therefore, ﬁshing villages in Taiwan’s coastal areas that are facing unsustainable
development conditions, in terms of socio-economy and ecological environment, need to
consider corresponding strategies. The guidance and case studies provided by Satoumi
have the potential to be applied in Taiwan. This section will introduce the concept of the
Satoumi in more detail and how it can inﬂuence Taiwan’s related policies.
2.1. Satoumi Concept
Satoumi can be understood to be landscapes and seascapes formed by human–nature
interaction (i.e., between houses, settlements, or communities and estuaries, lagoons, coasts,
bays, and other ecosystems). The Satoumi concept originated from the concept of Satoyama.
Satoyama refers to mosaic landscapes composed of various ecosystems including wetlands,
grasslands, woodlands, farmlands, paddy ﬁelds, and settlements resulting from the long-
term interaction between rural residents and their surrounding environment [ 12]. As the
Satoyama Initiative garnered increasing attention since the CBD-COP10, the promotion and
development of Satoumi became the key approach for coastal sustainability. Yanagi [ 13]
proposed the concept of Satoumi, deﬁning it as a coastal area with high productivity and
biodiversity due to human activities or human–nature interaction. Satoumi is considered a
multifaceted concept. In simple terms, Satoumi represents the ideal relationship created
between humans and the sea or ocean. It is also a coastal management system, combining
traditional knowledge, modern science, and the contributions of varying stakeholders to
sustain the desired state of coastal zones through adaptive management. Finally, Satoumi
reﬂects a socio-ecological context that changes with time and place [ 1,14]. In light of this,
Satoumi can serve as a new approach to promoting sustainable ﬁshery management [15].
Under the guidance of national policies, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of Japan
devised a three-year plan in 2008 to support the creation of Satoumi. They called for
applications from local governments and launched a series of community-based projects
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 4 of 19
aimed at protecting the marine coastal environmental system and realizing the vision
of humans in harmony with the sea or ocean. Small-sum subsidies are also provided
to support local activities that align with the Satoumi concept. The MOE surveyed the
diverse range of Satoumi activities in Japan, subsequently releasing the Satoumi Manual of
Japan in 2011. The manual details of various Satoumi activities, including the restoration
of seaweed forests, clearing of marine litter, environmental survey and monitoring, ﬁsh
stocking, marine or ﬁshery experience activities, removal of alien species, and collection
of data on educational activities. The Satoumi creation initiative by the MOE of Japan is
focused on ﬁve elements: (1) substance circulation (nutrient salts, water quality, and bottom
sediment), (2) ecosystems (diversity, productivity, resource management), (3) contact with
people (regional cooperation, coexistence with nature), (4) activity spheres (ﬁshing villages,
cities, watershed), and (5) entities that perform activities (ﬁshers, residents, or relevant
stakeholders). The ﬁrst three elements are diversity elements that require preservation
and regeneration, and the last two elements are related to Satoumi activities that are key
to ensuring the sustainability of Satoumi creation [ 16]. Further investigation of activi-
ties that support Satoumi creation shows that 65% of Satoumi activities are performed
mainly by local entities, which included residents (23%), ﬁshers (17%), and local public
organizations (25%), while 35% are performed by educational organizations (12%), research
institutions (6%), the state (8%), and others (9%) [ 17]. These statistics highlight not only the
importance of the local involvement in Satoumi practices [18], but also the need to design
a “mechanism” consisting of the aforementioned elements to promote Satoumi creation.
Therefore, solving the accelerated loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services requires a
community-based approach to sustainably use and manage natural resources and linking
diverse stakeholders, as well as making collaborative decisions during the process [ 19].
Satoumi is an initiative which advocates for a stakeholder-engaged approach to performing
activities under a socio-ecological view. Because the linkages and interactions of local
life, local industries, local culture, biodiversity, and environmental sustainability must be
considered, the standpoint and perception of local entities regarding Satoumi activities will
provide a valuable reference.
2.2. Relevant Policy in Taiwan
Taiwan currently has 222 ﬁshing harbors along the coast. The construction of ﬁsh-
ing harbors has attracted ﬁshers to settle nearby, thus forming ﬁshing settlements and
communities. Traditionally, ﬁshing communities are mostly located in remote or rural
areas. In 1949, the Taiwan government began making construction and policy plans for
rural communities, but these plans never came to fruition. It was only until 1993—the
year a government-funded ﬁshing community development project was launched—that
policy planning for the construction of ﬁshing communities was carried out to beautify
ﬁshing communities as a whole and build a ﬁshing settlement that is characterized by
special landscapes, unique customs, and ﬁshery culture. Under the notion of community
development, the development of ﬁshing communities slowly shifted from a government-
dominated top-down approach to a bottom-up approach that consolidates the collective
awareness and value concepts of local residents on the basis of farming/ﬁshing settlements
or communities. In 2010, the Taiwan government launched the Rural Rejuvenation Program
and enforced the Rural Rejuvenation Act, empowering community residents to propose
plans that improve community environment, boost industry economy, and retain local
characteristics in a regulated manner. To address the exodus of rural farming and ﬁshing
populations, the National Development Council implemented the local placemaking policy
in 2019, hoping to facilitate balanced urban–rural development and promote local pros-
perity. According to the policy, 134 areas are prioritized for placemaking promotion due
to their severe population loss and relative disadvantages; 41 of these areas are coastal
regions, which implies that coastal ﬁshing communities are in dire need of development.
The sustainable development of ﬁshing communities involves diverse stakehold-
ers [10]. Coastal management in Taiwan is assigned across various ministerial departments
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 5 of 19
with each paying increasingly more attention in recent years to the adoption of the Satoumi
approach for coastal zone management and sustainable development. For example, in
2020, the Ocean Conservation Administration launched the community-based marine
conservation program, which aims to guide local organizations on marine conservation
measures and help them use localization methods to protect the sea and ocean. In the
same year, the National Academy of Marine Research launched a Satoumi settlement
support program, uniting local youths in coastal areas to boost industrial development.
Additionally, the Construction and Planning Agency of the Minister of the Interior initiated
a locally integrated coastal management program; the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau
of the Council of Agriculture launched a rural rejuvenation program to guide farming and
ﬁshing communities on autonomous planning; the Forestry Bureau and Fisheries Research
Institute of Council of Agriculture promoted the regional development of Satoumi by using
socio-ecological systems to consolidate perspectives; and the Fisheries Agency focused on
the development of ﬁshing industries and hardware infrastructure.
Based on the above reviews of relevant policies, Taiwan has seen a large number of
coastal residents involved in community affairs, local development, industrial promotion,
and sustainable development policies. This trend reveals the spirit of the Satoumi concept
that advocates a stakeholder-engaged approach. However, the conservation of the marine
and coastal ecosystems should be considered under Satoumi development, and a holistic,
integrated thinking approach should also be more actualized.
3. Research Method
3.1. Research Scope
The scope of this study included the Gongliao District and Yilan County on the north-
eastern coast of New Taipei City in Taiwan. Coastal ﬁsheries are particularly prosperous in
these areas, leading to the formation of many ﬁshing settlements. As of March 2023, the
local population is as follows: approximately 11,177 people in the Gongliao area, and a total
of 137,483 people in the coastal towns and villages of Yilan County, including 28,409 people
in Toucheng, 24,445 people in Zhuangwei, 40,774 people in Wujie, 37,760 people in Su’ao,
and 6095 people in Nan’ao [ 20]. Fishing harbors and communities in the Gongliao District
include Longdone, Hemei, Meiyanshan, Aodi, Longmen, Fulong, Mao’ao, and Magang.
Those in Yilan County include Shihcheng, Tongpanku, Dali, Daxi, Fanshuliao, Gengfang,
Wushi, Wuweigang, Nanfang’ao, Fenniaolin, and Nan’ao (Figure 1).

 communit ies has become a critical research topic that requires academic attention and in-
tervention.

3.2. Questionnaire Content  
This study adopted  a questionnaire survey to investigate the perceptions of fishing 
community residents regarding the promotion of Satoumi. A three -part questionnaire was 
designed with reference to the Satoumi Manual of Japan  [16] and the Japan Satoyama 
Satoumi Assessment [22 ]. The first part, Satoumi Actions dimension, comprised 14 items 
which were derived from the Satoumi activities undertaken in various parts of Japan as 
described in the Satoumi Manual of Japan. The second part, SDGs Perceptions dimension, 
comprised 7 items . The third part was background information, which was designed to 
collect data on the respondents’ gender, place of residence, education level, occupation, 
income, age, and whether they are local. The first and second parts of the questionnaire 
were score d using the Likert 5 -point scale to indicate the level of perception. The third 
part provided information for subsequent analysis of residents’ characteristics. After the 
questionnaire was designed, a pretest was conducted on it by experts in July 2020. An y 
ambiguous wordings were revised to increase the reliability and validity of the question-
naire, and then the official questionnaire was distributed.  
3.3. Sampling  
The questionnaire survey was conducted on local residents and fishers of communi-
ties along t he coast of  the Gongliao District through to Yilan County. Because the liveli-
hoods of fishing community residents mostly depend on fishing -related industries, a ma-
jority of their time is typically spent working at sea or on preparatory works, which made 
random sampling difficult. This study , therefore,  selected convenience sampling using the 
snowball sampling method. Due to t he limitation  of sampling, the formal survey was con-
ducted by in -person, and some questionnaires were delivered with the assistance of  com-
munity development associations, fishers’ associations, and fishing community residents. 
The survey took place between August and October in 2020. In total, 202 valid question-
naires were retrieved, after excluding invalid questionnaires with incomplete  answers.

Regarding the research scope, which are the coastal ﬁshing villages in counties in
northeastern Taiwan, it is worth noting that Taiwan’s early development was primarily
reliant on the coastal and offshore ﬁsheries. In terms of the coastal and offshore ﬁsheries
production in Taiwan in 2021, Yilan County, Keelung City, and New Taipei City were
the primary contributors [ 21], highlighting the importance of the coastal and offshore
ﬁsheries industry in northeastern Taiwan [ 10]. Nevertheless, in recent years, coastal and
offshore ﬁsheries have suffered from the depletion of resources, resulting from factors
such as overﬁshing, ﬁsh habitat destruction, environmental pollution, and climate change.
During the 1970s, the annual production was over 400,000 tonnes. However, by 1981, the
production had dropped to under 400,000 tonnes. As of 2007, the yield had further declined
to below 200,000 tonnes. Currently, the production ranges from 160,000 to 180,000 tonnes
annually [21].
Coastal villages in Taiwan have been greatly impacted by Taiwan’s economic devel-
opment and industrial restructuring as well. These rural communities face a myriad of
challenges, such as limited employment opportunities, population outﬂow, an aging ﬁshing
demographic, inadequate public facilities and infrastructure, and stagnating progress in im-
proving production and living environments [ 9], all of which impede their ability to achieve
sustainable development. As a result, the sustainable development of ﬁshing communities
has become a critical research topic that requires academic attention and intervention.
3.2. Questionnaire Content
This study adopted a questionnaire survey to investigate the perceptions of ﬁshing
community residents regarding the promotion of Satoumi. A three-part questionnaire
was designed with reference to the Satoumi Manual of Japan [ 16] and the Japan Satoyama
Satoumi Assessment [ 22]. The ﬁrst part, Satoumi Actions dimension, comprised 14 items
which were derived from the Satoumi activities undertaken in various parts of Japan as
described in the Satoumi Manual of Japan. The second part, SDGs Perceptions dimension,
comprised 7 items. The third part was background information, which was designed to
collect data on the respondents’ gender, place of residence, education level, occupation,
income, age, and whether they are local. The ﬁrst and second parts of the questionnaire
were scored using the Likert 5-point scale to indicate the level of perception. The third
part provided information for subsequent analysis of residents’ characteristics. After the
questionnaire was designed, a pretest was conducted on it by experts in July 2020. Any am-
biguous wordings were revised to increase the reliability and validity of the questionnaire,
and then the ofﬁcial questionnaire was distributed.
3.3. Sampling
The questionnaire survey was conducted on local residents and ﬁshers of communities
along the coast of the Gongliao District through to Yilan County. Because the livelihoods
of ﬁshing community residents mostly depend on ﬁshing-related industries, a majority of
their time is typically spent working at sea or on preparatory works, which made random
sampling difﬁcult. This study, therefore, selected convenience sampling using the snowball
sampling method. Due to the limitation of sampling, the formal survey was conducted
by in-person, and some questionnaires were delivered with the assistance of community
development associations, ﬁshers’ associations, and ﬁshing community residents. The
survey took place between August and October in 2020. In total, 202 valid questionnaires
were retrieved, after excluding invalid questionnaires with incomplete answers.
3.4. Statistical Analysis Method
To provide a proﬁle of the research samples, the ﬁrst stage of the statistical analysis
involved analyzing the sample demographics by using descriptive statistics, including
frequency distribution and percentage. The perception of the respondents in Gongliao
and Yilan regarding Satoumi actions was subsequently analyzed, using mean, frequency
distribution, and ranking to describe how each action was perceived.
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 7 of 19
The second stage of the statistical analysis was focused on exploring the effects that
the characteristics of residents at Satoumi have on the perception of Satoumi actions and
SDGs. Regarding statistical operations, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed
in combination with principal components analysis (PCA) to streamline the items under
both of the questionnaire dimensions into smaller perception variables [ 23]. A principal
component method combined with the varimax rotation technique was used to identify
and name the key perception variables. Cluster analysis was employed to classify the
respondents into several groups [ 24]. Hierarchical clustering, based on the residents’
perception of Satoumi actions, was performed to select the number of clusters, and then
K-means clustering was adopted to distinguish respondents with different perceptions.
After the number of clusters of respondents was determined, analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was employed to analyze differences between the perception of each variable
under both dimensions. Any signiﬁcant differences were further analyzed using Scheffe’s
method (post-hoc test). Finally, the chi-squared test for cross-analysis was used to analyze
the differences between the basic attributes of resident clusters who had different perceptions.
4. Results
4.1. Ranking of Satoumi Action Perceptions
In general, the top three actions perceived as the most important by all of the re-
spondents were as follows: “clear marine litter”, “promote environmental education”,
and “conserve priority species”. The three actions perceived as the least important by the
respondents were as follows: “marine and land resource surveys”, “remove alien species”,
and “ﬁsh stocking practices” (Table 1).

4.2. Results of Factor Analysis
This study adopted a principal component method in conjunction with the varimax ro-
tation technique to determine key perception variables under the two dimensions: Satoumi
Actions and SDGs Perceptions. For items under the Satoumi Actions dimension, the
Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value was 0.867 and the Bartlett’s test was signiﬁcant at the
0.01 level ( x2= 1703.616, p< 0.01). For items under the SDGs Perceptions dimension, the
KMO value was 0.801, and the Bartlett’s test was signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level ( x2= 652.947,
p< 0.01). The results indicate that both dimensions were appropriate [25].
The factors under each dimension, with an eigenvalue greater than one, were re-
tained, and items with a factor loading greater than 0.65 were retained. For both dimen-
sions, all of the factors had a Cronbach’s alpha of greater than 0.8, indicating that the
internal reliability of factors is excellent. Based on the respondents’ response, two per-
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 8 of 19
ception factors were selected from the Satoumi Actions dimension: (1) Empowerment
through community-based industry and environmental education (eigenvalue = 3.071,
proportion = 38.39 , Cronbach’s a = 0.888), and (2) Conservation of crucial biological re-
sources and habitats ( eigenvalue = 2.855 , proportion = 35.69, Cronbach’s a = 0.868) (Table 2).
Two perception factors were also selected from the SDGs Perceptions dimension: (1) Ma-
rine socio-economic sustainability (eigenvalue = 2.495, proportion = 41.59, Cronbach’s
a = 0.818 ), and (2) The sustainable use of marine ecological resources (eigenvalue = 1.933,
proportion = 32.21, Cronbach’s a = 0.885) (Table 3).

4.3. The Results of Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis
Clustering of residents was based on the items under the Satoumi Actions dimension,
which were selected using factor analysis in the preceding section. Subsequently, a two-
stage cluster analysis [ 26] was performed. First, this study identiﬁed three clusters by using
hierarchical clustering. Then, K-means clustering was used to distinguish residents who
had different perceptions. The results revealed that Clusters I, II, and III had 34, 89, and
79 participants, respectively. In addition, a discriminant analysis was employed to test the

4.4. Types of Residents
For this section, the types of respondents were determined. Based on the ANOVA
and Scheff é’s test results (Table 5, Figure 2), each cluster was classiﬁed according to the
perceptions of Satoumi actions and SDGs, and the clusters were subsequently named.
Based on the results for the perception of Satoumi actions, Clusters I and II exhibited a
non-signiﬁcant difference in their perception regarding the factor “Empowerment through
community-based industry and environmental education (SA-Empowerment)”, whereas
Clusters I and III exhibited a non-signiﬁcant difference in their perception regarding the
factor “Conservation of crucial biological resources and habitats (SA-Conservation)”. Based
on the results for the perception of SDGs, Clusters I and II exhibited non-signiﬁcant
difference in their perception regarding the factor “Marine socio-economic sustainability
(SDGs-Socio-economic)”, whereas Clusters I and III exhibited a non-signiﬁcant difference
in their perception regarding the factor “The sustainable use of marine ecological resources
(SDGs-Ecological)”. These three clusters were then assigned a name to facilitate the strategic
planning for target populations in the future.

(1) Cluster I—Conservation Priority Group: This cluster consisted of 34 respondents
(16.83%) and was named Conservation Priority Group because the respondents in this
cluster had a higher level of perception on marine conservation factors (SA-Conservation,
SDG-Ecological factors) (perception level > 4.5) than on factors related to industrial devel-
opment (SA-Empowerment, SDG-Social & Economic).

(2) Cluster II—Industry–Society Priority Group: 89 respondents (44.06%) were clus-
tered into this group because they exhibited a higher level of perception (>4.0) on factors
related to industrial promotion (SA-Empowerment) and socio-economic development
(SDG-Social & Economic). This cluster was thus named Industry–Society Priority Group.
(3) Cluster III—Balanced Development Group: 79 respondents (39.11%) were clustered
into this group. They exhibited a high level of perception (mean score > 4.5) on four factors
under the two dimensions of Satoumi Actions and SDGs Perception. This cluster was
therefore named Balanced Development Group.

4.5. Cross-Analysis Results
Cross-analysis and chi-squared tests are used to ascertain the demographic differences
among each cluster of residents. The cross-analysis results of socio-economic demographics
are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 3. In comparing the gender of the residents in
each cluster, the analysis results revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences ( x2= 7.904 ,
p = 0.019 * ). Male residents made up the majority of the Conservation Priority Group
(70.6%), and the Industry–Society Priority Group and Balanced Development Group com-
prised mainly female residents (57.3% and 53.2%, respectively). In comparing the place of
residence across each cluster, the analysis results revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences
(x2= 16.985 ,p = 0.009 ** ). In total, 70.6% of the residents in Conservation Priority Group
lived in Gongliao (35.3%) and southern Yilan (35.3%), whereas most of the residents in
the Industry–Society Priority Group took up residence in Gongliao (46.1%) and a majority
in the Balanced Development Group lived in southern Yilan (46.8%). Regarding the resi-
dents’ education level, the results indicated statistically signiﬁcant differences ( x2= 39.863 ,
p = 0.000 ** ). The Conservation Priority Group was made up of residents with a bachelor’s
degree (44.1%); nearly half of the residents in the Industry–Society Priority Group have
completed primary and junior high school (49.4%); and the Balanced Development Group
was composed of residents with a bachelor’s degree (40.5%). The occupation of each resi-
dent across all clusters showed statistically signiﬁcant differences ( x2= 25.551 ,p = 0.000 ** ).

Providing industrial/commercial services was the occupation of most of the respondents in
the Conservation Priority Group (50.0%), followed by public services (29.4%). Users of natu-
ral resources formed the majority in the Industry–Society Priority Group (37.1%), followed
by industrial/commercial service providers (30.3%). Providing industrial/commercial
services (41.8%) followed by public services (24.1%) was the occupation of most of the
respondents in the Balanced Development Group. In examining residents’ income across
clusters, the results showed statistically signiﬁcant differences ( x2= 11.489 ,p = 0.022 * ). A
majority of residents in the Conservation Priority Group (52.9%) and the Balanced Develop-
ment Group (48.1%) earned an annual income of NT$360,000–NT$710,000; while residents
in the Industry–Society Priority Group mostly earned an annual income below NT$360,000
(55.1%). In analyzing the residents’ age across clusters, the results also showed statistically
signiﬁcant differences ( x2= 20.627 ,p = 0.002 ** ). The Conservation Priority Group was made
up of younger residents, aged 35 years or younger (32.4%) and 35–49 years-old (26.5%); the
Industry–Society Priority Group comprised older residents, aged 65 years or older (38.2%)
and 50–64 years-old (31.5%); and the Balanced Development Group consisted of mostly
middle-aged residents, aged 35–49 years-old (35.4%) and 50–64 years-old (30.4%).

5. Discussion and Policy Implications  
The value of Satoumi  lies in the realization of a society in harmony with ecosystems 
through an awareness of local needs and acquiescence to diverse opinions and contribu-
tions. Therefore,  whether relevant policies introduced by the government are enforced 
under the opinions a nd awareness of the majority is imperative [27] . The discussion of this 
study is presented in two aspects.  
5.1. The Trend Observed Based on Coastal Residents’ Perceptions  
5.1.1. Ranking of the Perception of Satoumi Actions  
The ranking of the perception of Satoumi actions revealed that all of the respondents 
recognized Satoumi actions, attaching particular importance to the actions, “clearing ma-
rine litter ( m = 4.56)”, “promoting environmental education ( m = 4.47)”, and “conserving 
priority species ( m = 4.41)”. This result may be attributed to the global impact of marine 
litter on the coastal environment or fisheries in recent years, which is an emerging marine 
conservation issue that has also made the general public and local residents who rely on 
the ocean for their livelihoods realize the urgency of marine environmental education.  
For actions  that ranked in the middle -range priority, respondents attached the im-
portance of intervention measures for contexts in the Northeast Coast of Taiwan, particu-
larly for crucial livelihood resources (e.g., “protect and manage fishing ground, m = 4.32”) 
and related environments (e.g., “protect and create habitats, m = 4.27”). On the other hand, 
due to the predominance of traditional industries in the study area, negative pe rceptions 
of the traditional industries and the outflow of human resources caused by urbanization 
have resulted in the declining trend of coastal industries. Respondents’ emphasis on “fish-
ery revitalization and innovation ( m = 4.29)” may be due to their desire for new develop-
ment through  a new means to bring  about socio-economic benefits [28]. However, to find 
available resources or draw up a development direction, the involvement of local stake-
holders is required, and “fishing community development  (m = 4.27)” is one of the key 
drivers of these actions. Similar experiences, cases, and discourses have also been found 
in other Satoumi cases [3,28]. Although actions related to “build a database for Satoumi 
promotion ( m = 4.28)” or “organize Satoumi exc hange activities ( m = 4.28)” were not 
highly prioritized by respondents, these actions still hold the potential for strengthening 
the relationship between the sea and people , and enhancing ocean literacy [29], which is 
crucial for cultivating potential sup porters for ocean conservation and sustainable devel-
opment in the future.  
The finding reveals an important insight in to lower-ranked priority actions, indicat-
ing not to overlook fundamental works such as resource investigation (e.g., “survey and 
preserve l ocal knowledge, m = 4.24”; “survey marine and land resource, m = 4.21”), espe-
cially under the deteriorating trend of  the erosion of traditional knowledge and practices,

5. Discussion and Policy Implications
The value of Satoumi lies in the realization of a society in harmony with ecosystems
through an awareness of local needs and acquiescence to diverse opinions and contributions.
Therefore, whether relevant policies introduced by the government are enforced under the
opinions and awareness of the majority is imperative [ 27]. The discussion of this study is
presented in two aspects.
5.1. The Trend Observed Based on Coastal Residents’ Perceptions
5.1.1. Ranking of the Perception of Satoumi Actions
The ranking of the perception of Satoumi actions revealed that all of the respondents
recognized Satoumi actions, attaching particular importance to the actions, “clearing marine
litter (m = 4.56)”, “promoting environmental education (m = 4.47)”, and “conserving
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 13 of 19
priority species (m = 4.41)”. This result may be attributed to the global impact of marine
litter on the coastal environment or ﬁsheries in recent years, which is an emerging marine
conservation issue that has also made the general public and local residents who rely on
the ocean for their livelihoods realize the urgency of marine environmental education.
For actions that ranked in the middle-range priority, respondents attached the impor-
tance of intervention measures for contexts in the Northeast Coast of Taiwan, particularly
for crucial livelihood resources (e.g., “protect and manage ﬁshing ground, m = 4.32”) and
related environments (e.g., “protect and create habitats, m = 4.27”). On the other hand, due
to the predominance of traditional industries in the study area, negative perceptions of the
traditional industries and the outﬂow of human resources caused by urbanization have
resulted in the declining trend of coastal industries. Respondents’ emphasis on “ﬁshery
revitalization and innovation (m = 4.29)” may be due to their desire for new development
through a new means to bring about socio-economic beneﬁts [ 28]. However, to ﬁnd avail-
able resources or draw up a development direction, the involvement of local stakeholders
is required, and “ﬁshing community development (m = 4.27)” is one of the key drivers
of these actions. Similar experiences, cases, and discourses have also been found in other
Satoumi cases [ 3,28]. Although actions related to “build a database for Satoumi promotion
(m = 4.28)” or “organize Satoumi exchange activities (m = 4.28)” were not highly prioritized
by respondents, these actions still hold the potential for strengthening the relationship be-
tween the sea and people, and enhancing ocean literacy [ 29], which is crucial for cultivating
potential supporters for ocean conservation and sustainable development in the future.
The ﬁnding reveals an important insight into lower-ranked priority actions, indicating
not to overlook fundamental works such as resource investigation (e.g., “survey and pre-
serve local knowledge, m = 4.24”; “survey marine and land resource, m = 4.21”), especially
under the deteriorating trend of the erosion of traditional knowledge and practices, which
emphasize the maintenance, use, and transmission of traditional knowledge as an active
cultural resource in society [ 30]. Using “launch ocean experience activities (m = 4.22)” as an
example, it is highly suitable to integrate the knowledge of local ﬁshermen, residents, and
experts regarding the local environment and biology of ﬁshing villages into the design of
the experiential activities, in order to enhance civic interaction and interest in the ocean [ 16].
As the promotion of Satoumi is based on the local ecology and local actors, a comprehensive
inventory is necessary to understand and identify the complex relationships and potential
issues or opportunities that may arise from the interactions between social and ecological
actors [31].
Compared to other actions, “remove alien species (m = 4.13)” ranks second to last.
This may be due to the issue not currently causing signiﬁcant livelihood difﬁculties for
respondents and is therefore not considered an urgent matter. However, this does not
mean that the issue is unimportant. There have been anecdotal reports of religious release
activities in Taiwan involving species such as Tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x
Epinephelus lanceolatus , but their ecological impact remains to be investigated. Additionally,
escapes of aquaculture species (e.g., red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus ) may also have potential
impacts on marine ecosystems [ 32]. In the case of Okinawa in Japan, ﬁshermen took
proactive measures to remove the crown-of-thorns starﬁsh, which was found to have an
impact on the coral reef ecosystem [ 33]. Our study’s ﬁndings differ from other cases in the
current context. Previous research indicates that marine invasive alien species receive less
attention, and their impacts are not adequately recorded. Therefore, there is a need for the
systematic monitoring and management of invasive alien species, particularly in marine
and tropical regions [34].
“Fish stocking practices (m = 4.06)” were perceived as the least important among
respondents living in Yilan and Gongliao, so the next important step is thinking of ways to
raise residents’ awareness of the beneﬁts of ﬁsh stocking practices. Previously, a Japanese
study presented various evidence showing that ﬁsh stocking is unnecessary (because of low
recapture rate and the low economic efﬁciency of stocking). However, stock enhancement

ﬁshers recognize the importance of ﬁshery management. Nevertheless, Japan overcame
this problem by contributing released ﬁsh to total landings, which enables ﬁshers to be
personally involved in conservation efforts while effectively utilizing ﬁshery resources and
understanding the importance of ﬁshery management [ 35]. This approach can serve as a
reference for Taiwanese authorities.
5.1.2. Personal Characteristics of Three-Type Residents
Past studies showed that socio-economic factors inﬂuenced the environmental aware-
ness, attitudes, and behaviors of residents. For example, a study observed that uneducated
populations were unsupportive of conservation efforts compared with the educated pop-
ulations [ 36]. Masud and Kari [ 37] reported that younger people were more aware of
environmental problems than their counterparts because young people have easier access
to information, such as the mass media and social networks. Income is also a key factor
inﬂuencing environmental awareness [ 37,38]. According to the result of cluster analysis, the
clusters were characteristically the same as the results of the aforementioned studies. For ex-
ample, the Industry–Society Priority Group which has the highest number of people ( n= 89)
differed characteristically from the respondents in the Conservation Priority Group and
Balanced Development Group. Speciﬁcally, the Conservation Priority Group and Balanced
Development Group consisted mainly of respondents with a higher education level (44.1%
and 44.5% have a bachelor’s degree, respectively), providers of industrial/commercial
services (50.0% and 41.8%, respectively), and moderate income earners (52.9% and 48.1%,
respectively). In comparison, the Industry–Society Priority Group mainly consisted of
respondents with primary and junior high school education (49.4%), low income earners
(55.1%), users of natural resources (37.1%), and older respondents (38.2%). Based on this
empirical study and the researcher’s current observation of coastal ﬁshing communities in
Taiwan, residents of ﬁshing communities are generally older and capable of tapping into the
wisdom they have gained throughout their life to utilize coastal resources. The respondents
in the Industry–Society Priority Group highly valued the factor “empowerment through
community-based industry and environmental education” probably because of their at-
tempt to search for diverse resources to strengthen their industrial competency in order to
tackle the challenges arising from marine pollution and the depletion of marine resources.
The respondents in this group also recognized the importance of “marine socio-economic
sustainability”, which further highlights how much they valued employment opportu-
nities for ﬁshing communities, sales and marketing channels, cultural preservation, and
acquisition of knowledge and skills. The Conservation Priority Group highly valued the
“conservation of crucial biological resources and habitats” and “sustainable use of marine
ecological resources.” After the lifting of martial law in 1987, coastal areas in Taiwan were
frequently used to engage in various activities, particularly water recreational activities
related to the service sector [ 39]. However, the service sector is not only a user of marine
resources, but also a provider of tourism travel services. Therefore, stakeholders in this
sector tend to use the environment and natural resources more wisely because of their
industry characteristics. Finally, the Balanced Development Group held a high level of
perception toward socio-economic development and environmental protection. According
to the ﬁndings of this study and the results of relevant empirical research, individual
beliefs or governmental policies have demonstrated a shift from the emphasis on absolute
development or restrictions among other binary approaches to a commitment to marine
conservation and the stability of social and economic development [8,40,41].
5.2. Consideration of Diverse Opinions Facilitates the Balanced Development of Coastal Areas
The observation of this study, with respect to the larger sample size of the Balanced
Development Group, revealed that to a certain extent, most of the residents along the
northeastern coast of Taiwan have hoped to consider the balanced development between
the economy, environment, and society when thinking about coastal actions and sustain-
ability issues. There is actually a development context in which such a result occurs. In
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 15 of 19
line with the global trend of mainstreaming biodiversity, Taiwan also drafted a Biodiversity
Promotion Program in 2001 and adopted the Aichi Biodiversity Targets to revise its Biodi-
versity Sustainable Development Action Plan in 2012. Drawing on the foundation of the
Taiwan Ecological Network, the Council of Agriculture of Executive Yuan built a network
of partnerships and collaborative governance for Satoumi landscapes and the ecological
blue way. Based on the foundation of its afﬁliated agencies, the Fisheries Agency and
Fisheries Research Institute, the Council of Agriculture embraced the support of the coastal
and ocean sustainable partners (e.g., local residents, NGOs, and local governments), joining
forces across regions to govern watersheds, mountains, and other areas in Taiwan [ 40,41].
Therefore, the concept of Satoumi, deﬁned as “coastal sea-used sustainably in order to
support life of local people” [ 3,6], has been internalized into the sustainable development
strategy for coastal regions of Taiwan.
For residents in the Conservation Priority Group, the government is becoming more
inclusive of the voices of local residents, as evidenced by the launch of community-based
marine conservation programs by the Ocean Conservation Administration. These programs
offer small-sum subsidies as a means of encouraging local communities and organizations
to invest resources in various marine conservation efforts, such as ecosystem restoration,
ocean citizen science, friendly ﬁshing activities, marine conservation promotion, and ocean
clean-up activities. Following the promulgation of the Coastal Zone Management Act
in 2015, the Minister of the Interior initiated a locally integrated coastal management
program aimed at interlinking coastal management and development organizations in
counties and cities to build a local coastal management mechanism in 2019. In 2017, the
Environmental Protection Administration of Executive Yuan established the Taiwan Marine
Debris Management Platform in collaboration with civic environmental organizations.
Each party recognizes the complex nature of marine debris and the limited capability of
a single agency or organization, and feels the urgency of taking environmental actions at
all levels. Therefore, the Environmental Protection Administration united both the private
and public sectors, inviting relevant agencies to engage in discussions and continuously
encourage stakeholders to raise public awareness and support environmental actions to
reduce the generation and impact of marine debris.
In this study, the Industry–Society Priority Group had the largest sample size, which
likely implies that the opinions of this group of people will be mainstream among coastal
residents of Taiwan. Previously, Taiwanese authorities had responded to the Blue Economy
trend during 2015–2018. For example, the Fisheries Agency (afﬁliated to the Council
of Agriculture of Taiwan) launched the Coastal Blue Economy Growth Program [ 42],
adopting community-based sea farming projects to promote ocean productivity and the
economic development of coastal areas [ 8]. With the rise in environmental conservation
awareness, in reality, ﬁshers as a key stakeholder are also asked to join ocean conservation
action networks, compelling them to face trade-offs between catering to the needs of the
ocean and continuing production for their livelihoods, which is associated with increased
ﬁsheries costs due to regulatory restrictions or limited access to resources (e.g., marine
protected areas). This conﬂicts with the productionist orientation of some industrialized
forms of agriculture [ 43]. We should therefore align the attitude of the Industry–Society
Priority Group with that held by the Balanced Development Group or enforce policies and
relevant regulations so that environmental protection and livelihoods are integrated. To
this end, relevant authorities must develop an innovative model that balances the value
of environmental protection and the associated costs, and enables all participants in the
entire system (e.g., ﬁsheries, aquatic products) to understand and provide their support.
Thus, to develop coastal areas, the principle of the wise use of resources [ 44,45] must still
be adhered to when formulating a strategy that secures existing livelihoods and meets
expectations on environmental protection.
Finally, this study examined the mainstream policies implemented by the Taiwanese
government for coastal zone development, and found that Satoumi contents have been
internalized in governmental policies for ﬁsheries, ocean conservation, marine studies,
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 7919 16 of 19
coastal management, and rural development. Locals of coastal communities should be ap-
propriately empowered to learn the Satoumi concept and develop the ability to participate
in decision-making and understand what governmental resources are available. In doing
so, when the socio-ecological sustainability of a place is threatened, then industries, the
government, academia, community residents, and NGOs will have the opportunity to take
collective actions and collaborate to solve predicaments, thereby creating a mechanism that
promotes a bottom-up approach and collaborative governance [ 8,28,41,46]. This process
will help strengthen the SEPLS and community resilience of coastal areas.
6. Conclusions
This study conducted a questionnaire survey of coastal residents in the context of
northeastern Taiwan for investigating the standpoint and perception of residents regarding
Satoumi actions and SDGs to provide suggestions for the formulation of speciﬁc coastal
development strategies. By analyzing the perceptions of Satoumi actions, it was found that
all respondents had a high level of agreement towards Satoumi actions. Furthermore, rank-
ing Satoumi action perceptions demonstrated the residents’ perceived priorities for these
actions in the context of northeastern Taiwan. Through factor analysis, Satoumi actions
were associated with two factors: “Empowerment through community-based industry and
environmental education”, and “Conservation of crucial biological resources and habitats”.
In addition, the SDGs Perceptions dimension consisted of two factors, “Marine socio-
economic sustainability” and “The sustainable use of marine ecological resources”. The
results of cluster analysis showed that three-type stakeholders were identiﬁed according to
their perception toward economic development and ocean conservation. The three groups
were named Industry–Society Priority Group, Conservation Priority Group, and Balanced
Development Group.
Based on Taiwan’s current experience, policies on biodiversity mainstreaming and
sustainability concepts have been implemented in the development of coastal areas. These
policy tools allow stakeholders with various perspectives to have voices and the right to
take action. However, coastal residents in this study still have considerable opinions that
are focused on industries and the society. This ﬁnding echoes the current global trend of
ﬁnding a balance between economic development needs and environmental protection in
coastal zone development [ 47]. Therefore, it is suggested that any policy related to coastal
environmental or economic development should make good use of tools and methods that
encourage stakeholder interaction, dialogue, and consensus-building. Furthermore, future
research should focus on further analyzing various coastal management policy tools to
establish a comprehensive toolkit for sustainable coastal governance.
Finally, given that the 2010–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity failed to halt the trend
of ecological degradation, the United Nations’ COP 15 in 2022 proposed a new global
biodiversity framework that emphasizes the participation of diverse stakeholders in addi-
tion to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity [ 48]. Through the perspective
of local residents, this study revealed that respondents held a high level of agreement
towards various Satoumi actions. The results of the ranking also indicated the urgency of
certain Satoumi actions and identiﬁed measures that have been implemented in the current
context in Taiwan but still require improvement. The Satoumi approach, which emphasizes
conservation and sustainable use of coastal resources without excluding human activities,
requires a holistic concept when applied as an approach to the sustainable governance of
Taiwan’s coastal areas. More efforts need to be invested in to explore the needs of various
stakeholders, and to promote collaboration and coordination among them. Therefore, it is
recommended that the Satoumi concept relies on public–private collaboration to initiate
and sustain its application for sustainable development of coastal SEPLS. It is expected to
provide greater protection for biodiversity and bring about transformative change in society,
toward more sustainable and equitable social, environmental, and economic development.
