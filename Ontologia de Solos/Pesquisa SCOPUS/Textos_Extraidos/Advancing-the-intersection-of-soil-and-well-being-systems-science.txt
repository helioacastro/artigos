Local soil knowledge ABSTRACT  
Innovation for soil research can advance multidimensional outcomes for production and environmental quality 
through consideration of human well-being components. Integrating components from social and soil sciences 
builds the capacity to foster research and innovations that promote human well-being in conjunction with soil 
health. We propose The Integrated Soil Well-being Framework to understand the linkages between individual 
and social well-being related to soil science research and innovation. To facilitate transformative research, we 
present lines of inquiry of human dimensions research that may support well-being outcomes of soil research and 
innovation. We then present opportunities in the area of human dimensions of soil science to innovate ways of 
transformative research that can integrate well-being and soil health: recognizing and fostering a universe of soil 
knowledge, enabling soil connectivity to increase well-being, and evaluating capability. Finally, we propose 
three steps to promote soil and well-being integration: multi-disciplinary soil science training, a normative 
change in the identity of a soil scientist, and diverse methodologies. We aim to create a broader dialogue and 
open the conversation between scholars from various disciplines and methods studying soils to formulate 
research agendas with the advancement of human well-being for soil security.   
Introduction 
In 2015, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization 
celebrated the international year of soils to raise awareness of soil 
degradation. The International Union of Soil Science expanded the effort 
to the decade of soils, 2014-2024, to create an agenda for furthering the 
understanding of human-soil relationships related to protecting soils and 
ensuring soil security (Lal, 2016 ). The critical role that soils play in 
reaching the United Nation ’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has 
continued to raise the importance of soil for supporting global 
well-being (e.g., gender equality, peace, justice, and strong institutions) 
(Bouma and Montanarella, 2019; Lal et al., 2021 ). However, limited 
scholarship within soil research and innovation directly accounts for and 
documents social and cultural co-benefits of soil stewardship (Adhikari 
and Hartemink, 2016 ; Amin et al., 2020 ; Lehmann et al., 2020 ; 
McElwee, 2021 ). In particular, individual and societal well-being have 
received little attention from the soils literature (McElwee, 2021 ). This 
gap in the literature is mainly attributed to the shift in agricultural 
research paradigms since the Green Revolution. The outcome of the 
focus of agricultural research has shifted from first focusing on pro-
ducing more food than on improving environmental quality, and recently to positively supporting social processes and impacts. With the 
shift from conservation- to sustainability-focused research in conjunc -
tion with the rise of the transformative paradigm in agricultural 
research, soil science needs to begin focusing on multidimensional 
research outcomes to include human and societal well-being. This article 
aims to  
≡Propose The Integrated Soil Well-being Framework, which provides 
common language and unifies existing human-soil frameworks to 
facilitate communication on well-being outcomes of soil research 
and innovations.  
≡Advance the transformative soil science process by identifying 
human diemensions of soil science research lines that contribute to 
human and community well-being outcomes.  
≡Identify emerging action areas where transformative research can 
integrate advancement of well-being and soil health. 
The article prompts interested scholars in the field for dialogue 
among transdisciplinary scientists on how to enhance human-soil re-
lationships and contribute to individual and social well-being outcomes 
of soil science innovations.

2The intersection of soil health and well-being 
Soil influences society and, in turn, is created by society (Krzy-
woszynska and Marchesi, 2019 ). Soil and human health efforts promote 
the connections between human physical health and soil with the aim to 
increase societal awareness and perceived value of soil (food nutrition, 
nutrition deficiency, disease, toxicity, gut-microbial diversity, etc.) 
(Oliver, 1997 ). However, synergies between soil health and subjective 
elements of well-being remain poorly articulated across the soil science 
literature (McElwee, 2021 ). 
Human subjective well-being or quality of life within the eudaimonic 
western perspective is the state of living life fully and meaningfully 
(Deci and Ryan, 2008 ). The field of political ecology has documented the 
interrelationships between soil degradation and well-being reflected in 
global patterns of social, political, and economic conditions that create 
exploitative pressures on the soil’s condition reducing soil’s function -
ality (Andersson et al., 2011 ). Preliminary research has documented the 
link between sustainable soil management and its relationship with the 
producer ’s well-being. For example, wheat producers in the Pacific 
Northwest of the United States perceived soil health management as 
supporting their well-being through creativity and learning, decreased 
dependency on agricultural inputs, dignity for their livelihood and 
respect within the agricultural community, connectedness to nature and 
their community, and improved mental and physical health with 
reduced synthetic pesticide usage (Friedrichsen et al., 2021 ). Perceived 
relationships between well-being and soil health outcomes are 
culturally-dependent (Stronge et al., 2020 ). Integrated Soil Well-being Framework 
The Integrated Soil Well-being Framework that we propose here 
establishes a vocabulary and unifies existing human-soil frameworks to 
understand how to promote well-being through soil sciences (Figure 1). 
The framework facilitates transformative research across biophysical 
and social sciences by creating common terminology,delineating the 
knowledge gap and solution of focus in order to facilitate communica -
tion across disciplines (von Wehrden et al., 2019 ). Several human-soil 
frameworks exist to examine the relationships between biophysical 
and social components of soil systems related to soil stewardship: 
ecosystem services, soil security, and nature ’s contribution to people 
(Adhikari and Hartemink, 2016 ; McBratney et al., 2014 ; McElwee, 
2021 ). Within the soil ecosystem services framework, as articulated by 
Adhikari and Hartemink (2016) , human well-being outcomes of soil are 
often only perceived as cultural ecosystem services (art, storing 
geological and archaeological artifacts) and providing material needs 
(food, clothing, shelter, human health). Soil security identifies specific 
system components and processes (i.e., condition, capital, connectivity, 
condition, and capability) that drive soil care and soil threats (McBrat -
ney et al., 2014 ). Limitations with the soil security framework are its 
focus on protecting the soil. Neither of these frameworks conceptualizes 
intangible benefits of soil stewardship, such as subjective well-being or 
community well-being. Nature ’s contribution to people does include 
social-cultural co-benefits of human-soil relationships or non-material 
values derived from the soil. These include learning and inspiration, 
physical and physical experiences, and supporting identities (McElwee, 
2021 ). 
Transformative research addresses the root causes of challenges 
Figure 1.The Integrated Soil and Well-being Framework. The figure was adapted from the Bentley Brymer et al. (2020) integrated framework by focusing on soil 
research and innovation as the driver of change to the social and biophysical soil security dimensions (McBratney et al., 2014 ), which underlie processes that either 
benefit or degrade individual well-being (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003 ), social well-being (Wilkinson, 1991 ), and soil health. C.N. Friedrichsen et al.

3within complex adaptive systems and creates new futures that syner -
gistically address improved human and environmental well-being 
(Herrero et al., 2020 ; Hubeau et al., 2017 ). The Integrated Soil 
Well-Being Framework is proposed to facilitate transformative soil sci-
ence research by integrating existing human-soil relationship frame -
works to provide a common language for scientists from diverse 
disciplinary backgrounds to communicate with one another. 
The Integrated Soil Well-Being Framework examines how an inter-
vention such as soil science research and innovation can either benefit or 
degrade soil health and individual and social well-being by disrupting 
the dynamic interrelationship between humans and soil processes, im-
pacts, and functions. The Integrated Soil Well-being Framework in-
tegrates components of the Integrated Agroecosystem framework 
(Bentley Brymer et al. 2020 ), Soil Security (McBratney et al., 2014 ), and 
Nature ’s Contribution to People (Díaz et al., 2018 ) frameworks. The 
Integrated Soil Well-Being Framework recognizes that soil is a system 
consisting of biophysical and social components driven by ecological 
and social processes that support individual, social, and ecosystem 
health. 
The Integrated Soil Well-being Framework then represents the 
reciprocal relationship between soil security and well-being. Well-being 
is then conceptualized into three interrelated social-ecological states: 
individual and community well-being and soil health. Supporting the 
Janzen et al., (2021) definition, “Soil health is the vitality of a soil in 
sustaining the socio-ecological functions of its enfolding land. ” 
Advancing transformative soil science 
Transformative efforts integrating natural and social sciences are 
necessary to foster soil science innovation to support well-being out-
comes (Janzen et al., 2021 ). As soil science shifts its focus to answer 
complex, adaptive systems management, the transformative capacity of 
the field will also expand. Most often, soil science research and inno-
vation characterizes social science as providing a unique outreach 
function to encourage the adoption of innovation through extension and 
education (Hou et al., 2020 ; Klerkx et al., 2012 ). However, when applied 
effectively, social science provides new tools to advance innovation 
within soil science to synergistically advance human and environmental 
well-being (Meredith et al., 2021 ). Examples of social science lines of 
inquiry and methodologies that can advance soil research and innova -
tion at each step of the research and innovation process for and 
contribute to well-being outcomes are found in Table 1. 
In the sections below, three priority transdisciplinary topic areas are 
highlighted, where the application of human dimensions can advance 
soil science to achieve well-being outcomes of soil management. Recognizing and fostering a diversity of soil knowledge 
An important area in which social sciences can greatly support well- 
being outcomes of soil science occurs through recognizing and fostering 
a diversity of soil knowledge and ways of knowing. Colonization led to 
western science privilege, domination, and knowledge genocide erasing 
many forms of soil knowledge (Pena, 2017 ). The discipline of ethno -
pedology highlights the diversity of local and indigenous soil classifi -
cations and taxonomies (Barrera-Bassols and Zinck, 2003 ). Soil science 
has homogenized our soil management, recognizing a limited breadth of 
acceptable norms for soil stewardship (conventional, conservation, 
organic, permaculture, and biodynamic) (Marchesi, 2020 ). 
Local soil knowledge, once seen as something to be observed, 
documented, and validated against scientific knowledge, has now shif-
ted towards promoting co-innovation and integration of local soil 
knowledge within the research process (Huynh et al., 2020 ). Culturally 
responsive science recognizes multiple ways of knowing, knowledge 
creation processes, and knowledge transmission. It also builds knowl -
edge that fosters culture and well-being (Stephens, 2001 ). Stronge et al., 
(2020) developed a soil well-being framework shaped from the Te Ao 
Mßaori ( Mßaori world view) in Aotearoa New Zealand. The framework 
outlines the interconnections between soil values, threats, policy, and 
monitoring supporting well-being and highlights the importance of how 
one’s group ’s well-being should not be priviledged over the well-being 
of anothers. 
Much of the knowledge integration in the current soil science liter-
ature focuses on soil fertility, yield, or soil health indices (˘Alvarez et al., 
2021 ; Nath et al., 2016 ). Broadening the scope of local soil knowledge to 
include intangible material outcomes of soil stewardship provides a 
more comprehensive understanding, promotes diverse knowledge sys-
tems, and nourishes cultures, communities, and individuals (Stronge 
et al., 2020 ). For example, in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Hua Parakore 
framework is centered around the Te AoM ßaori of the interconnectedness 
between soil health and human well-being (Hutchings et al., 2018 ). 
Instead of research being a process of homogenizing and globalizing soil 
knowledge, prioritizing the integration of social science ontologies, 
methodologies, and epistemologies into the research process could 
support cultural diversity through identity expression (e.g., local soil 
management techniques, art, religious expression) (McElwee, 2021 ). 
Fostering soil connectivity to increase well-being 
Integrating social sciences within the research process can facilitate 
inquiry that promotes people ’s connection to the soil as the physical 
resource they steward. Soil connectivity is the emotional cognizance or 
the perceived importance between an individual or society and the soil. 
Human-nature connectivity exists as a dimension of well-being (Mil-
lennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003 ). As knowledge of soil health 
continues to grow, so does the potential ability to value soil’s capital by 
identifying diverse ways people connect with soil and value it. We 
currently have a limited conceptualization of societal values of soil 
based upon economic value such as carbon markets and soil production 
capacity. Compared to other resources, soil’s value is mainly commu -
nicated and defined through the soil’s ability to provide fertility through 
net profit and yield (Tironi et al., 2020 ). Social science contributions 
facilitate understanding and knowledge of diverse experiences of 
connection to soil and soil valuation (Janzen et al., 2021 ). An emphasis 
on awareness, appreciation, and connectedness to soil through educa -
tion is one step towards improving valuation of soil by society (Lal et al., 
2021 ). However, facilitating societal behavior change to increase 
connection to soil and soil-awarded value will require more than 
education. 
Behavior change theories provide insight into encouraging soil 
stewardship behavior. For example, Ericson et al., (2014) hypothesize 
the link between mindfulness practices, values, empathy, compassion, 
well-being, and pro-environmental behavior. Social science may help Table 1

4apply and build social theories to understand how connection to soil and 
connection to humans as organisms can be fostered and measured, and 
which actors and connections are privileged or exploited (Puig de la 
Bellacasa, 2015; Tironi et al., 2020). Smith (2004) found that cultivating 
soil care in youth in Portland, Oregon, resulted in the promotion of other 
caring behaviors that promote societal well-being. Application of game 
theory to agriculture to understand how individuals process information 
and make decisions, which may be applied for soil science (Hernande -
z-Aguilera et al., 2020), provides another example of using social theory 
to inform multidimensional soil security outcomes. 
Knowledge of how consumers value and connect to soil beyond the 
over-simplified food dichotomy of organic vs. conventional remains 
limited. Little information is known on how to change consumers’ 
behavior to generate value for soil health, especially related to what 
matters, identities, and motivations that underlie consumptive behavior. 
The concept of terroir within viticulture has given aesthetic, and intrinsic 
value to soil but has had relatively little success in increasing soil’s value 
within other agronomic sectors. Currently, soil carbon markets are 
receiving attention as a possible means for providing an alternative 
mechanism to provide value to producers for caring for their soil beyond 
production yield. Soil carbon markets provide a way for consumers to 
directly measure their connection to the soil through their consumptive 
behavior (Tironi et al., 2020). Expanding and emphasizing trans -
disciplinary research that supports various ways consumers could 
develop multiple values for soil health may facilitate broader outcomes 
of human and society well-being. 
Evaluating soil capability 
What is the capability of soil to support human and societal well- 
being? Soil capacity is what soil can theoretically do in a standard -
ized/controlled environment; Soil capability is what soil can do within 
the context of its embedded social-ecological system (Holsbeeke et al., 
2009). Pedo-econometrics and biocultural indicator approaches may be 
useful to understanding soil’s capability to support individual and 
community well-being within specific social-ecological systems. 
Pedo-econometrics, the integration of quantitative economic meth -
odologies with soil science, creates new opportunities for determining 
soils’ capability by accounting for social drivers and outcomes of soil 
management (Bouma et al., 2012; Field, 2017; Mizuta et al., 2021). For 
example, Mizuta et al. (2019) applied the economic methodology of 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to elaborate on how to improve the 
measured soil performance and achievable soil capability. In addition, 
DEA and other economic methods can provide a set of data-driven 
reference points/lines/multi-spheres without arranging “control” treat-
ment, which would be extremely useful to evaluate the capacity and 
capability of soil in various environmental-human circumstances. 
Biocultural indicator approaches, such as participatory research, 
provide culturally grounded perspectives on developing metrics and 
evaluation of well-being. Specifically, biocultural indicator approaches 
incorporate placed-based values and knowledge of holistic systems 
capturing the social and ecological feedback loops and non-material 
outcomes of soil’s capability to support well-being (Sterling et al., 
2017). For example, semi-structured interviews with producers in the 
African highlands identified the presence of weeds as an indicator of soil 
health (Eze et al., 2021). 
Building soil research and innovation capacity 
Soil science is traditionally defined as a set of acceptable chemical, 
physical and biological methodologies. In order to support trans -
formative soil science, research soil science needs to be no longer 
defined by a list of acceptable methods but by the topic of soil (Morgan 
and McBratney, 2020). A shift in the discipline of soil science towards a 
transdisciplinary collaborative effort that promotes human and societal 
well-being will require concerted effort and change in soil science training, a normative change in the identity of who is a soil scientist, and 
normative acceptance of diverse methodologies. 
For example, currently in the United States, the federal government’s 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) does not recognize any social 
science courses as contributing to the qualification of working as a soil 
scientist. Coursework qualifications to be a soil scientist include “30 
semester hours or equivalent in biological, physical, or earth science, 
with a minimum of 15 semester hours in such subjects as soil genesis, 
pedology, soil chemistry, soil physics, and soil fertility” (Office of 
Personnel Management, 2020). To meet the demands of industry, soil 
science graduates will need to have the capacity to think and collaborate 
on a systems level and identify problems and challenges to address 
soil-related issues beyond concentrations of the biophysical space 
(Bouma, 2001). Soil science students in Australia identified key learning 
priorities including systems knowledge that spans social and economic 
contexts at various scales (Field et al., 2011). 
Transdisciplinary soil research that fosters well-being may be further 
facilitated by broadening the scope of the identity of what a soil scientist 
does, broadening training to include human dimensions, and promoting 
transdisciplinary scholarship. The identity of being a ‘soil scientist’ 
needs to be inclusive of individuals from diverse backgrounds, ways of 
knowing, knowledge belief systems, epistemologies, and methodologies 
that contribute to soil innovation. This could be achieved through pro-
fessional recognition, and respect for the diversity of scientific skillsets 
within soil science. The discipline of soil science benefits from inclusive 
approaches, as with any large organizational endeavor. This normative 
perspective differs from historical patterns that have shown pro-
fessionals using diverse methods and epistemologies often face system -
atic disenfranchisement within what it means to belong, associate, and 
participate in the collective. For instance, diverse approaches or per-
spectives in soil science may lead to exclusion from standard academic 
roles such as opportunities for engagement within professional organi -
zations, textbook creation responsibilities, and curriculum design within 
university departments. 
A disciplinary inclusion of the study of humans should be acknowl -
edged not as disrupters to the ecological system but as an integrated 
essential part to the socio-ecological systems (Puig de la Bellacasa, 
2015). The breadth of disciplines needed to foster soil security includes, 
but is not limited to food and culture studies, sociology, anthropology, 
law, political science, economics, conservation psychology, and geog-
raphy. New skillsets to tackle diverse data sets, axiologies, methodolo -
gies, and epistemologies will be the foundation of the training. 
Expanding the breadth of soil science will require creating space and 
opportunities for new scholars to flourish founded in understanding and 
respect for diverse epistemologies and methodologies. Fostering new 
sub-disciplines of soil knowledge that stem from human dimensions of 
soil will foster a broader understanding of human-soil relationships and 
how to support soil, human, and societal well-being synergistically. 
In the context of soil science, collaboration across diverse method -
ological and epistemological backgrounds needs recognition as a valued 
and meaningful process. The transdisciplinary scholarship will require 
reflection on recognizing and accounting for disciplinary impact and 
career development through our current scientific reward systems. 
Interdisciplinary journals with diversely trained editors and reviewers 
who can make informed decisions and informed peer reviews within 
their skillset and topic of knowledge will provide high-quality research 
and innovation. New methods, data sources, and collaborations will fuel 
a paradigm shift in soil science to be inclusive of human well-being 
outcomes. 
Through our effort here, we support a broader call to action: diverse 
scholars globally applying social science methods, epistemologies, and 
ontologies to outline research priorities to advance well-being outcomes 
from soil science. C.N. Friedrichsen et al.
