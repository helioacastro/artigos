Space ABSTRACT  
Laundering activities enact a range of socio-material relations and spatialisation of infrastructures such as pro-
vision of machines, water, energy, laundry and lately digitalisation. Drawing on a case study on communal 
laundry facilities in Sweden, this paper focuses on socio-material relations and explores laundry practices in 
Swedish rental housing, aiming for a theoretical contribution in the field of care, which could incorporate spatial 
and temporal aspects to be more inclusive. Theoretically based in topologies of power, with sensitivity to pro-
cesses of spatialisation and temporalities, the analyses show how decisions about design, space and technologies 
influence everyday life of tenants. The paper illuminates how availability and access to laundry facilities were 
conformed and individualised to reach expected standards. Laundry spaces were subject to digitalisation and 
automation technologies introduced to meet efficiency and environmental demands and handle perceived 
problematic tenant practices. Conclusions are that relational materialism in the field of care and scripting pro-
cesses would benefit from explicitly including theoretical thinking about space and temporality, conceptualised 
as choreography. The approach “thinking with care” brought backgrounded laundering phenomena to the fore 
and pointed out laundering as a matter we should care about. Digitalisation and automation facilitated control of 
shared laundry spaces and ambitions to individualise laundry made private spaces, such as bathrooms, more 
attractive to host laundering activities but backgrounded social dimensions of communal laundering.   
1.Introduction 
Material infrastructures and technologies of homes and their con-
nections to systems for provision and associated organisations have been 
described as hybrids (Shove, 2018 ) and parts of scripting processes 
(Akrich, 1992 ) to programme objects to perform activities in certain 
ways. Hybrids and scripts are not neutral or unbiased but loaded with 
norms, values and ideas about how daily life should be performed and fit 
into existing power networks. Strengers (2009) , drawing on Akrich 
(1992) , gives the example of a washing machine which scripts “a range 
of methods or ‘cycles ’ used to produce appropriate clean laundry ” 
(Strengers, 2009, p. 45). When Shove (2003) studied laundering as a 
part of social practices of cleanliness and convenience in homes, she 
highlighted the influence laundry technologies have on our everyday 
lives, both the activities we perform and our own understandings of 
what clean and dirty laundry means. The practices we take for granted in 
quotidian life should continuously be scrutinised to illuminate what 
power is present and how it works in the mundane. When spatial and 
temporal dimensions are part of a framework designed to analyse power, the analysis might give a more inclusive and diverse picture of how 
power is imbued in everyday activities. 
In this paper power is understood as topological (Murdoch, 2006, 
Allen, 2016 ) which implies “… quieter registers of power […] often 
holding together formations that can be used to influence the will or 
shape of others …” (Allen, 2016, p 2). As our material world changes and 
relations between humans and non-humans change, power continues to 
be a key element, but might take new shapes and forms and might be 
executed from a distance. To explore these new shapes and forms and 
how power find reach in the mundane, an everyday activity like laun-
dering could be examined in more detail. In the centre of the present 
research is theoretical understandings of care (Mol, 2002, 2008; Buse 
et al., 2018 ). In human geography care has been acknowledged in aca-
demic work on space and relationships in care situations (Milligan, 
2001; Conradson, 2003a; Conradson, 2003b; Bowlby, 2012; Munro, 
2013; Bowlby and McKie, 2019 ). The lion’s share of this research has 
elucidated care as activities involving people ’s work at home and in 
different organisations taking care of other people, for example health 
and social care as informal or formal activities. Care in the present paper

172is conceptually guided by the writings of Mol (2008) and Law (2010) 
and understood as “a set of materially heterogenous practices involving 
not simply particular kinds of subjectivities, but also instruments, and 
technologies together with other material elements, texts and in-
scriptions” (Law, 2010, pp. 66-67). Mol (2008) discussed care practices 
in detail in her seminal work “The Logic of Care: Health and the Problem 
of Patient Choice”. Care practices in a health service context might be 
more self-evident, but the idea of directing attention to the doings of 
those involved in care practices and the shared responsibility of all 
involved parties to “experiment, experience and tinker together – 
practically” (Mol, 2008, p. 65) could be applied more generally in socio- 
material research. In contrast, we can think of technology and pre-
defined fixed instructions predetermining how to perform a specific 
task, without considering all possible variations in practices. Topologies 
have previously been part of scholarly work in “matters of care” (Law 
and Mol, 2001), but this paper suggests that thinking about power, space 
and time more explicitly in power topologies, as suggested by human 
geographers (cf. Murdoch, 2006, Allen, 2016), could advance the aca-
demic field of care. 
With this theoretical foundation, care for laundering is in focus as a 
socio-material spatiality, enacting practices and relationships in laun-
dering. When care practices are foregrounded in Swedish rental housing 
laundry work the boundaries between private and public are blurred and 
crossed. A tenant using communal laundry facilities in Sweden does it 
partly in private, partly as a member of a collective of tenants in a block 
of flats with certain responsibilities and expectations, for example: 
leaving the facilities in the state you would like to find them (Lund, 
2009, 2011). This approach highlights the many different versions of 
laundering that are present when subjects and objects are enacted, as 
various fabrics such as clothes, towels and linen are managed as laundry 
in and around homes. 
The involved practices of laundering create relationships between 
the involved subjects, objects and spaces, which could all be understood 
as multiple and fluid, and in constant making (Waitt and Welland, 
2019). The relationships are also part of topologies of power (cf. Mur-
doch, 2006, Allen, 2016) which make power reach into daily life from a 
distance. The constant making of relationships and their integration 
with topologies of power constitute the overarching research interests in 
this paper. The aim is partly empirical and to explore laundry practices 
in Swedish rental housing and partly aiming for a theoretical contribu -
tion in the field of care, which could incorporate spatial and temporal 
aspects to be more inclusive. 
2.Background 
Shove (2003) suggested that laundering consists of materialised 
cleanliness which holds “moral, social and symbolic meanings” (p. 119). 
Drawing on Strasser (1982) and taking a historical perspective, laun-
dering has according to Shove (2003) increasingly become a matter of 
household devices and products, resulting in a “corporate grip on the 
meaning of cleaning, […] within the heart of the home” (Shove, 2003, p. 
121). The Swedish situation, historically influenced by a strong welfare 
state combined with recent influences of neo-liberalism in several sec-
tors, shows similarities to the British case as described by Shove (2003), 
the situation in the U.S. (Strasser, 1982) and Australia (Waitt and 
Welland, 2019). Laundering in Sweden is strongly associated with 
housing, which is a concern both for Swedish municipalities providing 
rental housing with laundry facilities within their geographical juris-
diction, and private developers and property owners who provide 
housing and laundering based on demand. Laundry appliances and 
consumer goods such as detergents are sold and bought on the regular 
consumer market. 
Tenants’ access to communal laundry rooms and facilities in Sweden 
have at least partly slowed down the processes of making laundering 
largely a corporate business. Municipal housing companies, and also 
private housing owners and co-operative housing associations, have in many cases provided communal laundry rooms and separate laundry 
buildings in backyards or courtyards. These spaces particularly dedi-
cated to washing and drying of household fabrics hold certain materi -
alisations and spatialisations of cleanliness, as defined and expected by 
the property owner, be it municipal, private or co-operative associa -
tions. Care for laundering in this example includes cleaning the 
communal laundry space, removing fluff from the tumble drier and 
wiping the washing machines clean when you are done with your 
laundry. Berner (1998) traced the historical processes in Sweden leading 
to the current situation and claimed “a preoccupation with one’s own 
home, its planning, construction, and furnishing, underwent an expan -
sive growth around the turn of the [20th] century” (p. 319). The re-
sponsibility was directed towards Swedish housewives and a programme 
based on aesthetic, moral and hygienic values was rolled out. Spatial and 
temporal organisation was part of the programme, and the ordering of 
things and everything in its place dominated the message from 
authorities. 
Shove (2003) proposed a model of “systems of systems” to describe 
how households manage their laundry and fix issues related to laun-
dering, while simultaneously manufacturers and producers of goods and 
services in the “laundering business”, such as household detergent, and 
fabric and textile industries are trying to develop their products, find 
new markets and win shares of markets. Taken together, laundering 
involves many different people, social groups and organisations acting 
on different levels of respective systems. In Sweden, the housing com-
panies and landlords providing facilities for laundering offer yet another 
interest group, managing laundering and using different means of con-
trol to influence how laundering is performed by households. Housing 
companies and property owners thus have their own “system” within the 
meta-system of laundering, making the co-production of laundering 
more complex in the Swedish case. 
Allon and Sofoulis (2006), Heynen et al. (2006), Mee et al. (2014) 
investigated rental housing, the socio-material configurations of systems 
for provision, use of resources and how these entities, relations and 
flows shape urban space. Owner-occupied housing is a more common 
empirical focus in research, but rental housing could elucidate issues 
related to justice, vulnerability and expectations on people in homes, in 
which they have little or no possibilities to influence the material 
standard. Mee (2009) acknowledged tenants as resourceful, skilful and 
able to care for their homes, but often constrained by the tenure in their 
actions. Tenants are connected to systems of provisions via various in-
terfaces at home: power plugs, pipes and drains, meters and bills, and 
can often enjoy the convenience and comfort of what might seem to be 
an endless supply of water, electricity, gas, etc (Sofoulis, 2005). But the 
power to design, construct, manage, repair and redesign the system of 
provision is not in the hands of renters. Nor are the goods and services 
around these systems, such as water, electricity, gas, heating, but these 
elements are: 
“critical dimension[s] to the social production of space […implying] 
a series of connectivities between the body and the city, between 
social and bio-physical systems, between the evolution of […] net-
works and capital flows, and between the visible and invisible di-
mensions to urban space.” (Gandy, 2004, p. 373) 
Rental housing is connected to systems that might make everyday 
life both easier and more difficult for tenants, depending on individual 
prerequisites and circumstances, but many parts of the system are acting 
from a distance and out of their control (cf. Allen, 2016). Communal 
laundry facilities that are shared by neighbours in the same building or 
same block of apartments are central features in Swedish rented flats, 
which make up almost one third of all housing in Sweden. The provision 
of modern washing and drying equipment in Swedish public housing 
evolved parallel to other household work and comfort-related facilities, 
such as kitchens and central heating (Berner, 2002). The Swedish wel-
fare model and the political vision of “peoples’ home” were manifested W. Glad

173by a Swedish prime minister in the 1930 ’s and put into policy over the 
following decades. Washing and drying facilities to enable laundering 
are included in the rent and usually not billed separately or charged by 
number of uses. Access to the laundry facilities is managed by self- 
serviced booking systems that are designed to divide laundering slots 
equally between tenants. Compared to consumer laundering white 
goods, such as washing machines and tumble dryers, the equipment in 
communal laundering spaces has an industrial design to manage many 
washing and drying cycles every day. The cycles are shorter than con-
sumer white goods and the economic incentives to reduce water and 
energy demand lie primarily with the property owner. 
3.Understanding laundering as matters of care in topological 
space 
Relational approaches to the description and analysis of power have 
become predominant in many academic fields, including human geog-
raphy. The relationships, interconnections, links and ties are all 
important in our efforts to understand how and why different phe-
nomena are present or absent the way they are. Relationality also calls 
for a certain view on power, “as a dynamic web of interconnections ” 
(Braidotti, 2006, p. 199). An analysis about how these dynamics find 
balance, or move and change, will show what is enacted, brought into 
the web or pushed out. Mol (2002) proposes a research approach 
focused on phenomena as “multiple ”, highlighting that different “ver-
sions ” could be present at the same time. According to Mol (2002) , 
“enactments ” of different versions should be the centre of attention in 
research, along with the processes that bring some versions to the fore 
and render some absent. Significant for these relations are heterogeneity 
and fluidity. 
The specific concept care is selected as part of the analytical frame -
work to guide our understanding of communal laundering and power 
relationships. In recent decades, care has been found relevant in ex-
plorations of clinics and homes, for example (Mol et al., 2010 ), and is 
part of: 
“a feminist approach that engages with care as a way to draw 
attention to the significance of practices and experiences made 
invisible or marginalized by dominant, ‘successful ’, forms of tech-
noscientific mobilization ” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015, p 692). 
Laundering could serve as an example of how technologies such as 
electronics and mechanical parts of a washing machine are acknowl -
edged in supranational directives about product design and energy ef-
ficiency, or chemicals in detergents and fabric conditioners are subject 
to environmental protection management, labelling and legislation (cf. 
Eidenskog, 2015 ). The work, time and effort involved in doing the 
laundry, which were among the motives behind the inventions of 
washing machines and tumble dryers, are not as visible in the current 
public debates, but still present in people ’s everyday lives (cf. Schwartz 
Cowan, 1983, 1999 ). Care as an inclusive analytical concept could help 
us shed light on how subjects and objects are enacted and brought into 
the power web of communal laundering. 
Even if care has been found rewarding as a research approach and 
concept to explore together with empirical material, care has also been 
criticised for the broadness and lack of concept definition (Mol et al., 
2011 ). Could anything be analysed as care? Where and why is care 
present? In a response to the objections about how care has been pre-
sented and used in research, Mol et al. (2011) replied: 
“[…] we sought to ask a how-questions: how is ‘care ’ being done? 
Which modes and modalities of ‘caring ’ may we trace in various 
practices? How can each of these, different as they are, shed light on 
and help to specify the others? Or, in other words, […] ‘care ’ [is] a 
verb, and not a noun. ” (Mol et al., 2011, p. 84). 
In earlier work, Mol and Law (1994; Law and Mol, 2001 ) connected their own stance in science and technology studies (STS) based in 
philosophical process ontology, to ideas about space and spatiality in 
human geography. Mol and Law (1994) introduced a topology consist -
ing of fluid space in which human and non-human entities are in constant 
movement and change, becoming entanglements and forming socio- 
material spatialisations. Fluid space and fluid spatiality were sug-
gested as concepts to capture topological space in a version where 
connections and shape change gradually and incrementally. Thus, 
transformation is constant and “the associations or forms of attachment 
shift and move, but they do so in a way that also allows the performance 
of continuity ” (Law and Mol, 2001, p. 614) – creating stability and 
amendments simultaneously. Law and Mol (2001) also introduced fire 
space – elaborated by Law and Singleton (2005) – for exploring entities 
“in the form of a dancing and dangerous pattern of discontinuous dis-
placements between locations that are other to (but linked with) each 
other ” (Law and Singleton, 2005, p. 347). In fire space, the continuity of 
shapes and forms is defined by discontinuity and different versions in 
other places. This notion is connected to how fire space makes different 
versions of entities present and central, and other versions absent, while 
still influencing central entities ’ multiple juxtapositions (Wittock et al., 
2017 ). The question of how different versions of phenomena are made 
present or absent has previously been empirically explored by, for 
example, Kortelainen (2010) , Eidenskog (2015) and Lind˘en (2016) . 
The relational materialism as presented by Mol and Law (1994) and 
Ingold (2008) stressed relations as not only connection points, but flows 
creating something qualitatively different. A clothing item, for example, 
is constantly degraded and broken down by chemical processes in the 
air, by the sun and in the water, when being washed or soaked, and when 
in contact with human bodies and other non-human entities. The item ’s 
relations to bodies and other entities entail mixing of shapes and smells, 
thus changing the clothing ’s value from one laundry category – clean, to 
another – dirty. 
Care illuminates the interdependencies of entities as part of re-
lationships in everyday activities. The experiences of these in-
terdependencies should be brought to the fore and acknowledged for 
their embodiment, situatedness and temporality, making materiality 
and space –time relevant to explore as they are articulated and practised 
(cf. Haraway, 1997; Mol, 2008; Bowlby, 2012 ). Munro (2013) and 
Morse and Munro (2018) explored museums as “spaces of care” and 
suggested that everyday practices performed by museum staff, material 
entities and space could be viewed as care. Buse et al. (2018) illuminated 
laundry, building design and architecture in care homes and connected 
space and time in a study about laundry “[…] flows, movement, and 
standards – creating a choreography of laundry. ” (p. 712). Choreogra -
phy thus conceptualises the temporalities and spatialisation of laun-
dering and provides an understanding about how doing the laundry 
could be viewed as a prescribed dance. 
The analytical approach in the present paper builds primarily on 
relational materialism, as proposed by Law and Mol (1995) and Mol 
(2002) , suggesting an analytical focus on how, what, when and why 
entities are enacted in different care practices and how they are per-
formed in different choreographies. Another layer is the take on power, 
inspired by topologies of power (Allen, 2016 ) where power could be 
fairly silent, but still present and influencing everyday life. A third layer 
in the analyses is fluid and fire topological space (Mol and Law, 1994; 
Law and Mol, 2001 ), to elucidate spatiality, entities and relations made 
present or absent in laundering power and care. 
4.Previous research 
Practice theory-inspired research on laundering is prevalent in aca-
demic literature on washing and drying of clothes, towels, bed linen and 
other fabrics found in homes (Shove, 2003; Verbeek; 2006; Strengers, 
2009; Browne, 2016; Jack, 2018 ). Shove (2003) explored “doing the 
laundry ” from the perspective of different individuals and her starting 
point was the increase in frequency for how many times people washed W. Glad

174clothes and linen. Households in Great Britain and the USA had tripled 
the number of times they did the laundry since the 1950 ’s. The socio- 
material practices of today have made doing the laundry more acces -
sible, with washing and drying machines in homes, machines that are 
relatively quiet, quicker, come in different sizes to fit into different 
spaces at home, and are more energy and water efficient. At the same 
time, doing the laundry has become more complex with a general in-
crease in ownership of apparel, of different materials that require 
different washing temperatures and cycles. Pink et al. (2017) argued 
that social practice theory has a set and predetermined research 
approach and might overlook interesting and important empirical data, 
analysis and understandings of a phenomenon. Pink et al. (2017) , 
guided by for example social anthropology, material cultures studies and 
phenomenological anthropology, preferred an open-ended research 
approach focused on temporalities, environments and activities as 
fundamental elements of everyday life at home. Informants in the 
research projects were perceived as participants, inventors and impro -
visers of diverse, different, ambiguous and destabilising laundry prac-
tices (Pink, 2005 ). Pink (2012) suggested laundry and laundering as 
being elements of “sensory home ”, where home is partly (re)constituted 
by how fabrics feel, look, smell and are managed at home – how they are 
laundered, dried on radiators, ironed, aired and stored in different parts 
of the home depending on whether they are categorised as clean or dirty, 
wet or dry, creased or smooth - in a constant “laundry flow ” (Pink, 2012, 
p 70). 
Schwartz Cowan (1983), Berner (1998) and Jack (2012, 2017, 2018) 
have highlighted the relationships between women, homes and clean -
liness. Dirt and dust have historically been connected to bacteria that are 
able to enter the body and develop illness and it became the re-
sponsibility of women to look after the family and keep discomfort away 
from the home by washing and cleaning (Berner, 1998 ). Technologies 
like washing machines and vacuum cleaners, in combination with 
changing norms, have escalated the demand for cleanliness and resulted 
in more domestic duties for women (Schwartz Cowan, 1983 ). Laundry, 
in particular, has been kept as a female domain in Sweden, where 
women on average spend three times as many hours on taking care of 
clothes, towels and linen at home than men in Sweden (Jack, 2017 ). 
Several authors in the empirical field of cleanliness at home related 
their research to sustainability and use of resources such as energy and 
water (Shove, 2003, Gram-Hanssen, 2008; Strengers, 2009, Jack, 2018 ) 
or climate change issues (Mee et al., 2014 ), and their own critical stance 
towards how domestic routines, habits, conventions and practices were 
established within the sustainable development discourse. Embedded in 
this discourse are also powerful norms and values about how to use 
modest measures and reformative politics to slowly change the direction 
of our use of resources. Swedish households are part of these politics and 
households are often viewed by both local and national governments as 
a place or platform for sustainable development, where policies are 
expected to be enacted and create change. Current research not only 
questions the commercial influences of cleanliness and laundry con-
ventions, but also the politics and measures directed towards individuals 
and households. Are individuals and households to blame for the current 
negative environmental and climate situations? Who should feel 
responsible, and who should take action? (Bradley, 2009 ). 
Communal laundry facilities that are shared in a block of flats or the 
immediate neighbourhood are not unique to Sweden, but have also been 
constructed in, for example, Australia (Waitt and Nowroozipour, 2020 ). 
Care for these common facilities has been highlighted as an issue, and 
lack of care evoked emotions of frustration and disgust over “dirty and 
messy materialities of the communal laundry ” (Waitt and Now-
roozipour, 2020 , p. 14). Washing machines could be perceived as 
holders and carriers of dirt residues and germs from other people ’s 
clothing and bodies. Waitt and Nowroozipour (2020) suggested “doing 
[…] washing in the communal laundry a space of assembling, becoming, 
differentiating and diverging ” (p 14) and in their Australian study not a 
pleasant experience but rather an activity tenants avoided, if options like washing clothes and linen at home was available. Similarly, communal 
laundering in Sweden has also contained identity work and the estab -
lishment of ties between people in a neighbourhood (Henning and 
Lovgren, 2002; Henning et al., 2015 ). But in addition to what tenants 
experienced in Australia, communal laundering in Sweden was pre-
sented as both “an important arena for neighbourly interactions ” and “a 
classic source of conflict ” (Henning and Lovgren, 2002 , p. 63). In the 
study by Henning and Lovgren (2002) some tenants pointed at “for-
eigners ” and “immigrants ” who are “[…] not used to, they haven ’t…it 
takes a bit of time for them […] and we accept that” (p. 136), since the 
general laundry practices in Sweden include several “do’s and don’ts” 
about when and how laundering should be done (Lund, 2009 ). 
Laundry facilities and rooms were analysed by Waitt and Now-
roozipour (2020) as a “political space of engagement ” (p. 16) and people 
engaged in activities related to laundry will have an embodiment of 
laundering. Embodiments of laundering entail, for example, experience, 
knowledge, norms and values, and are enacted as people relate to con-
figurations of a laundry room and doing the laundry. Waitt and Now-
roozipour (2020) draw on Deleuze and Guattari (1988) , Braidotti (2002) 
and Neimanis (2017) regarding rhizomatic, more-than-human and 
posthuman encounters with bodies, materialities and emotions. Building 
on Waitt and Nowroozipour (2020) , and their reference to Deleuze and 
Guattari (1988) , a topological view on power and space suggests that 
“events elsewhere are enfolded or woven into the political fabric of daily 
life” (Allen, 2016 , p. 35). What is included in the political fabric and how 
the inclusion and exclusion is done should be key concerns for research 
based in topologies of power and has been a source of inspiration for the 
present paper. 
5.Methodological approach 
The research for this paper was guided by approaches suggested by 
Haraway (1991, 1997) – situated knowledge, and Puig de la Bellacasa 
(2012) – thinking with care, where phenomena are viewed together with 
their relations to humans, non-humans, their worlds, and the associated 
“doings ”. Both approaches call for academic work that explores phe-
nomena as thick, layered and relational, and acknowledges tensions and 
frictions. In practice, these approaches mean spending time in the field, 
exploring and talking to the people involved and asking about their 
relationships and the challenges they experience. Humans involved in 
laundering practices in this case are tenants and area managers 
(employed by the property owner) who perform activities related to 
laundering in homes or communal facilities. Other actors, who influence 
the system from a distance, are for example local politicians, owners, 
designers, technicians and manufacturers. A public housing company, 
owned by the local government in a Swedish mid-sized town, owns the 
buildings, apartments and the 500 laundry rooms with their equipment 
and machines for washing and drying laundry. The empirical work 
consisted of visits to and observations of five different laundry rooms, 
interviews with 32 tenants in their homes, four area managers in their 
offices and a laundry host – a part-time employee, working daytime and 
assisting tenants in the laundry room. The visits to tenants ’ homes 
included a guided tour of the apartment, while the tenant talked about 
everyday activities at home. The interviews were semi-structured, 
recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed in relation to 
questions about how laundering was performed, where and when 
practices related to laundry happened, and why. The analyses were 
guided by our interest in details of tenants ’ reasoning about laundry and 
laundry activities, about clean and dirty laundry, and about who and 
what was involved in laundering at home or in communal laundry 
rooms. In some shared laundry rooms, the public housing company had 
installed new, energy saving washing and drying equipment as part of a 
company programme to reduce energy use in the buildings. Directives to 
reduce energy stem from the company ’s board of local politicians, who 
decided this company should aim for a goal to reduce energy use by 25 
percent by 2025, starting in the year 2011. The study started with an W. Glad

175interest in how energy saving measures were received by tenants and 
about their views on being part of these overarching environmental 
objectives. As data was collected and analysed, different tensions 
emerged from the material and these tensions backgrounded the focus 
on energy saving measures. To do the data justice, a critical analysis of 
care and power relations was chosen as the main contribution in this 
research. 
6.The choreography of laundering as processes of 
materialisation and spatialisation 
Understanding laundering as a matter of care (Mol et al., 2010) calls 
for an acknowledgement of the labour, maintenance and repair of 
laundry to “fix” dirty laundry. The fixes come in various spatial and 
temporal shapes and include many movements of fabrics as they are 
carried on bodies, placed in beds and around the homes - as bed linen, 
tea and bath towels, and eventually enacted as dirty. Fabrics could then 
be brought to the washing and drying machines; equipment that could 
be placed in the apartment, in the basement laundry room or neigh -
bourhood laundry building. Shaping of phenomena in socio-material 
approaches is perceived as a mutual process, where not only do peo-
ple influence the design, configuration and possible uses of machines 
and technologies, but devices shape and categorise phenomena, for 
example how washing machines produce categories of dirt (Shove, 
2003). The shaping also includes spatialisation activities, where spaces 
in and around homes are designed, dedicated or refurbished to fit for 
example a washing machine, and form part of the process of categorising 
dirt. How often is this space made available for individual households to 
do their washing; how many washing machines are available during the 
washing slot; and how are the spaces for drying clothes and linen 
designed and equipped? Are the apartments designed and equipped for 
alternative management of clothes that are not categorised as dirty? Is 
there, for example, equipment to air or dry fabrics on balconies or pa-
tios? A topological approach suggests the relations constitute the spatial, 
which might be fluid or fire space, enabling entities and their relations to 
constitute spaces for laundering. 
In this case, the design of individual apartments varied in the space 
made available for a washing machine or tumble dryer, thus creating 
certain practices around laundering available to tenants. Charlotte lived 
in a three-bedroom flat with her partner and her youngest son. Her two 
other children lived with their father. 
I: How often do you do the laundry? 
C: Once a week. Well, we do it in the laundry room. 
I: Do you have a washing machine in the apartment too? 
C: No 
I: Would you like a washing machine in your apartment? 
C: No, it is way too small 
(Interviewer and Charlotte, tenant) 
If circumstances were different, and Charlotte and her partner could 
rent a flat with a bigger bathroom, a washing machine would be 
convenient, according to Charlotte. But the washing equipment wasn’t 
her main concern. The combination of the start and finish time of the 
laundry room slot did not fit with the capacity of the drying equipment. 
Charlotte used the drying cabinet and claimed time wasn’t enough and 
sometimes they had to carry damp laundry up to the apartment. The 
remaining drying would have to be done in the apartment. The laundry 
work was mainly carried out by Charlotte, especially during ice hockey 
season, when her partner was playing away. Her son had never set foot 
in the communal laundry room. 
Bodies, movement and care in relation to the communal laundry 
areas have to be carefully choreographed in order to facilitate smooth 
and frictionless use and transitions between tenants (cf. Law, 2010). 
People have to start and finish within their time slot to prevent annoy -
ance and disturbances, as described by Waitt and Nowroozipour (2020). The choreography includes tenants moving up and down the stairs of the 
building, or using the elevator, carrying their dirty laundry, washing 
powder and fabric conditioner downstairs, and bringing their clean and 
dry laundry upstairs to their flat. The choreography enables a socio- 
material and spatial dance (cf. Law and Singleton, 2005; Law, 2010), 
mutually shaped by tenants, property owner, booking systems, washing 
machines, dryers and laundry. The dance is fluid, constantly changing in 
the details, but also maintaining many of the norms, values and practices 
around laundering. 
Berner (1998) described a rise in classifications of housing space and 
different activities, categorising certain spaces and activities as “back -
stage” and a domain for women and children. Behind the scenes, 
housework like laundering could take place, and the power over the 
ordering of things was mainly in the hands of women. Berner (1998) 
writes: “This power rested on competence. Keeping things clean and 
keeping them in order was work. It required knowledge and self-control” 
(p. 339). Floor plans for multifamily houses designed by architects put 
laundry rooms in the basement of buildings or in separate buildings. The 
placement of laundry facilities indicates that the performers of laun-
dering activities are expected to have both time and abilities to move 
through time–space, up and down stairs, in and out of doors and 
buildings, carrying bags and baskets of laundry, bottles with chemicals 
like detergents and fabric conditioners, and keys or tags for access to the 
locked rooms. One key to the apartment, one key to the basement door, 
another key to the laundry room and yet another key to the little lock to 
secure your laundry spot. Laundering in the basement of communal 
buildings has in some cases not been perceived as safe by the residents 
and in some recent renovations of housing in Sweden, the laundry rooms 
in the basements have been moved to ground level (Glad, 2005). In the 
present case study, the housing company experienced a decline in de-
mand for communal laundry facilities in some neighbourhoods. This 
was true in one of the less affluent residential areas, where the housing 
company initiated a discussion about spatial and temporal aspects of the 
laundering facilities they would provide. Should the laundry buildings 
be decommissioned or transformed into another laundering concept: 
monthly laundering facilities? In either case, a change in concept would 
have to include providing and installing one washing machine and one 
tumble dryer in each and every one of the 977 apartments. The two 
machines would be installed as a “tower”, commonly known as a 
“laundry tower”, with the tumble dryer sitting on top of the washing 
machine. The bathrooms are usually dedicated spaces for laundry 
towers, but before installation the spaces have to be refitted to manage 
an increase in humidity due to laundering. A laundry tower might also 
be an option for individual households that for various reasons doesn’t 
want or cannot use the common laundry rooms: 
Well yes, I have a washing machine in my apartment since I have had 
surgery on my back so many times. And I have not managed to, what 
is it called, walk to the laundry building, carry and lift. And that is 
why I have, kind of had, had to. So I rent it through [name of the 
housing company] […] it is SEK 100 [EUR 9] per month. (Aina, 
tenant). 
Care for tenants’ cleanliness and management of their laundry has 
guided the actions of the property owner, as they let laundry facilities 
evolve to fit individual needs and changing washing habits among 
groups of tenants. Regardless of the reason behind changing needs, in-
dividual households are offered the option to include a washing machine 
and sometimes also a household tumble dryer in the rent. Spaces for 
laundering are in this case characterised by fluidity, with constant 
changes and different options being considered, options that might be 
more or less realistic to implement. A tenant’s wish for private laundry 
equipment might be hindered by what sizes of washing machines are 
offered, household budgets for an increased rent, and space at home to 
accommodate drying of laundry. W. Glad

1767.Caring for clean laundry through automatic and manual 
controls 
Laundering can be found in many versions, and everyone has their 
own version of laundering and enacts different entities to carry out 
laundry practices in time and space. Care for the environment (cf. 
Eidenskog, 2015 ) was enacted by the property owner by investing in 
new washing and drying equipment that would lower energy and water 
consumption, and limit the detergent and fabric conditioner options for 
tenants. The dynamic processes of bringing absent entities to the fore 
and making them present includes, in this case, climate change and 
environmental issues, which motivated the board of the property owner 
to set an energy saving objective for the rental housing business. 
Included in these processes was also the “othering ” of certain tenants 
and what was perceived as their non-environmentally friendly practices 
(cf. Jack, 2018; Waitt and Nowroozipour, 2020 ). These practices 
included, for example, the use of chlorine bleaches which some groups 
of tenants included in their laundry activities. Another was the running 
of washing machines and drying equipment on empty, to “clean ” them 
after the previous tenants and pre-heat tumble dryers and drying cabi-
nets to make the drying quicker and more efficient. The laundry host 
Ingrid had noted some unwanted practices: 
Too much washing powder put in [the washing machines]. Throw in 
massive amounts of fabric conditioner. I don’t like that. […] For-
eigners use chlorine a lot, yes. They use a lot of chlorine. (Ingrid, 
laundry host). 
Henning and Lovgren (2002) observed tensions between laundering 
practices that different neighbours experienced, with some tenants 
specifically pointing at “foreigners ” or “immigrants ” as groups of people 
who had difficulties adopting the generally established practices in 
communal laundering. Foreigners were “absent made present ”, and in 
some sense used as an excuse to implement digitalisation and automa -
tion of laundering. New technologies were enacted to make unwanted 
practices absent. Over time and gradually control over when and how 
laundering could be done was transferred from tenants to the machines 
and automatic locks on doors to laundry rooms. Laundry rooms could in 
these cases be understood as fire spaces, where events in other specific 
locations influence how space was configured, without being directly 
connected in time –space. 
A tension between an increase in automation and the desire to 
manually work with and control the laundering space, machines and 
booking system was noticeable in the interviews with tenants. An 
intention from the property owner was to take control over the un-
wanted situations and behaviour, for example “stealing ” laundering 
slots of other neighbours and the use of bleaching liquids like chlorine in 
the washing machines. Automation was viewed by the property owner 
as part of the solution to such problems in certain neighbourhoods, 
noticeably less affluent city districts. One automated feature of washing 
machines was laundry powder, which was purchased in bulk by the 
property owner and automatically dispensed in the “right ” quantity 
depending on washing cycles and load. Tenants loaded the machines 
with laundry, the machine weighed the fabrics and distributed a certain 
amount of washing powder. Some tenants had doubts about this new 
order: 
I bring my own washing powder if the laundry is very dirty. My guess 
is that the laundry powder actually – which is environmentally 
friendly and very good, but – it [the laundry] doesn ’t get really clean. 
If it [the laundry] is really dirty. [laughter] (Caroline, tenant) 
A topological understanding of power suggests power could reach 
into everyday life through, for example, designs and configurations of 
technologies (Allen, 2016 ). In this case tenants are gently forced into 
coping with automated dosage of washing powder, but could still make 
their own configurations and add some detergents of their own. A “quieter register of power ” (Allen, 2016, p 2) is at work here, suggesting 
certain practices but still leaving other options open. Even if the landlord 
provided washing machines without compartments for detergents and 
fabric conditioner, tenants could still add washing powder directly to the 
laundry. 
Laundry rooms are in several ways fluid spaces, where there is a 
constant tinkering of configuring laundering practices (Mol, 2008 ). 
Some configurations were, however, scripted to be more fixed and 
impossible to adjust by tenants. With the facilities in the present case, 
washing cycles were relatively short, which made tenant Caroline 
question how efficient the machines were. Is a washing cycle of 38 min 
really long enough to get the laundry clean? “[…] Laundering goes 
quickly – 38 min is quick, I reckon. ” (Caroline, tenant). There seems to 
be a tension between tenants ’ appreciation of short laundry cycles, and 
finishing the laundry quickly, and an expectation of certain extensions in 
time for laundry cycles to really make the laundry clean. The semi- 
industrial design of the laundry room washing machines includes pre-
set options, easily available on the front of the machines – just press a 
button – 40 or 60 degrees – and the washing machine will start imme -
diately, weighing the laundry, displaying the weight – for example 4.5 
kg – and the tenant can fill the dedicated, built-in compartments with 
laundry powder and conditioner. This is perceived as an easy, “plug and 
play ” option, instead of looking for the right washing programme and 
temperature by turning a knob on the washing machine back and forth. 
The laundry routines in the different households were also described 
as either more “automatic ”, with similar procedures every or every other 
week, or more manual habits, where laundering was adjusted according 
to various demands, depending on activities such as sports. 
It depends [how often I wash clothes]. Typically, I would – like – 
wear t-shirts under, and such, I typically would use a day, but this [a 
shirt] I could use a week, as the jeans. Socks and underpants, those 
are also… And almost all training clothes also only once […] I sweat 
quite a lot, so typically what is closest to the body, I wash often and 
kind of the next layer must last a little longer, kind of. (Hans, tenant) 
This single tenant used the laundry room often and finds the facility 
suitable for his laundry habits, with irregular and frequent washing of 
sportswear and the layer of clothes closest to the body. Often the ma-
chines were fully loaded and most laundry was washed at 60 degrees, 
except for shirts that require ironing after washing and drying, which 
were washed on a 40 degree cycle. Another tenant, Anton, was a student 
who lived with his girlfriend and they did their together laundry once a 
month, or every 3–4 weeks. 
We pile up the laundry in a basket trolley in the bathroom. We wash 
once a month, or so, I don’t know, together, us two. It’s not more 
often than that, actually. Or I don’t think so. Or perhaps every three 
or four weeks. It usually works fine. There are often available slots, so 
you can go down [to the laundry room] a day or so ahead and book. 
And they have two big machines down there. And a big tumble dryer 
and drying room. So it is done in two or three hours. (Anton, tenant) 
Shove (2003) suggested that “[t]he size and content of the laundry 
basket is [..] closely related to the textile and fashion industries and mass 
production of clothing. ” (Shove, 2003, p. 118). The designs and scripts 
of many of the objects and machines involved in laundering have been 
developed for efficient care of a variety of fabrics and types of dirty 
laundry. The complexity continues to grow around laundering, as new 
fabrics and materials enter circulation and require special handling in 
the washing machines. 
8.Care for the environment and social dimensions of laundering 
Mol et al. (2010) tried to make us more aware of how care and 
technology are interlaced and could also include, for example, control 
and economics. For municipal housing companies governed by a board W. Glad

177of politicians, sustainability objectives might be guiding decisions to 
invest in new equipment. In this case, investments in new equipment 
were made as part of the aim to reduce energy use. New washing ma-
chines used hot tap water from the district heating system and new 
tumble dryers used heat pump technology to lower use of electricity. 
Care for the environment and business economics guided this company 
to invest in new technology (cf. Eidenskog, 2015 ), but tenants ques-
tioned the functionality and benefits for the environment: 
Don’t like the new [tumble dryers]. The laundry doesn ’t get really 
dry. It is supposed to be something to do with thinking about the 
environment, which is not always that good. It doesn ’t get dry. […] 
Well they, well it takes a really long time to dry. Especially, I don’t 
know if they [the tumble dryers] are smaller, yes they have to be 
smaller. So you can’t load as much in them. (Anne-Louise, tenant) 
The main purpose of the tumble dryer, to get the laundry dry, is 
missing in the new human-material-machine interaction. The perfor -
mance failed, both in respect to purpose and capacity. The time –space 
designed to host laundering practices of tenants did not cater for longer 
drying cycles and the amount of damp laundry. In this new situation, 
tenants enacted a reliable and available alternative: the old tumble 
dryers, still in place and effect in the laundry room. Anne-Louise (tenant) 
continues: 
Now I’m terrified, these two old, as long as they keep going, I’m very 
happy. But otherwise, I don’t know what I’ll do. (Anne-Louise, 
tenant) 
Another alternative was enacted in this new situation – use of the 
drying cabinet, which was not the preferred option, but would do in 
order to finish washing and drying within the limited allocated laun-
dering time –space per household. Drying in the cabinet had obvious 
disadvantages, since it wouldn ’t get the laundry as soft as in the tumble 
dryer and it slowed the laundering process down and distorted the 
preferred drying routines. An advantage would be that drying in a 
cabinet wore out textiles to a lesser extent than a tumble dryer cycle. 
Another version, existing simultaneously with Anne-Louise ’s version 
and making the new tumble dryer multiple, is the laundry host Ingrid 
who made attempts to learn about the new machines and communicate 
with the tenants about the advantages of the new technology and how to 
operate the new tumble dryer. Ingrid learnt from the manufacturer ’s 
representative that the combination of tenants ’ choice of washing cycle 
and heat pump powered tumble dryers is probably what is causing 
tenants ’ frustration. Short washing cycles have a short spin drier 
sequence, which is not enough time to get the laundry dry enough for the 
new tumble dryer. The laundry is too wet when loaded into the tumble 
dryers. Care for this particular laundry room was manifested by the 
presence of a laundry host Ingrid. Anne-Louise and other tenants in this 
building preferred to do their laundry when Ingrid was working, as she 
was able to provide guidance on how to use the different machines. 
Another tenant, Astrid, had lived in the same building and used the 
same laundry room for 49 years. For her one of the major changes 
recently is the introduction of “tags” to access the facilities. Tags in this 
case are radio frequency identification devices that are given to all 
tenants, have a unique identification and are used instead of keys to 
open locks on doors to communal and shared spaces such as staircases, 
recycling rooms and laundry rooms. Astrid appreciated the use of tags, 
but found the digitalisation of the booking system somewhat difficult to 
learn. In the earlier years as tenants, bookings of the laundry rooms were 
made by signing up on a shared calendar, and Astrid had experience of 
having her name erased or crossed over, and someone else using her 
time slot instead. The digital system is better in that respect. But to book 
a laundry slot, Astrid calls laundry host Ingrid, who helps her with the 
booking. Astrid always does her laundering during Ingrid ’s working 
hours: We [laundry host Ingrid and I] are like friends, she and I, you know. 
Drink coffee and like… I have a wonderful time down there [in the 
laundry room], yes I do. (Astrid, tenant) 
The social dimension of Swedish laundry rooms has been acknowl -
edged previously (Henning and Lovgren, 2002; Lund, 2009 ). The space 
for laundry can host spontaneous interactions and chats between tenants 
who would otherwise not meet. Laundering is something all tenants can 
relate to and many have something to say about the space, the machine 
or the organisation around the shared space. The digitalisation and use 
of tags hindered people from entering the laundry rooms, if they had not 
booked the slot. Another version of digitalisation was securing of the 
space, and your own laundry from other people. Relations could be built 
either around individuals, their laundry and household as part of the 
strong current for individualisation in Swedish society, or relations 
could be built with others, neighbours and their lives. 
9.Conclusions 
In this paper, it is suggested that relational materialism as proposed 
by Law and Mol (1995) , Mol (2002) and conceptualised as care, would 
benefit from an explicit focus on spatiality and temporality (Law, 2010; 
Allen, 2016 ). To conclude, we return to the aim of the paper: to explore 
laundry practices in Swedish rental housing and to make a theoretical 
contribution in the field of care, which could incorporate spatial and 
temporal aspects to be more inclusive. The current paper has elucidated 
spatial and temporal dimensions, understood as topological, in addition 
to the socio-material aspects of laundering, by focusing on dynamics in 
everyday life and as digitalisation and automation entered care of 
laundry. The empirical results show how interactions between humans 
and the social dimension in communal laundering are important but at 
risk when laundering is individualised and placed in private spaces of 
homes. A communal laundry room could facilitate care for each other 
and new friendships, although previous research also acknowledged 
potential tensions between tenants (cf. Henning and Lovgren, 2002; 
Lund, 2009 ). Choreography (cf. Buse et al., 2018 ) emerged as a key 
concept that captures timing, movement and use of space for laundering 
as tenants try to manage their dirty and clean laundry at the right time 
and place. 
Thinking with care as a methodological approach has brought 
backstage activities associated with laundering and hidden in basement 
laundry rooms or backyard laundry buildings to the fore. These spaces 
have proved to be important for tenants to manage their everyday life 
and quotidian activities of washing and drying home fabrics and clothes. 
When the theoretical concept care (Mol, 2002 , 2013) was included in 
the analysis, the material and technology unfolded as tightly coupled to 
the practices of laundering. Mundane technologies like washing ma-
chines were loaded with features that influenced whether they were 
suited for individual or communal use, and for use by a variation of 
different users. Care for efficiency overshadowed other values, espe-
cially time efficiency and use of communal space for laundering. 
Communal spaces for laundering were designed to provide space and 
time for efficient washing and drying, and facilitated standardised and 
normalised laundering activities, but failed to be flexible for individual 
requirements. The individualisation of laundering would imply 
releasing communal space but also mean densification of individual flats 
when machines are installed in bathrooms not designed to cater for such 
white goods. 
Shove (2003) developed “scripting ”, drawing on Akrich (1992) , to 
include not only how the design and programming of technologies in-
fluences our actions, but also how “scripts ” shape how we think and 
create meaning. In the present paper it is proposed to incorporate the 
design and organisation of indoor space in the notion of scripts. For 
tenants in Sweden, communal laundry rooms or buildings have histor -
ically been part of the provision of housing in a welfare system. New 
housing does not include communal spaces for doing the laundry, and in W. Glad

178planning for renovation of housing, property owners are considering 
closing the communal facilities and installing “laundry towers ” in 
refurbished bathrooms. For households which have washing and drying 
facilities in their home, the choreography of managing laundry is shaped 
by the social, material, temporal and spatial aspects of the home. For 
households in multifamily housing with communal laundry rooms or 
buildings, the choreography is more complex, involving the movement 
of bodies, clothes, linen, towels, detergents and conditioners in patterns 
which fit the design of communal laundering areas and temporal man-
agement with time slots. The added layer and complexity involved in the 
Swedish case shows how power relationships co-evolve around laun-
dering and how the notions of time –space and choreography could make 
the concept “scripting ” more inclusive and sensitive to matter that 
matters. 
Care for the environment (Eidenskog, 2015 ) was one of the top-down 
incentives to invest in new laundry technologies, such as the heat pump 
tumble driers in communal laundry facilities. However, this technology 
did not fit into the existing time –space of individual laundry slots and 
the choreography of tenants ’ movement between homes and laundry 
rooms carrying essential laundry items. A topological understanding of 
how power works from a distance shows how tenants ’ laundry practices 
are influenced by technologies chosen by others, making laundering a 
more complicated mundane activity for tenants. Environmental argu-
ments for installing new types of tumble driers or providing automatic 
doses of detergents were overshadowed by the inconvenience experi -
enced by the tenants. Care for the social aspects has historically in 
Sweden been part of communal laundry practices, with the laundry 
room being one of few spaces in apartment blocks where tenants do not 
just pass by, but also actually meet and talk to neighbours, or a laundry 
host, and weave a social fabric together. With laundering becoming a 
practice tied to individual flats, social encounters between different 
tenants can become rarer. As a positive effect, clashes can be avoided, 
but the social fabric might become thinner.
