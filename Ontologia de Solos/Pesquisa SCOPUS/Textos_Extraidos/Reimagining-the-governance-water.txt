Abstract
This paper speaks to the uneven scholarly attention gone into tracing dominant forms of water
governance as opposed to practices crafting alternative human-water relations on the ground.
Through the case of an Indian-based network mobilising to transform how we understand rainfedregions as rain-dependent socio-ecologies, I theorise their action ‘with care ’, a commitment to
think-with grassroots movements as actors capable of bringing new worlds into being.
Describing their activities as worlding-practices, I explore how the network confronts the invisi-bilities inscribed by the current paradigm reducing water to irrigation by de ﬁning alternative
metrological tools that recentre the governance of water from the perspective of the rainfall.
Tinkering with the variables of the constituted metrology, the network utilises an atlas, a formula,and an acronym to enact a different rainfed sociality into being, creating visibilities and cares for
neglected things. Through the story of a grassroots group and their strategies of mobilisation,
this account contributes to debates on how to pluralise water governance, suggesting that reima-gining its practices requires taking seriously the performativity of grassroots knowledges. Building
alliances between research and activism as e/affective world-building partners becomes key to co-
theorise liveable human-water relations and caring socio-ecologies at large.

Introduction
It was May 2021 and, unable to travel to India due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was discussing
remotely with Rohit1, an agronomist and grassroots advocate working in the Indian drylands, about
the country ’s vision for the future of rainfed regions –where agriculture depends primarily on mon-
soonal rainfall. ‘From the colonial times there has been a push to think of irrigation as the driver for
developing our landscapes ’.He begun re ﬂecting, ‘even nowadays approaches addressing climate
uncertainties are dominated by this idea that you must increase the supply. Then when you focus on
irrigation, you buy into myths that the health of your land can be created arti ﬁcially, and your work
measured as output of market products. This mentality just replicates the Green Revolution model
and is unable to value the richness of rainfed regions ’.He paused for a moment and added; ‘there is
a wilful ignorance at the heart of how policies understand water in rainfed areas. This ignorance iswhat we are actively trying to redress ’(Interview_Rohit_May2021).
Reimagining the governance of water requires rethinking our understanding of what water is and
the actors that can bear upon its diverse articulations. This article is motivated by a wish to addressthe uneven scholarly attention gone into tracing the establishment of dominant forms of water gov-
ernance as opposed to practices crafting alternative human-water relations on the ground.
Understanding realities as multiple and enacted (Mol, 2002), critical water scholarship(Ballestero, 2019a; Barnes, 2013; Savelli et al., 2022) has begun exploring water governance as
a practice that unfolds within speci ﬁc socio-material con ﬁgurations. Engaging with water as an
object with multiple materialities (Ballestero, 2019b) this work has untangled how diverse‘water worlds ’(Barnes and Alatout, 2012) emerge from assemblages of technologies, histories,
ideas, that policies themselves help bringing together and materialising. Governance practices,
they suggest, are productive of new ontologies, in they do not regulate water from a detached exter-nal place, but actively create spaces for their water worlds to exist (Lavau, 2013).
In the Indian drylands, for example, historical analyses have uncovered how colonial regimes
produced an irrigated reality by rearranging the existing rainfall-dependent agrarian landscapeinto one centred around predictable water ﬂows, with consequences still evident in the present
(Tozzi et al., 2022). Focussing on the politics at play when asserting one (water) reality over
another (Mol, 1999) this scholarship has pointed to the urgency of ‘pluralising both our understand-
ing of what water is and what its governance entails ’(Yates et al., 2017, 809) to make room for
more liveable human-water relations.
Yet, following feminist and decolonial sensitivities for which worldmaking processes are
located within relations of power as well as resistance (Gibson-Graham, 2011; Todd, 2016), it is
striking how while water management practices have been shown to partake in the ontological
project of inscribing hegemonic realities (Barnes, 2013; Linton, 2010), we are yet to think of grass-roots mobilisation as holding the mirroring capacity to recon ﬁgure and pluralise worlds. Thus,
while we know very well what current governance arrangements reduce rainfed areas to –vulner-
able regions to be secured through the steadfast development of an irrigated model of agriculture(Bharucha, 2019) –we are left with little material to imagine their future in different terms.
Taking this inconsistency as a starting point, I explore how we may rethink the governance of
water beyond the current irrigated paradigm by looking at the practices of the Revitalising RainfedAgriculture (RRA) Network –an Indian-based group of civil society organisations that mobilises to
transform our understandings of rainfed regions as diverse and dynamic territories, site for positive
transformations and hopeful futures. Contributing to social movement scholarship exploring grass-roots ’mobilisation beyond adversarial protest politics (Chesters, 2012; Choudry, 2015; Walsh,
2010), I theorise movements ’action ‘with care ’(Puig De La Bellacasa, 2011, 2017), re ﬂecting a
commitment to engage with them not as passive sites of knowledge for the academy, but activeworld-making agents.Tozzi 1171
I na t t e n d i n gt ot h eN e t w o r k ’s mobilisation as ontological work that advances the rainfall as
the ground for recon ﬁguring monsoon-dependent environments, I describe their action as
‘worlding-practices ’; concrete and situated activities that, by rearranging elements in particular
ways, contribute to the emergence of alternative (water) worlds (Moser, 2008). FollowingPapadopoulos (2018), understanding movements as composing the worlds they wish to
inhabit expands their mobilisation into the more -than-social arena, in they reweave the social
and material fabric of reality to make room for alternative ways of being (Ghel ﬁand
Papadopoulos, 2022).
To unpack how this ontological reformulation might be taking place, the work of Mitchell
(2008) is informative as he describes how worlds are supported by speci ﬁc metrologies –codiﬁed
systems of measurements that de ﬁne and therefore also circumscribe the ﬁeld of possibility. Being
subject to re-inscription but also open to contestation, metrological tools therefore provide concrete
sites from where actors can foreclose but also transform and reimagine the present (Ballestero andOyarzun, 2022). To challenge the invisibilities enacted by the current paradigm of irrigation, I show
how the Network sets-up a rival metrological system (Mitchell, 2008), crafting alternative tools that
recentre water governance from the perspective of the rainfall. An atlas, a formula, and an acronym–the Network strategically mobilises these techno-social devices (Ballestero, 2019a) to insert new
elements within their formulations and create visibilities into discarded things and relations. For if
realities are produced within speci ﬁc sociomaterial orderings (Latour, 1987) –including those held
together by hegemonic tools of enumeration and visualisation –it is by tinkering with the variables
of the constituted order that lie the Network ’s strategy to enact a different rainfed sociality into
being.
An argument running through the paper is therefore that many socio-ecological movements do
more than challenging established systems of governance by producing knowledges and ideas
regarding the objects of their struggles. More radically, they engage with the ontological as aspace for reinvention (Law and Urry, 2004), developing strategies that operationalise these pre ﬁ-
gured possibilities and rede ﬁne spaces of being. In taking seriously the performativity of grassroots ’
knowledges, the paper contributes to debates on how to pluralise water governance. In doing so, iturges research to move beyond their policy-centric focus (Shah et al., 2021; Taylor and Bhasme,
2020) which, analytically privileging sites of instituted power, unwittingly contributes to making
them dominant (Gibson-Graham, 1996). Instead, by re-focussing analysis from the ground up,the paper exhorts to be more curious about the theorising taking place in grassroots contexts
(Choudry and Kapoor, 2010) siding with a research practice that acts in the world by bringing
about the changes it wishes to see (Gibson-Graham, 2011).
The paper begins by expanding social movement research, proposing an understanding of grass-
roots action as performative of worlds. After outlining the methodology, I explore the ontological
work of the RRA Network as articulating alternative forms of living centred around the rainfall. Ithen situate their worlding-practices as establishing a rival metrology for water governance and
examine the three tools the Network devises and the visibilities each creates. In the conclusions,
Ir eﬂect on how taking seriously the worlding-practices of more-than-social movements advances
movements scholarships and critical water research.
Expanding research on (more-than)-social movements
Social movement research is often premised on the assumption that grassroots mobilisation is
enacted through oppositional organising aimed at political resistance as the end goal (Blumer,
1995; Shah, 2004). Taking movements themselves as objects of investigation, this perspectiveframes their action as challenging existing institutions and systems of power to establish what
factors render a group successful in achieving its goals. The analytical aim is to identify the1172 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
structures they oppose and mechanisms of mobilisation in order to generate new knowledge around
movements ’politics and strategies for success (McAdam et al., 1997).
Treating movement ’s knowledge as ‘corroborative rather than constitutive ’(Luchies, 2015, 528)
of theories, academic research has often reduced their action to a zero-sum game of protest politics,overlooking the rich analytical processes that takes place within activists ’circles (Choudry and
Kapoor, 2010). Calling for a different mode of scholarly engagement, Walsh (2010) thus suggests
that the reluctance to see movements as sites of knowledge creation has made it dif ﬁcult to capture
the transformative powers of their action. Beyond discerning strategies enacted in pursuit of polit-
ical transformation, Choudry (2015) adds, there is a need to appreciate how communities in struggle
articulate a diverse paradigm of being, voiced from experiences of social, economic and ecologicalmarginalisation (Kothari, 2014; Singh et al., 2018).
In this context, feminist theories of care indicate more generative avenues of engagement. Puig
De La Bellacasa (2011, 2017) de ﬁnes‘matters of care ’as those affectively charged practices that
make possible interdependent living in more-than-human worlds. Transforming the things we
study into matters of care, for Puig De La Bellacasa (2011), entails a deeper way of engaging
with them and take seriously their powers to generate care for historically neglected issues.Thinking with movements as matters of care therefore has a dual signi ﬁcance. First, it represents
a commitment to pay attention to movement ’s own intellectual processes, grappling with the com-
plexities of their knoweldges and practices in their own terms (Rodríguez-Giralt et al., 2018).Second, care refocuses the work movements do as ontological –as pertaining to that often-
neglected labour of focussing onto things at the margins to amplify neglected worlds (Henry,
2018; Tozzi, 2021b). The analytic of care therefore not only recognises movements as spaceswhere new knowledges are generated from marginalised positions (Choudry, 2015), but takes ser-
iously the performativity of their knowledges in composing the worlds movements struggle to
make possible.
When it comes to socio-ecological movements, care allows us to engage with their action as
crafting alternative ways of living in the world (DiChiro, 2019), opening to an enlarged understand-
ing of the social arena as made of a variety of beings (Tsing, 2013). According to Papadopoulos(2018), many contemporary movements are therefore better described as ‘more-than-social ’in
they materially rearrange more-than-human relations to make room for other ways of existing
and relating (Ghel ﬁand Papadopoulos, 2022) From permaculture practices designing eco-social
arrangements for ethical living (Puig De La Bellacasa, 2010), to community initiatives mobilising
to rede ﬁne water as a common good (Domènech et al., 2013), more-than-social movements engage
with the world as a ﬁeld for experimentation and confront the established political order with
their coming into existence. Before slogans denouncing dominant ideologies are chanted in the
streets or demands for recognition fully articulated, transformations begin quietly, from those
everyday practices that care to establish differences in ways of arranging our world (Schlosbergand Coles, 2016).
To remark this ontological dimension as a crucial (yet overlooked) component of contemporary
mobilisation, I describe their actions as ‘worlding-practices ’. Embodied, concrete, and situated,
worlding-practices represent those reality-generating activities that, assembling actors and elements
in speci ﬁc ways, contribute towards building some worlds and relations rather than others (Moser,
2008). Working within the contours of the present situation, these con ﬁgurations are sticky, needing
to be worked out from the particularities of each situation. The term therefore avoids the immateri-
ality of a politics of pre ﬁguration (Yates, 2015) associated with activists ’construction of a future
elsewhere and otherwise (see Blaser and de la Cadena, 2018; Escobar, 2018). Instead, I situategrassroots demands closer to the grounds of their struggles, within the everyday work people do
to bring about the realities they strive to make possible
2(Casas-Cortés et al., 2008; Chesters,
2012). Without assuming the emancipatory effects of their actions, these movements craftTozzi 1173
alternative forms of living from within; expanding, stretching, and probing the limits of the consti-
tuted order using resources at hand.
Understanding movements ’action as grounded within day-to-day practices also suggests that
inquiries could begin by looking at the nitty-gritty of the tools of organisation people deploy toengender change from their situated position. A good place to start, following Ballestero
(2019a), is to follow the devices, language, and ideas actors mobilise to rework the frameworks
we use to apprehend life. As concrete instruments onto which people anchor their political work(Ballestero and Oyarzun, 2022) mundane devices provide an unusual entry point into how
people within movements generate new care in the world by making visible previously unseen
objects and relations (Lindén and Singleton, 2021).
Bringing the proposed lens to bear upon scholarship on civil society organising around water in
India (Choudhary, 2000; Joy and Janakarajan, 2018; Paranjape and Kulkarni, 2018; SOPPECOM,
2010) enriches current research in important ways. Here ethnographically informed studies haveexplored in depth farmer ’s struggles against large dams (Baviskar, 1999), the challenges
mounted against water re-allocation to industries (Joy et al., 2014) and pollution of water bodies
by the hands of corporations (Bijoy, 2018). These contributions have highlighted the centralityof grassroots struggles in mounting critiques against the prevailing model of development on the
ground of ecology and social justice concerns (Joy et al., 2020; Omvedt, 1987), unfolding move-
ments ’intersectional dynamics across caste and gender relations (Baviskar, 2005; Omvedt, 1980).
Yet a mindset privileging movement ’s‘resistance and opposition ’(Walsh, 2010, 209) has so far
prevented us from engaging with how their critiques are not only contestatory, but also productive
of theories about how to bring about the alternatives they call forth.
Putting the worlding-practices of socio-ecological movements front and centre is therefore crit-
ical to rethink the governance of water against the grain of the current irrigated paradigm. The
urgency could not be overstated. Rainfed regions have in fact been historically neglected by policiesthat extended Green Revolution technologies developed for irrigated conditions into unirrigated
lands with disastrous social and ecological consequences (Harriss-White, 2008). Together with
loss of soil fertility and groundwater overextraction (Patel, 2013), the commercialisation of agricul-ture has turned farming into an incredibly risky venture. Compelled to borrow money at the start of
each season to purchase seeds and other inputs (Vasavi, 2020), smallholder farmers on unirrigated
lands are often just one failed monsoon away from defaulting on their loans (Sethi, 2021). Matthan(2023) has poignantly renamed this condition as a ‘climate of uncertainty ’, where weather variabil-
ity intertwines with ﬂuctuations in commodity prices on neither of which farmers have much
control. The tragic rise of farmers suicides (Vasavi, 2012) and the hardship women face whentaking care of agriculture in an institutionally patriarchal society (Kulkarni and Bhat, 2010), are
the latest examples of the broken promises of a capitalist mode of agriculture for all but the
lucky few.
In this context, calls for the accelerated adoption of technologies of irrigation as benign solutions
to build resilience against climate change are misleading (Bharucha, 2016). Doubling down on
age-old generalisation of rainfed regions as drought-prone territories characterised by endemic scar-cities (Mehta, 2005), these policies adopt a techno-managerial understanding of resilience as a nor-
mative goal of water supply augmentation (Tozzi, 2021a), while overlooking the power dynamics
and environmentally unsustainable practices resilient con ﬁgurations support (Taylor and Bhasme,
2020). These dynamics are exempli ﬁed by Bharucha et al. (2014) who show how even decentra-
lised approaches like watershed development are often driven by a supply-oriented mindset that
locks farmers into a regime of water-intensive cultivation ill-suited to the local conditions. Thisfeeds into a narrative where farming of ‘dry’crops (millets or pulses) –more adapted to withstand
rainfall variability –is seen in negative terms as farmers aspire to move away from rainfed produc-
tion systems altogether (Argade and Narayanan, 2019). Engaging with socio-ecological movements1174 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
articulating alternative hydro-social con ﬁgurations is thus crucial for the emergence of more equit-
able relations of agrarian production and reproduction in rainfed regions and beyond.
Methodological notes
The paper uses ethnographic methods (semi-structured interviews and participant observations) to
advance its arguments. The bulk of empirical material comes from a series of repeated interviews I
conducted with seventeen members of the RRA Network at national level and in the state ofMaharashtra. With 80% of its area under rainfed agriculture –the majority under drought-prone
conditions (Kuchimanchi et al., 2019) –Maharashtra is central to the group ’s mobilisation and
the testing ground for many of their campaigns. Interviews were conducted remotely and inperson over a period of eleven months between 2021 and 2022. To avoid ascribing participant ’s
worldviews onto a pre-established framework, interview themes were left open, allowing partici-
pants to introduce their stories while guiding the conversation around broad topics (Briggs,1986). The number of interviews conducted with each participant varied (between two and ﬁve)
depending on topics discussed and whether follow-up questions emerged during the research.
Interviews were conducted in English and each lasted around 60 min.
Whenever appropriate I attended online group meetings and followed discussions on WhatsApp
groups. These remote participatory observation methods (Postill and Pink, 2012) provided insights
on the everyday working of the group, feeding thoughts into following discussions and involvingparticipants in the production and re ﬁnement of research ideas. I also reviewed policy briefs, cam-
paign material and other documents produced by the Network alongside water and agriculture pol-
icies in Maharashtra.
In 2022 as COVID-19 restriction were lifted, I travelled to Vidarbha, Maharashtra, and con-
ducted interviews and participant observations with farmers in two villages where Network
members operate. These were identi ﬁed through Dharamitra, an organisation working on rural live-
lihood programmes in the region. Interviews took place in the farm, following ‘walk along ’tech-
niques (Kusenbach, 2003). With the help of a Marathi-English translator, I asked farmers to show
me around their land and share their knowledge about the rainfall, soils, cropping patterns, seeds,farming techniques, etc. This approach re ﬂected a commitment to invert research expertise and rec-
ognise that farmers ’knowledges cannot be separated from their enactment in the ﬁeld (Richards,
1993). I engaged with 23 farmers across gender, caste, ethnicity, and age groups. Conversationswere recorded and later transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis (Guest et al., 2011).
Following feminist research approaches (Haraway, 1988), my aim in the pages that follow is not
to narrate the story of the RRA Network as detached observer. Instead, grappling with the performa-tive power of my own thinking and writing (Law, 2004) I focus on aspects of the group ’s mobil-
isation that hint towards the world-making capabilities of their actions. This lens is inevitably
shaped by my own positionality (Sultana, 2007). As an early career scholar from Italy workingat a British University while conducting research in India, it is important to consider imbalances
with regards to my social and economic position and to re ﬂect on the epistemic inequalities repro-
duced during research encounters. Yet, as Nagar and Ali (2003, 356) note, these issues cannot beaddressed with re ﬂexivity alone, but require willingness to ‘cross multiple and dif ﬁcult borders ’,
shaking hierarchies in knowledge production to generate research that is contributes towards move-
ment ’s own goals (Bevington and Dixon, 2005). Re ﬂexivity therefore also emerged through con-
tinuous dialogues with participants, as I exchanged ideas and discussed ﬁndings during repeated
interviews to ensure that the research was faithful to their experiences and material produced mean-
ingful to them. This culminated with two workshops with RRA Network members and farmingcommunities where we re ﬂected on how to disseminate ﬁndings using policy briefs and other non-
academic outputs.Tozzi 1175
Daring to reimagine
If movements worlding-practices begin from the ground of situates experiences, the Network ’s
more-than-social mobilisation is seeded within a landscape of drought-proneness. A ﬁeld for the
display of socio-political in ﬂuence, rather than a ‘naturally-occurring ’phenomenon (Sainath,
1996) from the colonial times droughts –intended as periods of below average precipitation
leading to agricultural losses –have been the guiding principle to channel public policies into
rainfed areas (Tozzi et al., 2022). Supported by what Brooks (2017, 32) calls number narratives
–‘numerical stories about how water works in a particular place ’–drought-proneness reduces
complex socio-ecological relationships to one issue; water ’s unavailability making rainfed agrarian
environments governable through the techno-managerial script of irrigation (Bharucha, 2016,
2019).
‘All government programs revolve around irrigation. Expanding the area irrigated as the metric
for policy performances ’, Rohit explained. ‘What they [policymakers] see when looking at rainfed
areas is the need to drought-proof these regions by harvesting water. So they build check dams,recharge structures, percolation tanks ‘vaghera vaghera ’[etc. etc.]. But this does not re ﬂect
what water in rainfed regions really is. Forget about irrigation, here you need to start thinking
from the rainfall ’(Interview_Rohit_Dec2021). This point was advanced by other members
(Interview_Aparna_June2021; Interview_Dinesh_June2021) who expressed their frustrations
towards policies adopting blueprint supply-led solutions to enhance agricultural productivity
whilst ignoring the diversity of rain-dependent livelihood systems.
In the face of policies reducing water to a matter of irrigation, the RRA Network proposes ‘think-
ing from rainfall ’as the site for enacting alternative water circulations tied to the comings and
goings of precipitation. Emerged in 2009 from the disillusionments with the supply-oriented men-tality driving agriculture development programs, the RRA Network brings together a tapestry of
voices from practitioners, community advocates, social workers, researchers, farmer ’s groups
and grassroots organisations, to achieve a paradigm shift away from techno-managerial solutionspromising to secure rainfed drylands against rainfall uncertainties.
Rainfed geographies, the RRA Network posits, do not simply relate to monsoonal precipitations
as an external element against which lives and livelihoods need to be adapted. Rather, they composecomplex socio-ecologies constituted within and through its ebbs and ﬂows. A spatio-temporal phe-
nomenon binding together multispecies landscapes (Bremner, 2021), the rainfall is the protagonist
of the Network ’s more-than-social mobilisation, constituting the ground around which alternative
relathinships are to be built. ‘The whole “rainfedness ”will strike you ’.Rohit added trying to
convene an almost inexpressible characteristic of these landscapes, ‘how interdependent everything
is from the rainfall, its timing and distribution. Only when our policies will appreciate these dynam-ics, we may be able to build strategies where their diversity is valued ’(Interview_Rohit_Dec2021).
Turning towards the rainfall as their constitutive subject, the group engages in a series of experi-
ments that, starting from the practices of people inhabiting these lands, cultivate alternatives waysof living in rainfed ecologies. Farmer ’s study groups are key spaces for more-than-social experi-
mentation. Held in the evenings when work in the ﬁeld is over and household chores completed,
these gatherings bring together smallholder farmers interested in transitioning away from chemicalagriculture, alongside pastoralists, ﬁsherfolks, artisans and labourers whose livelihoods are punctu-
ated by rainfall
’s timing and distribution (Figure 1).
Following methods that are knowledge-based, rather than technology-led (Shankar, 2011), these
meetings encourage collective remembering where older generations name cropping arrangements
and plant ’s varieties grown in the past, promoting their revival in experimental plots, their conser-
vation and exchange during ‘millet jatras ’(millet journeys). Building connections across rainfed
livelihoods, the groups also promote women-led organisations manufacturing chemical-free1176 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
medicines for crops, integration between agriculture and livestock to regenerate soils, artisanal
ﬁshery carried out across ponds which turn into pastures as the monsoon retreats, alongside dissem-
ination of knowledge on soil health, indigenous plants and animal breeds.
Without aiming to restore a traditional ideal of a rural world, these fora indicate how socio-
ecological transformations do not necessarily begin from acts of direct opposition. Instead, they
materialise through the work of cultivating spaces where alternative con ﬁgurations of life can
emerge and gradually take hold (Ghel ﬁand Papadopoulos, 2022). ‘You will not see us demonstrat-
ing on the streets, blocking roads or go on hunger strikes ’Sameer explained: ‘what we say is to
start where the rain falls and from there build relations with the land, people, and environments ’
(Interview_Sameer_Dec2021). By no means synonym of disconnection, this plea for ‘autonomy
and self-determination ’(Interview_Sameer_Dec2021) re ﬂects the need to disengage from the
gravitational pulls of an irrigated direction of travel, cultivating broader networks of interdepend-
encies in its place (Tsing, 2020). For a revitalised rainfed agriculture to emerge, instituted systemsof governance should take seriously that inexpressible ‘rainfedness ’as an uncommon ground
around which alternative hydro-social con ﬁgurations are articulated.
To this end, the language of care was often deployed to inspire another kind of policymaking,
able to create visibilities and uncover relations overlooked by expert eyes. Behind that ‘wilful ignor-
ance ’Rohit remarked at the start of the paper, in fact sits a speci ﬁc modality of uncare operating
through the hands of policy actors. This ignorance was enacted through devices of categorisationand enumeration, as a distinct form of policymaking delimiting practices, relations and worlds seen
as possible and real from those unthinkable and hence unreal (Moser, 2008).
Aparna ’s recollection makes this clear. During a meeting with government of ﬁcials, she was
introducing the concept of ‘protective irrigation ’, a term used by the group to characterise
farmer ’s techniques to harness the rainfall across the soil pro ﬁle, making sure moisture is main-
tained at the root-zone of plants. Proposing this as an alternative form of irrigation she recallsbeing met with scepticism as she was unable provide a ﬁgure showing the water saving potential
of the strategy. ‘They did not care about what I had to say. They only see the water that can be

measured, the one that can be put into formulas ’she remembered with disappointment
(Interview_Aparna_July2021). Rather than an affective attitude displayed by people within govern-
ments, the uncare infused through these devices constitutes a modality of management that helps
creating invisibilities (Gupta, 2012), discarding metrics that hint towards worlds of water beyondthose gathered around its measurable form.
Yet, while speaking to the power of policy in silencing nonconforming (water) realities (Lavau,
2013), Aparna ’s story also hints towards places where the group ’s practices of reimagination can
fruitfully begin. For if, as Gupta (2012) suggests, ones ’understanding of the mechanisms of gov-
ernment matters in formulating strategies for action, it is by situating policy ’s performative powers
within its instruments of enumeration that indicates a location from where the Network ’s worlding-
practices could be articulated. This is where the paper turns next.
Care-fully theorising: utilising tools to multiply worlds
According to Mitchell (2008) the success of governance tools such as maps, formulas and modes of
classi ﬁcation, is determined not so much by their representational accuracy or mathematical rigour.
Instead, it depends on the extent by which they make it possible to conceive what is to be governedand assist with bringing it into being. In other words, when they support a metrology; a system of
signiﬁcation that de ﬁnes and upholds a speci ﬁc understanding of the world (Latour, 1987).
Confronted with the invisibilities cast by a metrology of measurable water ﬂows, the Network ’s
response was to craft a rival metrological system to rede ﬁne the governance of water from the per-
spective of the rainfall. Aparna explained
Demands for a different policy paradigm are teethless without a framework that converts our vision into
actions. Our strategy is to get into the language of ﬁcials speak and develop our advocacy around it. So
next time they ask us to prove the irrigation saving potential of our strategies, we have the instruments toask them back ‘what have you done to understand practices for protective irrigation in your district? Or
cropping system? Or livelihood integration? ’(Interview_Aparna_Jan2022)
A rainfed atlas, a rainfall ef ﬁciency formula, an acronym for soil classi ﬁcation, this is the initial
list of tools developed by the Network to return Aparna ’s questions back to policy actors, pausing
expert ’s imperatives and amend the invisibilities enacted by the prevailing irrigated metrology. As
an engineer-turned-social-scientists, I was initially disoriented by this strategy, having learned ﬁrst-
hand about the power technical instruments hold to support certain worlds at the expense of others
(Harris, 2004; Robbins, 2001). Yet, as Ballestero (2019a) points out, devices ’world-closing powers
should not be cofounded with their destiny. Showing how tools of enumeration are used by practi-
tioners in Costa Rica to distinguish water as a human right from water as a commodity, she unpacks
how actors use seemingly uninspiring techno-legal devices –like a list or an index –to drive social
change and urges water researchers to examine their working in other contexts. Similarly, research-
ing water scarcity in Bangalore, Vogt (2021, 99) narrates how a local organisation deployed a series
of quantifying tactics to ‘re-socialise and re-historicise ’water, suggesting that depending on how
enumerative tools are developed and by whom, they can contribute towards a more ‘multiple
and multiply-contextualised sense of water ’. Thus, while modes of abstraction and quanti ﬁcation
often end-up marginalising knowledges that do not conform with the dominant metrology(Henry, 2018) attempts to measure and visualise differently can go a long way into re-signifying
what water is (Ballestero, 2014), affecting in turn how water in its multiple historical and socio-
material forms can be cared for (see also Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015 on soils).
In a similar light, I read the proposed tryptic of tools as the Network ’s way to advance a careful
mode of theorising (Fernando, 2019), one that by revealing the invisibilities and exclusions1178 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
crystalised within everyday objects of governance, rede ﬁnes these objects to bring attention
towards previously unseen things and relation (Lindén and Singleton, 2021; Martin et al., 2015).
Such careful way of producing knowledge refuses universalist explanation, leading to the burgeon-
ing of categories, concepts, and ideas that, by creating new connections and relations, expand thepresent and open possibilities for different futures (Ballestero and Oyarzun, 2022). Situating their
world-making tactics within the crafting of alternative technologies of enumeration and visualisa-
tion, the group ’s mobilisation thus rests on what Puig De La Bellacasa (2017, 11) describes as
everyday ‘politics of reclaiming ’, an effort to work within the horizon of the existing condition
without accepting it as a given. In other words, the Network ’s theory of change expresses that
slow and incremental work of changing the present, tinkering with the variables of the constitutedmetrology to seed within them the conditions for a future where rainfed geographies are better char-
acterised, valued, and cared for.
In the remaining part of the paper, I explore how each of these tools zoom into one aspect of the
rainfed landscapes, situating the Network ’s worlding-practices within the reality multiplying cap-
acity care holds to make visible marginalised worlds.
The rainfed atlas
Atlases have been instrumental for inscribing the history of people and places. Bundles of maps
representing salient geographic features and political boundaries of a region, paired with socialand economic statistics, these cartographic books are performative of worlds (Del Casino and
Hanna, 2006). Providing a seemingly detached perspective from above, maps reduce complex real-
ities within pre-de ﬁned systems of categorisation and contribute to materialising the history of
people and places they are meant to simply represent (Harris, 2004). In recent years however carto-
graphies have also been used as tools for reinvention (Hazen and Harris, 2006; kollektiv orango-
tango, 2019), for breaking with past silences and give visibility to forgotten histories. Situatedwithin this counter-cartographic tradition, the Rainfed Atlas (also referred to as ‘The Atlas ’)
expands common understandings of Indian agriculture away from irrigated rice and wheat-
producing regions, characterising the diversity rainfed landscapes, their history, and livelihoodpractices. Challenging ideas of what counts as a map, The Atlas uses different modes of visualisa-
tion including graphs, charts, investment and divestment ﬂows, people ’s stories, livelihood cycles,
to bring readers into a different journey of rainfed socio-ecologies (The RRA Network, 2019a).
This journey begins in the past. Tracing the ‘nature and amount of public investments ’(The
RRA Network, 2019a, 3) from the time of independence, The Atlas begins by drawing the contours
of what, borrowing from Milligan and Wiles (2010), I describe as a landscape of (un)care; a web ofresource (re)allocation and (re)distribution that resulted in the systematic neglect rainfed regions
suffered from. Going at the heart of care as a relational practice, Milligan and Wiles (2010)
engage with its geographical manifestation, untangling the ways in which care relations (or thelack thereof) are woven into the fabric of a territory.
Similarly mobilising care as a guide into the hi story of rainfed geographies, The Atlas quan-
tiﬁesﬂows of public investments into irrigated regi ons, mirroring them with the continued dis-
regard for schemes considered the lifeline of r ainfed territories (e.g., rural employment
guarantees and integrated watershed program s). Staggering numbers run through The Atlas,
suggesting how while producing over 80% of crop varieties and supporting a number ofallied activities, less than 10% of yearly agricu ltural budget goes to strengthening this diversi-
ﬁed production. By contrast, public procurement o f rice and wheat together with fertiliser sub-
sidies mostly bene ﬁtting irrigated areas account for 75% of agriculture investments over the
years considered. Figure 2 provides a represen tation of this landscape of (un)care using a
collage of maps and graphs from The Atlas.Tozzi 1179
By exposing the historical neglect these regions suffered from while revealing how rainfed areas
are anything but a marginal part of the country ’s agrarian economy, The Atlas points to an uneven
history of social and economic relations and re ﬂects on its legacies, as they materialise in high inci-
dence of poverty, malnutrition and lacking public infrastructures (see also Kumar et al., 2020;
Deshpande, 2022). Reclaiming spaces for the ﬂourishing of these neglected socio-ecologies, The
Atlas tell us, is therefore more than just metaphor (Tuck and Yang, 2021) in it requires going
beyond the theoretical ground of recognising diverse systems of knowledges, to pay attention to
the lived material inequalities and urgent need for reparative practices.
Yet redrawing geographies of responsibility able to redress these uneven material and spatial
relationships (Raghuram et al., 2009) is not about reverting the ﬂow of public funding to redress
some asymmetry between irrigation haves and have-nots. What is at stake, I was told manytimes, is more complex than evening up skewed percentages. Instead, the responsible geographies
sketched-back by The Atlas are part of a broader effort to understand rainfed regions in their own
terms. As Anirudh explained to me, rainfed socio-ecologies cannot be understood with the sameparameters we use for irrigated regions. Instead, they require efforts to ‘revitalise our language
[…], and our vision ’(Interview_Anirudh_Sept2021) so that we engage with rainfed practices,
knowledge and relations without assuming a unidirectional trajectory of rural development.
Rich descriptions therefore populate the Atlas; starting from naming indigenous millets, pulses
and oilseeds cultivated in these regions, characterising their nutritional value, ecological and cul-
tural signi ﬁcance, giving relevance to cropping arrangements such as ‘Patta Paddhati ’or‘Akri
Salu ’, the choreography of crops they draw in the ﬁeld, situating farmer ’s knowledges of these
arrangements within practices of protective irrigation and soil regeneration. People ’s stories add
further texture, bringing to light feelings of self-esteem and joy that comes from reviving these prac-tices. One story is that of Vinodha, a farmer that to escape debt-driven cotton cultivation, shifted her
land to non-chemical cropping system. Storing most seeds every year and producing medicines
against plant ’s diseases, Vinodha now harvests 25 varieties of millet and pulses. These not only
provide enough food for her family and fodder, but also fetch a good price in the markets,
giving her some respite from the spiral of debts that come from practicing input-intensive

agriculture on unirrigated lands. The Atlas ’s work to represent-back rainfed regions and character-
ise their differences is exempli ﬁed in Figure 3.
Page after page, The Atlas multiplies the present situating the dominance of an irrigated and
monocropped landscape as only one part of a larger ecosystem of agrarian relations andmore-than-human ecologies. It is by characterising and giving relevance to this rich landscape of
practices as it already exists, rather than being imagined, that The Atlas highlights how policies
have a choice to support this diversity or continue along a trajectory of uncare, allowing differencesto deteriorate in the name of a more manageable uniformity.
The rainfall use ef ﬁciency formula
While The Atlas bears witness of the diversity of rainfed agricultural practices and ecologies, this
second tool engages with the temporal shift needed to appreciate the ‘rainfedness ’of these land-
scapes. The reduction of water to predictable ﬂows in fact not only ignores water ’s other shapes
and forms (Ballestero, 2019b), but also constitutes a choice in time. For one, the unspoken assump-
tion of water ’s liquidity overlooks all the other times when water is not ﬂowing along de ﬁned lines
but precipitating, evaporating or percolating in ways that resist delineation (Mathur and da Cunha,2020). In conceiving these messier moments as transient to water ’s liquid manifestation, policies
and management practice, according to Da Cunha (2019, 9), are grounded on one speci ﬁc
moment of the hydrological cycle; the moment of ﬂow.
No parameter better encapsulates this temporal orientation than Water Use Ef ﬁciency (WUE),
the key metric against which the success of water infrastructure projects is judged. Expressing
the relation between crop yields (kg) and the volume of water consumed to produce that yield(m
3) (Equation 1), WUE brings imperatives to raise ‘more crops per drop ’(Wanvoeke et al.,
2015), hurrying the water that precipitates on the ground into controllable ﬂows for synchronised
rhythms of crop production (Boelens and Vos, 2012). Overlooking the countless ways water getsentangled with different more-than-human elements (Camargo and Cortesi, 2019), WUE com-
mands an anthropocentric and future-oriented temporality where the past is reduced to something
to overcome and the present to a ﬂeeting moment towards the future (Adam, 2005). Rather than a
neutral quantitative assessment, WUE thus encapsulates a whole way of arranging agrarian life,
bringing uniform, highly synchronised, monocropped landscapes into being. This formula, Aarti

told, me will never be able to capture the complex social and ecological relations the rainfall sup-
ports (Interview_Aarti_March2022).
WUE =Crop Yield [kg]
Water used to produce that yield [m3]
Equation 1 shows the formula, expressing WUE.
Engaging with formulas as stories about the objects that sit across the lines of an equation
(Ballestero, 2014), the Network proposes Rainfall Use Ef ﬁciency (RUE) to advance a different tem-
poral narrative grounded on another moment of the water cycle; the moment of rainfall (Da Cunha,2019). Described as ‘a way of seeing, rather than a numerical exercise ’, and ‘an orientation more
than a prescription ’(Notes_Dec2021 ), RUE subverts ef ﬁciency idea(l)s, aiming to capture under
one expression all those relations that become meaningful when looking at a landscape from theperspective of the rainfall. Rohit explained:
when looking at water from the point of view of the rainfall, you start noticing all sorts of connections;
between soil and leaves covering the land to avoid evaporation, between growth of crops and the timing
of precipitation, between soil moisture and the ways roots develop. You would never have noticed these
if you looked at water in the conventional way. (Interview_Rohit_Jan2022)
The quality of this shift is better understood by taking a practice-oriented approach to time as
emergent within everyday practices (Adam, 2005). Rather than as a series of uniform intervalsticking in an abstract space, time is something we make through relations whose diverse con ﬁgura-
tions give rise to multiple temporal registers that exceed human timeframes (Bastian, 2019; Rose,
2012). The anthropocentric and future-oriented timescape expressed by WUE is therefore only oneamong many other temporalities shaping rainfed landscapes. To express this diversity, RUE cap-
tures a temporal horizon close to what Puig de la Bellacasa (2015, 692) describes as ‘care time ’;
an inclination to pay attention to and amplify temporalities rendered irrelevant by the productionistethos of ef ﬁciency.
My interaction with Veena, a farmer in Wardha District, renders this well. ‘This ﬁeld has red soil
which is not very good at holding moisture. So here I plant mung beans together with jowar[sorghum] and arrange them in rows. ’Explaining the reason for this arrangement she said,
‘jowar grows ﬁrst and being taller helps the mung growing on it. Then I harvest jowar, leaving
air and sunlight for mung to develop on its own. Their roots are also matched, see? ’she asked
showing me the two plants ‘when there is with mung, jowar searches for moisture deeper in the
ground which makes it stronger and more able to survive breaks in the rains ’
(Interview_Veena_2022). Invoking Tsing (2020, 229), the coordinations happening in Veena ’s
ﬁeld represent temporal responses where human intentionality gives way to a myriad of
more-than-human interconnections concatenated around the rhythms of the rainfall.
Elusive, uncertain, and tentative, temporal coordinations come out of attunements (Gan, 2018)
which, like care, improve with repetition, affectionate involvement and embodied knowledges
(Singh, 2013). Walking up and down the farm, Veena touched the soil next to the plants feeling
the moist it contained. Sometimes she added a home-made mixture of fermented animal urineand dung, jaggery, water, and leaves. This mixture increases earthworm activity, so that, as
worms move through the soil, they circulate nutrients and help plants grow healthier. While
tasks like this look unproductive, simply a waste of time compared to spraying fertilisers,Veena ’s care to make time to grow healthy crops re ﬂects a qualitatively different mode of engaging
with the landscape and its ecology. While never innocent nor romanticizable –representing1182 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
devalued and often unremunerated practices taking place within uneven socio-economic ﬁelds
(Pattnaik and Lahiri-Dutt, 2022) –her‘rainfall-ef ﬁcient ’labour contributes to the survival of
more liveable relations, demanding metrics able to capture its worth (Tozzi, 2021b).
Rather than a fraction with terms separated above and below a straight line, the relations RUE
describes are better expressed by what I describe as a ‘rain web ’. Figure 4 represents one such rain
web sketched from my interactions and participant observation with Veena. Starting from the
element of the rainfall, this web brings together an assemblage of entities –soils, plant ’s roots,
crops and their arrangement in the ﬁeld, farmers practices, etc. –brought into alignment around
the rhythms of the rainfall in one particular site. Capturing a speci ﬁc set of relations, each ‘rain
web’is unique, a snapshot that represents one group of interconnected temporalities that become
relevant to ensure liveability in a place.
Proposed by the Network as an alternative tool for policymaking, RUE is not about ﬁnding a
recipe to be abstracted and scaled. Rather, ‘it is an enunciation that needs to be left in the hands
and practices of people ’(Interview_Rohit&Sameer_Jan2022). Invited to present these ideas to a
group of experts advising the government on the upcoming National Water Policy (The RRA
Network, 2019b), the group believes that what is now a simple enunciation could nudge the gov-ernment towards seeing water out of their usual box. While unlikely to replace WUE in the hearts
and minds of engineers, their hope is that the situated analytic RUE advances will start circulating

among policy actors, bringing attention towards those rain-dependent practices and relations the
Network hopes to make visible.
The acronym of the 3Ms
Further thinking from the webs of relations coordinated around the rainfall, this last tool addressesanother problematic aspect of the irrigated metrology; namely the separation it maintains between
water and the lively biota soils are made of. Re ﬂecting with Puig De La Bellacasa ’s (2015, 170)
precept that ‘what soil is thought to be affects the ways it is cared for ’, the 3-M acronym challenges
common understandings of soil as a container for plant nutrients (Rinot et al., 2019), demanding
that we see soils as inseparable from the water they hold. In place of chemical models reducing
soils ’health to combinations of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K) (Marchesi,
2020) the proposed acronym foregrounds a different way of knowing, relating, and caring for
soils (Krzywoszynska et al., 2020; Tironi et al., 2020) as multispecies worlds permeated by
wetness; that is a world of Moisture, organic Matter, and Microbes (MMM).
The Network ’s proposition is a response to the nationwide Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme.
Launched in 2015 to address worrying levels of soil degradation caused by overuse of chemical
fertilisers, the scheme encourages farmers to send soil samples to testing facilities who provideinformation about nutrient status and recommend fertilisers to improve productivity. Figure 5
gives an example of a SHC for the region where this study was conducted. It shows in clear
terms how SHCs ascribe soil fertility to a set of chemico-physical parameters, reducing soilscomplex socio-material relations to a simpli ﬁed representation (Marchesi, 2020) and soil knowl-
edge to some distant expert advice (Kon et al., 2020). Re ﬂecting on the performativity of soil

data from the Department of Agriculture and Farmer ’s Welfare (2022).1184 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
health assessments in inscribing soil realities, Krzywoszynska and Marchesi (2020) suggest that
their metrics lead to a mode of engaging with soils that is both shallow and universalist .Shallow
because they reduce soil ’s multi-dimensional materiality to a thin surface, and universalist
because they obscure soil ’s speci ﬁcity to some standardised parameters.
Particularly worrisome for the Network is the way in which these nutrient-centred pro ﬁles over-
look soil ’s hydrological functions (Indoria et al., 2020), invisibilising the relation between soil ’s
capacity to retain water, its lively ecology, and farmer ’s attentiveness towards such moist-rich
underground world. A publication launching the 3M acronym as part of the ‘Living Soils ’cam-
paign makes this clear; ‘life and livelihoods in rainfed areas depend on the quantum of rains that
can be harvested and retained across the soil pro ﬁle’, a reality being ‘dangerously overlooked ’
by the prevailing focus on chemical indicators (The RRA Network, 2017). Discussing the need
to develop alternative metrics Tapan noted, ‘This understanding of soil as an NPK bucket could
not be more dangerous than in rainfed regions. Here we cannot afford to reduce our soils to a fer-tiliser treadmill like in irrigated areas. A healthy soil cannot exist without water, soil without moist
is meaningless ’. From the porch of his house, he picked some earth from the garden, ‘can you tell
the difference between the soil and water? ’he asked opening the palm of his hand
(Interview_Tapan_March2022_PersonalNotes).
Going at the heart of soils ’ontological politics (Mol, 1999) –a politics over which soil realities
get enacted, silenced, or never voiced (Krzywoszynska and Marchesi, 2020) –the 3-M acronym
challenges the invisibilities promoted by shallow and universalising SHC guidelines, demanding
that we take seriously soils ’wet materiality as the terrain from where rainfed grounds become
known, legible and ultimately worthy of care (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015).
Observations of farming practices are revealing of these dynamics. When asked what constituted
a healthy soil, farmer ’s response followed an intricate exploration of how it was the land ’s ability to
capture precipitation, together with soil ’s texture and its capacity to conduce water towards plant ’s
roots or create obstacles with stones and other layers that made a difference (see also Cortesi (2021)
for a similar exploration in Bihar, India). Conversely, a good monsoon could not be separated from
how the temporality of the rainfall matched soil ’s ability to get soaked by its precipitations. As
farmers explained to me what makes a good rainy season is an initial stage of downpours softening
the ground followed by frequent and short breaks allowing water to percolate deeper into the soil.
These interruptions also send a signal to plant ’s roots that begin searching for moist at different
depths, strengthening plant ’s ability to withstand future dry spells. As roots go deeper, they facili-
tate circulation of nutrients, feeding microbial population across layers (FieldNotes_2022). Figure 6
captures the difference between a healthy soil (left) and an unhealthy one (right) and how thisrelates to its moisture content.
Caring for rainfed soils therefore connects to farmer ’s ability to look after the water they
contain, devising cropping patterns where plant ’sg r o w t hi sc o o r d i n a t e dw i t hr a i n f a l l ’s
timing, roots systems matched to capture mois t at multiple depths, covering the ground with
leaves to avoid evaporation, re-ploughing residues to increase organic matter, and reducing
tillage to protect microbial population which in turns preserves water (Tozzi andLeonardelli, forthcoming).
The 3-M acronym enlarges policy metrological sensibility, demanding that we reimagine what
counts as soil beyond a chemically-de ﬁned surface and medium through which water passes, but as
a lively ecosystem composed of and made through the water it contains. Deepening understandings
of what soil is thought to be, the tryptic of Moisture, Microbes and Matter affects how it becomes
worthy of care, demanding new indicators able to grasp its vitality. Beyond shallow and universalistSHC classi ﬁcations, new modes of accounting demand ‘looking down and deep ’(Krzywoszynska
et al., 2020, 99) below the surface, and learn from existing practices engaging with soil-(rain)water
dynamics.Tozzi 1185
Conclusions
Motivated by a wish to go beyond scholarly approaches prioritising the enactment of hegemonic
forms of water governance, this paper turned towards a grassroots organisation to unfold the
ways in which the governance of water is contested and reimagined from the ground up.
Thinking alongside a rich feminist tradition for which research is about opening pathwaystowards the worlds we wish to inhabit (Gibson-Graham, 2011), I engaged with the RRA
Network as a more-than-social movement (Papadopoulos, 2018) whose mobilisation is not directly
aimed at contesting existing institutions. Instead, it pertains to ‘worlding-practices ’; situated,
embodied and care-full activities that zoom onto what is at the margins to amplify neglected
words (Lindén and Singleton, 2021). Rather than as an object of academic knowledge, I
engaged with their action as ‘matters of care ’(Puig De La Bellacasa, 2017), re ﬂecting a commit-
ment to learn from and think with movement ’s own analytical ground without subduing them to
pre-existing frameworks (Choudry, 2015).
Establishing the rainfall as the terrain around which monsoon-dependent ecologies ought to be
recon ﬁgured, I explored how the Network confronted the current metrology of water ‘as irrigation ’
by crafting a series of rival tools that would recentre its governance from the perspective of precipi-
tation. Attending closely to these tools as concrete nodes of ontological reinvention revealed howthe Network ’s mobilization was immanent to the very project of governance it set out to challenge.
Without resorting to a politics of pre ﬁguration for a rainfed world yet to come (Yates, 2015), their
strategy is to appropriate and subvert the idioms through which the legitimacy of the current modelof agricultural development had been sought. The group ’s tactics of reimagination therefore
reﬂected that painstaking work of establishing incremental (yet meaningful) differences working
from the constraints of the present (Ballestero, 2019a). Speaking to scholarship tracing the perfor-mativity of policies and management practices (Barnes, 2012, 2013; Lavau, 2013; Yates et al.,
2017), I have argued that reimagining the governance of water will not happen solely by revealing
the powerful networks of actors crafting spaces where their water worlds can survive. Instead, itrequires taking seriously grassroots forms of mobilisation as similarly productive ontological inter-
ventions with the power to bring new worlds into being.

The Author.1186 EPE: Nature and Space 7(3)
Bringing the Network ’s care-full work to bear upon climate adaptation research (Nightingale
et al., 2020; Taylor, 2014) also suggests an avenue for climate resilience strategies to get out of
the impasse they ﬁnd themselves in (Mikulewicz, 2019). This impasse is represented by the fact
that their techno-managerial solutions (of irrigation and otherwise) have been shown to redistribute,reinforce of even create new vulnerabilities rather than addressing their root causes (Eriksen et al.,
2021; Schipper, 2020). In this regard, the paper suggests that scholars interested to politicise climate
adaptive responses and make them work towards emancipatory outcomes should direct their atten-tion towards places beyond the remit of climate action (see also Koslov, 2019; Paprocki, 2022). In
fact, while not speaking of climate change as a direct issue of concern, the Network ’s mobilization
articulates a broad set of political, economic and ecological transformations that emerge through thealternative hydro-social relations their tools give rise to. As we become aware of the signi ﬁcance of
rainfed lives and livelihoods, of the more-than-human temporality precipitation entangles, and the
vitality of the wet ground underneath our feet, their tools become a vehicle to transform existingrelations of rainfed agrarian production and reproduction expanding what equitable and just adap-
tive strategies in these regions might look like.
Finally, attentiveness towards movements as productive of their own theory of the world and of
pathways for how to get there (Casas-Cortés et al., 2008), also speaks to a space where grassroots
worlding-practices can contribute towards a feminist and decolonial agenda (Gibson-Graham,
2011; Todd, 2016). In this regard, the paper calls for closer ethnographic attention to unexpectedand mundane places of grassroots theorising as sites from where concrete alternatives to hegemonic
realities are articulated. Without guarantees that more equitable, decolonial and nonpatriarchal
ways forward will emerge, encouraging productive alliances between research and activism as e/affective world-building partners is crucial for co-theorising more liveable human-water relations
and caring socio-ecologies at large.
