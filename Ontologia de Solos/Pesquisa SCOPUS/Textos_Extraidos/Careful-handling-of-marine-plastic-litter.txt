Careful handling of marine plastic litter :
Technology assessment and care
Sarah Maria Schönbauer*, 1
Abstract Waste is a core concern of today’s societies. A prominent ex-
ample is marine plastic litter, which has devastating impacts on ocean
ecosystems. But: How can technology assessment (TA) support a careful
handling of plastic waste in the sea? And what can care concepts con-tribute to the practice of TA in this context? In this article, I show that
care concepts can help understand the complexity of waste manage-
ment as well as the environments involved, regulation processes, andtechnical innovations. Moreover, care concepts could beneﬁt TA practiceby sensitizing it not only to cultural, regional, and global concerns, but
also to the distribution of responsibility and marginalization processes.

Introduction
Waste is a core concern in today’s societies. One example for
waste is waste in the ocean. The marine area has gained promi-
nence lately as part of the UN Ocean Decade which started in2021. Marine waste, also called marine litter or marine debris,
consists of variously sized objects, such as ropes, bottles, cans,
ﬁsh nets and plastic and microplastic particles, the latter rep-resenting a substantial fraction of marine waste. Marine litterﬂoatsanddriftsaround–seeminglyendlesslyasitissubmerged
and diluted within the vastness of the deep oceans – before it
ends upin thedeepsea orontheshorelines. Thus,marine litteris not conﬁned to one area but dispersed throughoutthe oceans
on earth, creating a global problem. At the same time, marine
litterisnotalwaysnecessarilyvisibletohumansasasubstantialamount resides in spaces largel y inaccessible to human inter-
vention, such as the deep sea. In this article, I highlightmarine
plastic litter, a material which has undoubtedly risen to somefameinthelastdecadeandargue,thatcarecanserveasatoolintechnologyassessment(TA)practicetoreﬂectonthecomplexity

ecotoxicological eﬀects due to leaching its components. Based
onthis,leadingmarinescientistshaveframedmarineplasticlit-ter as a coreglobalenvironmentalproblem(Napper et al.2021;Bergmann et al. 2015). Similarly, societal stakeholders, non-
governmental organizations, policy makers and citizen groups
identiﬁedmarine plastic litteras highlyproblematic.This prob-lematization has led to political incentives and to a plethora of
technological innovations focused on cleaning the ocean, rivers
and streams. ‘Horizon’, the European Union’s Research and In-novation Magazine featured some technological innovations in2022, among them cleaning robots for picking up waste on the
shorelines, cleaning technologies for big and small plastic ob-
jects or mobile application for the detection of litter (Willmer2022).Butalthoughtechnicalinnovationsforcombatingmarine
litterareassessed(Bellouetal.2021),itstillneedstobeﬁgured
out which solutions might work best and for whom and where,who are the societal stakeholdersthat care aboutmarine plastic

All these contexts make marine litter an important case for
TApracticeanditsfocusonpoliticaldecision-makingprocesses,enabling a broad societal discourseon technical innovation and
theireﬀects,amongthemforexamplethroughparticipatorypro-
cessesincludingdiﬀerentsocietalstakeholdergroups(Grunwald2002). This is even more so for TA practice that explicitly dis-
cusses human-made problems on a global scale (Böschen et al.
2021;Hennenetal.2023).Theglobaldimensionofmarineplas-tic litter also resembles otherwaste debates, amongthem in TA
practice and its concern with nuclear waste (Töpfer and Ufer
2019; Hansson 2022), concerns that involve various stakehold-ers dealing with environmental concerns. The global characterof marine litter, its diﬀerent forms and formats and its presence
in diﬀerent ecosystems such as the ocean surface or the deep
sea,as well as its diﬀerent sources,howevercreate a conceptualchallenge,thatIsuggestcanbetackledwiththeconceptofcare.
Ia s k :
How can technology assessment scholars care for
marine plastic litter and what can care concepts add to
technology assessment practices?
I highlight care as my conceptual take for the enrichment of
TApracticesbythinkingalongthecomplexityofmarineplastic
litter, eﬀorts for its regulation and socio-technical innovations
for its removal. Speciﬁcally, I argue that a focus on care canbe particularly fruitful for TA practice that focusses on global
environmentalproblems suchas marine plasticlitter. Care con-Leadingmarinescientistshaveframedmarineplasticlitter

and voices (Puig de la Bellacasa 2010, 2011, 2015) and allow
to thinkabout“everythingthat we do tomaintain, continueand
repair ‘our world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible”(Tronto 1993, p. 103). Attending to care is insofar relevant, asthe ocean is currently featured as carbon storage space crucial
for humankind and its survival. This scenario is however only
possiblewithanoceanthatisnotconstantlypollutedandindan-gerbutanoceanthatisresilient.Newtechnologicalinnovations,

Conceptualizations of care
Carerepresentsacoreconcerninmanysocialsciencedisciplines.
Prominent scholars, such as Mol (2008), Moser and Pols (Mol
etal.2010)andPuigdelaBellacasa(2010;2011),havebroughtthenotionof‘care’intothecenterofinterestindiﬀerentcommu-
nities,amongthemScienceandT echnologyStudies,ascientiﬁc
communityon whosework I largely draw on.Aprime example
of work on care and its conceptual impact is that of Puig de laBellacasa who demands an understandingof care that allows to
see“howthingswouldbediﬀerentiftheygeneratedcare”(2011,
p.96).Incallingforaspeculativecommitmentfor“situatedandpositionedvisionsofwhataliveableandcaringworldcouldbe”
(2011, p. 96), she calls for engagementbeyondnormativeinter-
ventionsandawarenessforoppressedandneglectedexperiencesthatcreate oppositionalpositions.Thereby, PuigdelaBellacasa
aims to unpack relationships alonga focus onmarginalized and
excluded voices, in order to “not only (to) expose or reveal in-visible labors of care, but also to generate care” (2011, p. 94).In this sense, care not only allows to analyze care practices but
also unpacks who engages in care practices, who is left out or
marginalized.Appliedtothecaseofmarinelitter,theconceptofcarecanopenupwhatoftenstayshidden,suchastheoccurrence
of marine litter in diﬀerent spaces, the deep sea or the ocean

24second, it means to provide for, look after, protect, sustain, and
be responsible for something; third, it indicates attention and
concern,tobecareful,watchful,meticulous,andcautious;while
its fourth meaning [...] is to be troubled, worried, sorrowed,uneasy, and unsettled.” Taking up Murphy’s characterization ofcare, Ihavepreviouslydevelopedthenotion environmentalcare
(Schönbauer2024),aconceptthatallowstounderstandcare for
environmental changes on individual and collective level basedon the premises of emotional attachment, responsibility, atten-
tion and concern as well as the worries and uneasiness that
environmental harm invokes for those studying them and thoseaﬀected by it. In thissense, care can providea speculative com-mitment for aﬀectedness, for relationships with an empirical
concern, for researcher responsibility and attentiveness towards
aglobalphenomenonandits complexramiﬁcations.
Marine plastic litter as a concern for TA
Since marine plastic litter is a global problem that cannot beconﬁnedinplacenortime,itsglobalcharacterresonateswithre-centcalls from TAscholars,namelythatTApracticeconcernedwith environmental problems needs a global agenda. Böschen
andcolleagues(2021)identifytheneedtoaccountfortheglobal
dimensionsand complexityofglobalhuman-madeproblemsasacorechallengeforTApractice. Hennenandcolleagues(2023)
also argue that the inherent global characters of many current
problems call for international connection to reﬂect on techno-
logical innovations. The need for international connection that
TA scholars argue for, is tangible for example in political reg-ulation processes for marine plastic litter. The identiﬁcation of
marine areas in need of protection already happened in 1974,
when theUnitedNations EnvironmentProgramme(UNEP) haslaunchedaRegionalSeasProgrammeinordertoprotectmarineandcoastalenvironments.Thisprogrammebroughttogethervar-
ious stakeholders and also addressed marine litter. Later on in
2022, UNEP adopted a resolution to develop a legally bind-ing mechanism to stop plastic pollution, the so-called ‘Plastics
Treaty’, a resolution which was considered a break-through for
thefutureoftheocean(UNEP 2022).

help tounderstandthediﬃculties ofregulatory processesin the
marine area. In the following, I will attend to some aspects of
marineplasticlitterthatshowcaseitscomplexityandhowitcanbeunderstoodwith care.
Marine plastic litter: a complexity
Marine plastic litter often resides in spaces that are not imme-diately accessible for humans. Objects dis- and re-appear from
theglobalecosystemandtravelintimeandspacewithaninher-
entthere-but-not-therequality.Aprominentexampleformarineplastic litter is the Great Paciﬁc Garbage patch, a huge accu-mulation of marine litter in the Paciﬁc. It is a space that is out
of reach for most humans while full of marine life and plastic
objects.DeWolﬀ(2014)hasforexampleshownhowmarinelifeusesplasticobjectsashabitatintheopensea.Fishandotheran-
imalsﬁndshelterintheseobjectsandsmallplasticobjectstravel
withthem.Atthesametime,plasticlitterhastoxicandharmfuleﬀects on this ocean sphere. Based on the entangled nature of
marine plastic litter and marine life, Bergmann (2019) has ar-
guedthat care isa crucial conceptto thinkwith. Care can meanto relieve the ocean ecosystem from an anthropogenic markerwhen removing plastic litter. Yet, care can also result in marine
life being denied an infrastructure that it got used to. Thinking
with care then means to focus on the relationships that marineplastic littercreates withmarine life.
Connected to care for marine life and litter entanglements,
carecanalsoopenupaﬀectedness.Thinkingalongmarineplas-
tic litter with care needs to take into account human and more-
than human entities, both being aﬀected diﬀerently by plasticobjects. If taking into account marine life and its entanglement
withmarineplasticlitteraswellasenvironmentsoutofhuman-
inhabitedworlds,carecanmeantofocusonaﬀectednessbeyondhuman-centered interpretations (Lindén and Lydahl 2021), animportant reframing for environmental problems. Thereby, TA
scholarscan attendtoemotionalattachment,protectionandres-
ponsibility,attentionandconcern,butalsotakeintoaccountwhois being troubled and worried by the presence of marine plastic
litter. This shift in focus could serve TA practitioners to attend
to the complexity of aﬀected marine life, to the relations beingmade. Marine plastic litter then results as a complexity ratherthanisolatedproblem.
Connected to these sensibilities is the existence of marine

(Thompsonetal.2004;Liboiron2019;Bergmann2021).While

and descend to considerable oceanic depths. Meanwhile, big

25plastic objects can potentially be removed from the ocean, al-
though only in extremely costly undertakings (Galgani et al.
2010). An example for this is the Ocean Cleanup, an organiza-
tion featuring a technologicaldeviceinventedby a team aroundDutchentrepreneurBoyanSlat(TheOceanCleanup2024).Thisapproach has been criticized by marine scientists based on the
entanglement of marine life with marine waste and the lack of
discrimination between individualplasticobjects andthosethatareinhabitedbymarinelife. Whilesuchtechnoﬁxescontainthe

those of repair and purity (Shotwell 2016; Liboiron 2016) and
demandsdiﬀerentformsoftechnologicalinnovationbeyondhu-man-centered imaginationsonan environmentalproblem.
These sensibilities connect to arguments in global TA that
urge TA practice to move beyond traditional Western concepts.
For one, Ely and colleagues (2011, p. 21) state, that TA has tobecomemore“transnational,networked,virtualandﬂexible”in
ordertostayattentivetoglobalenvironmentalproblemsandthat
Western concepts do not necessarily ﬁt into every cultural andregional context. On the other hand, Hahn and Ladikas (2021)similarly formulate a main challenge for globalTA: to dedicate
worktonationalaswellasglobalcontextsandregionalconcerns.

ﬂection on plastic objects in relation to powerful asymmetrical
relationships, those created by international commodity chainsand international and national waste infrastructures. Thinking
with care also allows to reﬂect on marine plastic litter and its
diﬀerentforms,formatsandinhabitedenvironmentsandtherebyhighlight the relations plastic objects build before entering theocean, when landing on the shorelines, or when residing in in-
accessibleoceanicdepths.
Marine plastic litter and regulation
Connectedtomarineplasticlitteranditscomplexities,TAprac-
titioners and care scholars argue, that marginalized voices andcommunities often stay invisible but might be aﬀected most,
such as by residues of waste. An example for an event whichThinkingwithcarethenmeanstofocusontherelationships
thatmarineplasticlitter createswithmarinelife.took into accountmarginalized voices is the ﬁfth session of the
UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2) which took place in
March 2022. UNEA-5.2 was historic insofar as it was the ﬁrst
step towards creating a binding agreement for the regulation ofplasticwaste–includingthemarinearea.Laterin2022,amulti-stakeholderforumwas being implemented,includingscientists,
ﬁnance sector representatives, civil society groups, indigenous
people and youth representatives. This also resonates with thewritten resolution published in March 2022 stating the impor-
tancetorecognize“workersininformalandcooperativesettings
tothecollecting,sortingandrecyclingofplasticsinmanycoun-tries”(UNEP 2022,p.3), suchas wastepickers,islandcommu-
nities and ﬁsheries. The involvement of marginalized voices is
symbolic for how waste resembles a global matter yet needs tobe reﬂected along regional and cultural contexts. For example,it is crucial to highlight the diﬀerent contexts of aﬀected com-
munities. Fishers working on the shorelines are economically
dependent on their profession and the well-being of ﬁsh habi-tat, while waste pickers are exposed to toxic chemicals when
caring for inland recycling infrastructures, often informal ones
(Schlitz 2020).Andisland communitiesare particularly vulner-able to marine plastic litter (Lachmann et al. 2017) as they arechallenged with its ecological eﬀects, are dependent on coastal
tourism or limited in their prevention strategies. Hence, emo-
tional attachments vary as well as measures for protection, res-ponsibility distributions and how the diﬀerent communitiesare
troubledandby what.
Along these diﬀerences, the negotiation processes of
UNEA-5.2 oﬀers insights into the challenge to include societal
stakeholders along their diﬀerent aims. For example, Melanie
Bergmann,aGermanmarinescientist,attendedthefourthmeet-inginOttawainspring2024.Shenarratedthediﬃcultyofinclud-ingthewholelifecycleofplastics,suchasderivativesandchem-
icals, into regulation practice and the importance yet marginal-
ization of voices from scientiﬁc communities (Bergmann n.d.).Hence, not only aﬀected communities but also those research-
ing the impact of marine plastic litter are challenged for their
expertise being heard. This is also based on the diﬀerent keymotivationstotackleplasticpollutiondependentonagendapri-oritizationsfromsocietalstakeholders,posingchallengesforthe
development of a binding instrument (Knoblauch and Meder-
ake 2024). Hence, there is no uniﬁed interpretation of care formarine plastic litter yet. Related to this struggle, TA scholars
arguethatdiﬀerentformsofexpertiseneedtobeaccounted,that
diﬀerentstakeholdersandsocialgroupsneedtobeincludedandthatreﬂexivityneedstobeeﬀectivelyintegratedinTAprocesses
(Ladikas and Stamm 2023). A focus on care can add to this

marginalized and which stakeholders remain absent from envi-
ronmentalregulation processes.

mental organizations and communities of local ﬁsheries withdiﬀering worries. It also means to take into account and relate
regional, national and international concerns and foster future
meetings and regulation practices that include various societalstakeholders, showcase their expertise, but also their (varying)
environmentalconcerns.
Conclusion
I have started by asking: How can TA scholars care for marine
plastic litter and what can care concepts add to TA practices?
I argue, that marine plastic litter demands a notion of care that
takes into account diﬀerent voices, spaces, times, governanceregimes, policies, regional, national and international contexts.Marineplasticlitteralsodemandsasensitivitytoitsappearance
in diﬀerent forms, formats and spaces, its large inaccessibility
and invisibility but also its omnipresence, characteristics thatmake regulation processes and just technological innovations
diﬃcult.
I have shown that thinking with care on this matter allows
to understand the complexities of an environmental problem,
suchasmore-thanhumanrelationships,there-deﬁnitionofpol-
lution in the omnipresence of plastic objects, and aﬀectednessin and marginalization of socialgroups. A focus on care is thusimportant to understand technologicalinnovations that promise
to tackle marine plastic litter, in order to see whom they help,
whose voices and concerns they leave out. This could for ex-ample mean to challenge current plastic production processes
anddemandpoliciesforjustandeﬀectivecleaningtechnologies
(Bergmann et al. 2023)or to think aboutalternative productin-novationandtorethinkcommoditychains.Thinkingwithcareisalso important regarding regulation practices and aﬀected com-
munities and to reﬂect on the potential selective attention that
regulation processes bring with. I argue, thatintegrating care asconceptual tool responds to the call for conceptual enrichment
in TA practice of how we can best attend to the socio-techni-
cal challenges of future times (Böschen and Dewald 2018). Anenvironmental care for marine plastic litter could open up “the
complexities of caring in turbulent times with regards to po-tential catastrophic events lingering in the future and cases of
destructionor variable harmthatreside inthepastand present”
(Schönbauer 2024, p. 18). Reﬂecting with care and focusing
onenvironmental care could assist TA practitioners by helping
to sensitize TA practice towards emotional attachment, respon-sibility, attention and concern and environmental uneasiness,
core characteristics of care that open up “neglected experiences
thatcreateoppositionalstandpoints”(PuigdelaBellacasa2011,p.96).
It seems imperativefor globalenvironmentalproblems to be
reﬂected alongcare conceptsandanalyzenegotiationprocesses,marginalizedandpresentactors,butalsothedistributedrespon-sibilities, aﬀectedness and worries that they bring with. This is
all the more important in view of the global nature of marine
plastic litter and the debates on environmentaljustice at global,international, nationalandregionallevel.
