BrazilABSTRACT
Science-policy interfaces like the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BPBES) aim to 
provide policy-relevant knowledge that guides decision-makers in addressing the current biodiversity crisis. At 
the same time, dominant approaches to policy-relevant knowledge have been widely challenged for relying on a 
misguided linear model that treats science and policy as separate domains, presenting the former through 
depoliticized ideals of neutrality and objectivity while prioritizing efficiency, standardization, and measurable 
outputs over transdisciplinary collaboration, inclusivity, and plurality of knowledge systems. This article focuses 
on “care” as an embodied, situated, and relational practice that could open pathways to policy-relevant 
knowledge that is inclusive and responsive to diverse human and non-human needs. Through semi-structured 
interviews and analysis of Summaries for Decision-Makers (SDMs) in BPBES, we investigate how different 
forms of care shape the content, creation process, and impact of SDMs. Our findings reveal that care is present 
across all of these dimensions but also that systemic barriers limit its practices. In particular, we argue that the 
legacy of the linear model often creates tensions with care perspectives as they can often be seen as too subjective 
and as threatening the credibility of BPBES. We, therefore, conclude that there remain substantial challenges to 
articulating a vision and practice of “caring policy-relevant knowledge ” that embraces care as central to shaping 
relations between science and policy.
1.Introduction
Brazil is the most biodiverse country on the planet (Abranches, 2020; 
Inoue and Mendes, 2024 ), “comprising at least 10–20 % of the world ’s 
species described to date ” (Brazil, 1999 ). The Brazilian Platform for 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BPBES) was created in 2015 to link 
science and policy for protecting this diversity (Azevedo-Santos et al., 
2017; Karam-Gemael et al., 2018 ). BPBES follows the model of the 
Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), aiming to create science-policy interfaces (Jagannathan et al., 
2023 ) that produce policy-relevant knowledge and thereby allow for 
more effective responses to biodiversity loss at national and global 
scales.
BPBES and IPBES respond to the urgency of biodiversity crises with a 
vision of evidence-based environmental policy that has become 
increasingly contested because of its reliance on a linear understanding 
of science-policy relations. Framing science and policy as separate do-
mains, the linear model presents scientific evidence as a neutral and

objective basis for political decision-making (Beck, 2011 ). While such a 
framing aims to increase the epistemic authority of science by dis-
associating it from overt political agendas, it has also been extensively 
criticized for misrepresenting the complex interplay between science 
and society (Mahony and Hulme, 2018; Gustafsson and Lidskog, 2023 ) 
and obscuring the role of science as an instrument of modernist control 
that reduces nature to an object to be exploited, conserved, or managed 
(Turnhout and Lynch, 2024 ). Framing environmental sciences as neutral 
and objective also fails to recognize how the field has been shaped by 
neoliberalism, often reinforcing a narrow focus on values of productivity 
and efficiency (Santiago et al., 2017; Hartman and Darab, 2012; Lorenz, 
2012; Temper et al., 2019; Stengers, 2016 ).
The linear model also creates tensions with growing attempts to 
embrace epistemic plurality in environmental policy (Pascual et al., 
2021 ), including Indigenous methodologies (Chilisa, 2017, 2019; 
Absolon, 2022 ), transdisciplinary approaches (Bammer, 2016; Lang 
et al., 2012; Ludwig and Boogaard, 2021 ), co-production (Matuk et al., 
2023; Teng o et al. 2017 ; Turnhout et al., 2020 ) and participatory action 
research (Enria, 2016 ; Moriggi et al., 2020 ; Kindon et al., 2007 ; Long 
et al., 2016 ). These approaches highlight that knowledge is always 
entangled with diverse standpoints and challenge decontextualized ap-
peals to neutrality and objectivity as obscuring the political dimensions 
of knowledge production (Longino, 1990; Harding, 1993 ). Therefore, 
emphasis on epistemic plurality puts questions about the inclusion and 
exclusion of diverse forms of expertise into the spotlight (Ludwig et al., 
2024, Turnhout et al., 2019 ) and challenges simplistic understandings 
that separate alleged non-political science and political decision making.
These contestations of the linear model point towards a fundamental 
challenge for science-policy interface (SPI) platforms such as BPBES and 
IPBES. On the one hand, both organizations increasingly aim to embrace 
epistemic plurality. For example, “IPBES recognizes and respects the 
contributions of Indigenous and local knowledge to the conservation 
and sustainable use of biodiversity ” (IPBES, n.d.), and BPBES highlights 
the central role of Indigenous peoples ’ knowledge of wild resources and 
their contribution to environmental preservation (Menezes, 2019 ). On 
the other hand, both BPBES and IPBES tend to follow institutional leg-
acies grounded in a linear model of science-policy relations and legiti -
mize their epistemic authority through the allegedly neutral and 
objective character of their research (Stålhammar, 2021; Díaz-Reviriego 
et al., 2019; Lahsen and Turnhout, 2021 ).
In this article, we address this challenge in BPBES by introducing 
“care” as a theoretical-methodological lens. We analyze how forms of 
care emerge in BPBES, and in the production and impact of Summaries 
for Decision Makers (SDMs). Informed by feminist (Puig De La Bellacasa, 
2015 ; Tronto, 2013 ; Krzywoszynska, 2019 , among others) and Indige -
nous and local perspectives on care (Taku ˘a, 2022 ; Losito, 2022 ; Ressiore 
et al., 2024a ; Ressiore et al., 2024b ; Weitzman et al., 2024 ), we un-
derstand that SDMs involve forms of care and are more than just neutral 
and objective summaries of facts. Such an interpretation suggests a 
vision and practice of “caring policy-relevant knowledge ” that embrace 
subjectivity and plurality as constructive elements at the interface of 
science and policy rather than as distorting factors that need to be 
eliminated in the quest for neutrality and objectivity. Yet, our findings 
show that prevailing norms of the linear model obscure the forms of care 
in BPBES. While care - for example, about preserving biodiversity and 
the policy impact of SDMs - is salient across our results, the expression of 
care is often seen as problematic and sidelined in attempts to emphasize 
the epistemic authority of SDMs as factual summaries free of subjective 
bias. As such, we find that care turns out to be both present and pre-
carious in BPBES. Caring policy-relevant knowledge can, therefore, not 
be taken for granted but requires the explicit challenging of the legacy of 
the linear model in science-policy interfaces.
2.Theoretical framework
Care is often both ubiquitous and invisible in the creation of policy- relevant knowledge. As Fisher and Tronto (1990, p.40) argue, care is 
“everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our ‘world ’ so 
that we can live in it as well as possible. ” Indigenous and local episte -
mologies frequently focus on care as integral to knowledge production, 
centering relational understandings that connect humans and 
non-humans through caring knowledge practices (Taku ˘a, 2022 ; Ressiore 
et al., 2024b ; Weitzman et al., 2024 ; Losito, 2022 ). Furthermore, femi-
nist thinkers highlight that care is a matter of public concern and expose 
“how [the] social and political institutions permit some to bear the 
burdens (and joys) of care and allow others to escape them ” (Tronto, 
2013 , p.32 –33). Care can be unfair and unequally distributed along 
class, gender, and race, making care a political matter (Hankivsky, 2014, 
Bartos, 2018; Silberzahn, 2024; Raghuram, 2016 ; Barnes, 2012 ).
Both Indigenous and feminist care debates have emphasized rela-
tionality, reciprocity, and interdependence across species, communities, 
and ecosystems (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ; Ca~nada et al., 2022 ; Sil-
berzahn, 2024 ; Krzywoszynska, 2019 ; Ressiore et al., 2024a and 2024b ). 
Care has been centered on “transformative thinking, politics, and 
alternative forms of organizing ” (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017 , p.8) and it 
can challenge the neoliberal norms of “fast science ” that often bypass 
careful and reciprocal practices (Staffa et al., 2022; Sellberg et al., 2021; 
Stengers, 2016; Temper et al., 2019 ). In contrast to dominant neoliberal 
rationalities that favor autonomy, individuality, and reason, care the-
ories prioritize well-being and relational practice that embraces emo-
tions like empathy, responsiveness, and sensitivity (Held, 2006; Manzi 
et al., 2024 ).
The ongoing burgeoning literature on care constitutes a promising 
entry point for rethinking policy-relevant knowledge beyond the legacy 
of the linear model. Care is neither neutral nor objective but still drives 
scientists and shapes their engagements with environmental policy. 
Highlighting the forms of care at the interface of science and policy may 
help to foreground the subjectivities involved in these forms without 
undermining the epistemological importance of environmental science 
for environmental policy. Understanding care as shaping the interface of 
science and policy requires analysis of its many dimensions, including 
attentiveness, reciprocity, maintenance, and repair. Attentiveness in-
volves observing and responding to the needs of others — both human 
and non-human — while maintaining a reflexive awareness of power 
relations (Krzywoszynska, 2019; Bartos, 2018 ). Attentiveness, therefore, 
requires more than attention to the data and metrics that inform 
biodiversity policy; it also involves the interpersonal relations and the 
lived realities and values of those impacted by policies.
Reciprocity emphasizes relational interdependence, acknowledging 
that care involves giving something back, often spanning asymmetrical 
power relations (Ojeda et al., 2022 ; Van de Pavert and Ressiore, 2023 ; 
Ressiore et al., 2024a ). It connects to ideals of empathy and putting 
oneself in the shoes of others (Ressiore & De La Rosa, in press ). Main -
tenance and repair are about sustaining and recovering ecosystems, 
practices, and relations, among others, to allow both humans and 
non-humans to live well in the world. Within BPBES, these could become 
evident in the (inter)personal relations that need to be maintained or 
repaired. Other forms of repair concern the practices of restoring eco-
systems and bridging knowledge systems, as well as the attempts to 
address the gaps between science, policy, and society. BPBES itself and 
the people sustaining the platform could be seen as both aiming towards 
the maintenance of life on Earth as well as trying to repair our damaged 
planet through knowledge production and action in the science-policy 
interface.
While attentiveness, reciprocity, maintenance and repair are essen -
tial, they do not exist separate from politics. Care is political and is also 
permeated by unequal power relations and ethical dilemmas. Care re-
quires constant negotiation and adaptation. Puig de la Bellacasa (2015, 
p.707) points out that care, although necessary, is also “messy and dirty, 
” often involving ethical dilemmas and moral conflicts. These dilemmas 
arise especially in relation to what knowledge is considered relevant, 
who decides, what methods are used to decide, and under what A. Ressiore C. et al.

conditions the policy-relevant knowledge is created. The decisions about 
which perspectives, approaches, and rationality shape what is included 
or excluded (Giraud, 2019 ) have real consequences on the impact of the 
assessments. Analyzing BPBES through a care lens, therefore, highlights 
the complexity of relations between Summaries for Decision-Makers and 
processes that shape their creation. While summaries are often pre-
sented as neutral and objective summaries of facts, their creation is 
shaped by messy relations of care that are permeated by tensions, ef-
forts, and political ambitions.
3.BPBES: an overview
During the IPBES Americas Regional Assessment in Bogot ˘a (July 19 
to July 23, 2015), a group of Brazilian experts decided to produce a 
national assessment using IPBES ’s pre-established concepts and struc-
ture (Padgurschi and Joly, 2017 ). BPBES emerged from this initiative 
and included around 100 scientists from various Brazilian universities 
and research centers - currently, the number of scientists involved 
fluctuates according to the needs for specific assessments. BPBES oper-
ates as a bottom-up initiative led by scientists and independent of direct 
government control (Scarano et al., 2019 ). Although 85 % of its funding 
comes from government sources, BPBES maintains autonomy, relying on 
partnerships with organizations such as the Brazilian National Council 
for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the BIO-
TA/FAPESP Program (Fapesp, n.d.), and the Brazilian Academy of Sci-
ences (ABC).
Initially conceived as a working group under the Brazilian Society for 
the Progress of Science (SBPC), BPBES evolved into a permanent plat-
form emphasizing a decentralized and collaborative model (Padgurschi 
and Joly, 2017 ). The organization includes an executive coordination 
team, a techno-scientific council, and a diverse pool of volunteer re-
searchers, apart from those receiving grants or employed for text revi-
sion and communication (BPBES, n.d.). In 2018, BPBES launched its first 
Brazilian Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which 
highlighted the state of national ecosystems. Since then, it has produced special reports on pollination, restoration, water resources, and other 
critical topics - see Table 1.
BPBES ’s independence from government and other institutions is 
central to its credibility and claims of objectivity and neutrality, but it is 
also a source of several challenges (Scarano et al., 2019 ). For example, 
fundraising and stakeholder engagement necessitate continuous efforts 
that can be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and may exceed the 
skill set of the participants, who work voluntarily and accumulate many 
other academic functions and responsibilities. While BPBES envisions 
producing a "living document" that fosters ongoing dialogue and 
adaptability (Scarano et al., 2019 ), this goal is difficult to sustain given 
the limited resources and the fact that the authors are overburdened 
with academic responsibilities. While BPBES executive coordination 
anticipated issues such as fatigue and disengagement among partici -
pants in 2019 (ibdi), from our research it seems that it remains a constant 
challenge. These challenges illustrate both the BPBES ’s objectives to 
connect science, policy, and civil society, offering valuable insights into 
science-policy interfaces in Brazil (BPBES, n.d.; Scarano et al., 2019 ), 
and the need for further reflection on how care practices might address 
these challenges and sustain its potentially transformative role for 
biodiversity conservation policies in the country (Scarano et al., 2019 ).
4.Methodology
To investigate the forms of care in BPBES ’s Summaries for Decision- 
Makers (SDMs), we employed qualitative methodologies comprising 
semi-structured interviews and document analyses. Ten online semi- 
structured interviews (Roulston and Choi, 2018; Hesse-Biber, 2013 ) 
were conducted by the first author between May and September 2024. 
She conducted interviews with four members of the Executive Coordi -
nation, two members of the Technical Coordination, one researcher who 
specialized in text revision and communication, and three authors who 
contributed to specific thematic SDMs. Nine out of ten interviewees were 
involved in BPBES ’s SDMs as co-authors, reviewers, or in other sup-
porting roles. The one exception provided support to the main coordi -
nation team during the platform ’s early development, assisting in 
scoping its goals, coordinating with the main authors of the first 
assessment, and drawing from their experience with IPBES SDMs. The 
participants were invited for the interview via e-mail, and the online 
interviews lasted from 45 min to 2 h. Interviews were recorded and 
transcribed using Microsoft Teams ® transcription software.
During the semi-structured interviews, participants were invited to 
share their personal understandings of care, their perspectives on the 
work of the SDM creation processes, their visions regarding the chal-
lenges and opportunities in working with BPBES and policy-relevant 
knowledge, among others. Key questions included: What are the grati-
fying and challenging aspects of working with BPBES? What does care mean 
to you in the context of BPBES? What practices do you associate with care in 
creating the SDMs? How do you perceive the role of policy-relevant knowl -
edge, and how does it differ from scientific knowledge? (see full interview 
guide in Annex 1). The interview approach aimed to be flexible, 
allowing participants to discuss these topics, including understandings 
of care, on their own terms. Therefore, the interviewer provided mini-
mal theoretical framing until the end of the interview questions.
In addition to the interviews, a qualitative content analysis (Leavy, 
2017; Roller and Lavrakas, 2015 ) of seven SDMs published by BPBES - 
see Table 1- was conducted. This analysis aimed to identify explicit and 
implicit expressions of care in the content, structure, and language of the 
documents. For that, we used direct quotations - translated into English - 
from the SDMs and interviewees. Interviewees were randomly 
numbered, and after each quote, we placed between parenthesis I and a 
randomized number (for example, I3 refers to interviewee 3).
The document analysis involved multiple rounds of reading: an 
initial review to familiarize ourselves with the documents (also to pre-
pare for the interviews), followed by a detailed analysis process to 
extract themes and patterns related to care aspects such as maintenance, Table 1

attentiveness, reciprocity, repair, empathy, responsibility, among 
others. Special attention was given to the tensions between (a) expres -
sions and terms such as “neutrality” and “objectivity”; and (b) relational 
aspects associated with and needed for a caring approach.
In addition, MSc thesis research was carried out by our second author 
in 2021 and 2022. This study draws on qualitative research including 
ten interviews and document analysis of twelve reports (including SDMs 
1–6), to examine BPBES as a boundary organization and its engagement 
with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) (De Fusco, 
2022 ). For this article, the secondary data from the MSc research was 
used, especially in the BPBES contextualization, analysis, and discus -
sion. These data provided context to understand BPBES’s efforts to 
integrate diverse knowledge systems and foster inclusivity in its 
practices.
Inspired by feminist research methodologies, the authors engaged in 
continuous dialogue to reflect on how their positionalities influenced 
the questions, data interpretation, and writing process (Harding, 1993; 
Hesse-Biber, 2013 ). The first and the second authors are early-career 
women researchers: the first specializes in more-than-human care and 
feminist research approaches, while the second brings knowledge about 
boundary organizations and biodiversity governance. The third and 
fourth authors are senior men researchers with extensive experience in 
investigating knowledge diversity and addressing the ontological and 
epistemological challenges of putting different forms of knowledge into 
dialogue. Finally, the last author is a senior woman researcher with 
extensive experience and involvement in IPBES and science-policy 
interface debates and critiques. Two out of the five researchers are 
Brazilian, while the others are European. We considered how our 
standpoints influenced the questions we asked in the interviews, the 
document analysis, and the processing of the data (Hesse-Biber, 2013 ).
5.Care in BPBES
When investigating what forms of care emerge in BPBES’ production 
of policy-relevant knowledge, we focused on (5.1) the content in Sum-
maries for Decision-Makers, (5.2) the processes of developing these 
summaries, and (5.3) their impact on policy.
5.1. Care in the content of SDMs
This section presents our key findings about care in the content of the 
SDMs. We argue that (1) care is present in SDMs through notions of 
maintenance, repair, and the plurality of perspectives they accommo -
date, that (2) explicit care terminology is largely absent , and that (3) the 
emphasis on efficiency and efficacy creates tensions with a more sub-
stantive care discourse in the SDMs.
In the SDMs, care most explicitly emerges through the emphasis on 
ecological restoration associated with notions of maintenance and 
repair: 
“The maintenance and restoration of natural areas” (SDM 2, 2018, 
p.14)
“Investing in biodiversity conservation and restoration” (SDM 1, 
2018, p.12)
“Maintaining the ecosystem service of pollination requires hetero -
geneous landscapes that are managed in a pollinator-friendly way, 
providing vital resources for these animals, such as a diversity of food 
sources and nest-building sites.” (SDM 2, 2018, p.11)
While the first two sentences express the maintenance and repair 
aspects of care, the third quote reflects the multifaceted nature of care, 
involving both human and non-human needs. Multifaceted needs are 
also highlighted regarding human communities, emphasizing the plu-
rality of stakeholders in the process of biodiversity conservation. “Good governance also requires objectivity, commitment, trans -
parency, and comprehensiveness, ensuring inclusion and plurality of 
ethnicities, genders and generations. The ability to adapt and adjust 
to the scale of the problem at hand is essential, as is reducing the 
fragmentation of public policies, with a consequent increase in their 
efficacy, efficiency, and effectiveness. (SDM 6, 2023, p.8 & 9)
This quote exemplifies the tensions of an approach to care: on the one 
hand, it embraces plurality and inclusion as essential for environmental 
policy; on the other, it relates these efforts to the language of efficiency, 
efficacy, and effectiveness, which aligns with a technical and more 
linear approach to complex issues. This tension brings our attention to 
the broader challenges of integrating care into SDMs and BPBES more 
broadly - it highlights the challenge to balance relational, subjective, 
and inclusive aspects of plural care with policy and scientific standards 
and demands for measurable outcomes.
Other studies have also pointed to limitations in the ability of BPBES 
(De Fusco, 2022 ) and SPIs more generally to embrace plurality 
(Díaz-Reviriego, et al., 2019 ). Here, we highlight four challenges of in-
clusive co-production involving diverse knowledge holders and systems. 
First, BPBES does not carry out new research but documents and sum-
marizes existing knowledge, thereby often reproducing epistemic 
exclusion and biases of existing research. Second, most researchers 
working in BPBES are biologists and ecologists who lack methodological 
training for co-production. Third, financial and other resources often 
limit co-production. Fourth, researchers struggle to establish and 
maintain long-term relationships required for substantial co-production 
with communities (De Fusco, 2022 ).
Beyond questions of plurality, care also emerges in the SDMs in 
relation to the well-being of humans and non-humans, including poverty 
reduction and multiple benefits of ecosystem services. 
“Ecosystem-based adaptation, while conserving or restoring/repair -
ing natural resources, sequestering or storing carbon, also has the 
potential to reduce poverty." (SDM 1, 2018, p.18)
"The incorporation of the concept of ecosystem services in the 
implementation of enterprises has great potential to produce solu-
tions that benefit multiple sectors. Various organizations that guide 
project financing have already instructed the adoption of the 
ecosystem services concept in studies that precede their imple -
mentation.” (SDM 3, 2019, p.14)
The complexity of navigating between demands for efficiency, care 
for biodiversity and plurality is not only apparent in the SDMs but is also 
reflected in the interviews. Some interviewees embraced the possibility 
of making these care aspects more explicit in the SDMs: 
“Could it be that if we change our ways and bring affection, care, and 
reciprocity into our documents, we couldn’t we be able to touch 
more hearts and bring about broader changes in behavior?” (I10)
However, other interviewees expressed discomfort with this 
approach, suggesting that such concepts should remain implicit in their 
practice rather than explicitly stated in the reports. For example: 
“I think it would fit, maybe, subliminally, you know? As something 
to keep in mind, right? Maybe, when it comes to thinking about the 
theme of choosing partners, thinking about messages. I don’t think 
it’s possible, as (the document) is more pragmatic, more technical. I 
don’t know to what extent they can absorb this, but I think sublim -
inally it might be interesting to have this in the back of the mind.” 
(I1)
“I don’t think it would take away credibility, but it would make the 
conversation more difficult. Yes, because whether you like it or not, 
you’re inserting degrees of subjectivity and that’s always something 
that’s very complex. But I think it can be worked on. I, for example, A. Ressiore C. et al.

wouldn ’t have that ability. It’s something I’d have to be trained in, 
I’d have to learn how to work ” (I2)
With these mixed perspectives and tensions on the forms of care in 
the BPBES assessments, we shift our focus to the process.
5.2. Care in the SDM-making process
In analyzing care in the process of producing SDMs, we focus on (a) 
motivations, (b) institutional and epistemic structures, and (c) inter-
personal dynamics. Considering (a) motivations in creating SDMs, many 
interviewees emphasized that care is central to the BPBES ’ mission and 
work of synthesizing trustworthy knowledge on biodiversity for a wider 
audience: 
“So I think caring [within BPBES] is to think that there are people 
who are dedicating part of their lives voluntarily for a greater 
benefit, for as many people as possible. Because we take what the 
scientific community is saying, digest it, summarize it, organize it, 
and deliver it. Even though there are those challenges I told you 
about, I think that’s care. ” (I7)
Similar perspectives were shared by all interviewees, who high-
lighted care for biodiversity, care for producing relevant knowledge, 
care for ensuring accessibility, among others. Many interviewees 
expressed personal gratitude for being part of this process, viewing their 
involvement as an investment in synthesizing knowledge that could 
influence change. It also became evident that individual and collective 
communication efforts went beyond the standard structure and pro-
cedures, showing personal and collective care and attentiveness to the 
process. To illustrate that, interviewees highlighted the importance of 
careful communication and empathy when making scientific knowledge 
accessible to a broader audience: 
“We care when we make infographics. We care when we make videos 
explaining, when we make short videos. We care when we hire a 
communications advisor who is a specialist to help disseminate it on 
the radio, on TV, everywhere. ” (I3)
“I understood that the other person always has something important 
to say. So we need to listen to others in order to incorporate and 
exchange what is relevant in this process. […] This process of dia-
logue based on what science produces is an effort of empathy — 
putting oneself in the other person ’s shoes. ” (I6)
The (b) institutional and epistemic structures discipline the SDMs 
into standardized procedures (following IPBES formats) while deem -
phasizing subjectivity, but care remains expressed through the produc -
tion, synthesis, and communication of knowledge: 
“We try to use easy language, try to be assertive, but you can’t be 
prescriptive, so there ’s a whole pattern we follow ” (I6)
These patterns are based on scientific platform rules that policy- 
relevant knowledge should be neutral, ‘policy-relevant, yet not policy- 
prescriptive ’ (IPCC, n.d.; see also Watson, 2005 ; Beck, 2011 ; Turnhout 
et al., 2016 ). While this has been extensively criticized as depoliticizing 
(Turnhout et al., 2013, 2016; Turnhout, 2024; Beck, 2011, Beck et al., 
2014; Karhunmaa, 2020; Rasanen et al., 2024 ), one interviewee argued 
that such approach is fundamental for policy-relevant knowledge: 
“It is a transparent process, and it must truly be independent . The 
chapter coordinators lead the writing and manage the authors and 
collaborators. […] It’s approached with a strong sense of neutrality , 
right? We cannot have any political bias, so it’s based on science — 
what key information we want to convey, whether it hurts or not, but 
that’s it. […] It was a transparent, independent, and neutral process .” (I9)
Although this interviewee appeals to a “strong sense of neutrality, ” 
this sentiment is not shared among all interviews and documents 
analyzed. Indeed, the interviewees consistently highlight that policy- relevant knowledge is different from academic knowledge in the 
format and communication strategies: 
"I understand that it is a type of knowledge that, first of all, is very 
synthesizing , right? It brings up the main points. It brings up the main 
information, right? It has to use colloquial language while still being 
precise. I believe it also needs to be visually appealing and graphi -
cally attractive." (I8)
“I think that when it comes to building the summary, how you 
communicate your results is much more relevant because the data 
itself will be a tool. It won ’t be the central thing - I think commu -
nication is the central thing in the summary. ” (I5)
"Yes, it is (different). It’s a more translated and simplified language 
[…]. The full scientific report with data is more robust and has a very 
scientific language that, in a way, only serves the academic com-
munity." (I9)
Although the SMDs look different from academic papers and aim to 
be more accessible, the authors also highlight that policy-relevant 
knowledge is always based on scientific knowledge and evidence. The 
following quotes highlight the usability and the trustworthiness some 
interviewees believe must be considered for policy-relevant knowledge: 
“In ecology, there ’s always uncertainty […] We bring a certain 
amount of information because these are complex systems with very 
particular dynamics, which is very difficult for the decision maker. 
They want to know, ’What do I do?’, ’Do I release or not release this 
species? ’ ’Do I plant or not plant? ’ ’Am I going to get this result in the 
end or not? ’ […] The effort is about how to operationalize this in-
formation so that it arrives in a format where the decision maker can 
make a choice, understanding the risks, opportunities, and possibil -
ities from there. ” (I4)
“Scientists have difficulty in making complex and deep things usable . 
So I think we take great care in the production of the scenario, in the 
process, in providing information, in writing in a way that is un-
derstandable and trustworthy. ” (I6)
A care perspective invites reflexivity about what is considered rele-
vant for decision makers. Knowledge is deeply tied to who creates it 
(Harding, 1993 ), and appeals to relevance are mediated by “how sys-
tems of domination shape or limit research questions, methodological 
decisions, conceptual frameworks, models, assumptions and in-
terpretations of data ” (Staffa et al., 2022 , p. 49). Aware of such chal-
lenges, I10 discusses the difficulties of meeting the needs for what are 
considered absolute truths that could make decisions easier and more 
predictable: 
"Whether we like it or not, science positions itself as an unques -
tionable truth, which we know it is not. […] And decision makers, 
especially legislators and executives, want truths . They want you to 
tell them what the deforestation rate is, and how many species there 
are […] they want absolute truths. What I think we can contribute is 
showing that this knowledge is also being constructed, decon -
structed, and co-constructed throughout history, right?" (I10)
Four out of the ten interviewees explicitly expressed critical re-
flections about relevance and authority. However, our content analysis 
and interviews also indicate that they remain in tension with the prev-
alence of scientific approaches that tie trustworthiness to neutrality and 
the elimination of any subjective elements.
The (c) interpersonal dynamics add further complexity to the 
knowledge-making and summarizing process. The interviewees noted 
the challenges of working with diverse stakeholders, diverse disciplines, 
and difficulties in managing interpersonal dynamics within the Platform 
work: 
“You can imagine when you get a group of researchers together — all 
senior researchers, all experts in their fields — there ’s an instant A. Ressiore C. et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Environmental  Science  and Policy  171 (2025)  104170

clash of egos, which is also quite big and sometimes difficult to 
manage. We didn’t have any serious problems, but you’re often 
walking on eggshells. That was the hardest thing for me — to 
maintain a group where people brought their opinions, and those 
opinions were considered and evaluated.” (I3)
“I found it quite challenging, this issue of having many authors, you 
know? People needed to understand what their role was because a lot 
of people think their role is to be a text editor, right? […] ‘I need you 
to send me a paragraph or half a paragraph. You’re the specialist, so 
write the paragraph on this’.” (I6)
The care literature emphasizes that tensions and conflicts are an 
integral part of care (Bartos, 2018; Cox, 2010 ). Puig de la Bellacasa 
further highlights that it is essential to ensure “accountable knowledge 
construction that does not negate dissent” (2017, p.79). Maintaining 
good interpersonal dynamics is a crucial part of the care embedded in 
BPBES, which, in our analysis, reflects both the rewarding and chal-
lenging aspects of collaborative work. While there seem to be different 
positions, perspectives, and opinions, interviewees often expressed the 
experience as meaningful, learning-full, and gratifying, based on what 
they described as a caring environment created between authors.
5.3. Care for policy impact
BPBES’s mission to “produce syntheses of the best available knowl -
edge,” (BPBES, n.d.) for biodiversity conservation reflects its care for 
sustaining diversity of life in Brazil. While the impact on conservation is 
an essential component of the mission of BPBES, interviewees noted the 
challenges in tracking the influence of their work: 
“We map very poorly the impacts of the platform […] We don’t have 
mechanisms for this.” (I1)
"I never had time to map that out." (I9) - Referring to the impact of 
the actions taken based on the summaries.
Many interviewees recognize a need to spend more time and effort to 
increase and map impact after the report is published, including 
advertising and having workshops. In 2022, data retrieved from the 
platform showed that the majority of document downloads came from: 
70 % universities, research institutes, and students; 9 % government 
sector; 7 % civil society; 6 % private sector; 1 % multilateral organiza -
tions; 1 % press/media; 6 % others (De Fusco, 2022 , source: BPBES). 
This contributes to the understanding that the impact on decision- and 
policymakers has been more limited than planned.
Some interviewees provided concrete examples of how the reports 
have been used in policy discussions but also highlighted the challenges 
regarding policy influence. They talked about evidence that the Brazil -
ian National Ministry of Environment has been using the reports and has 
been inviting some of the authors more frequently for meetings and 
consultations. One example is related to SDM 2 that resulted in an 
actionable policy minutes: 
“We drew up a draft of a national pollination policy together with the 
Ministry of Agriculture, but later, with the new changes [in the Na-
tional Government politics - referring to Bolsonaro’s Mandate], it 
stopped. So, I really don’t know how much progress has been made.” 
(I4)
The quote reveals the challenges in ensuring that the care put into 
making the reports has long-term results, policy commitments, and real- 
world impact. External factors such as national politics and institutional 
limitations often interfere with the reach and effectiveness of the 
reports: 
“We were unlucky in that. We were finishing our reports and 
launching when there was a change of government, so let’s say that 
the environment wasn’t very high on the previous government’s 
agenda [referring to the Bolsonaro government mandate].” (I3)These issues connect not only to structural and systemic politics but 
also to (inter)personal dynamics, as shown in the response below: 
“I think that one of the platforms’ challenges is the fact that it’s not 
an institution, let’s say, it doesn’t have a CNPJ [National Register of 
Legal Entities], it doesn’t have a Secretariat, it doesn’t have that. This 
makes logistics very difficult for us to ensure that this operational 
effort that the platform requires can be made possible, for example, 
with more autonomy […] if someone wants to invest in the platform, 
we can’t receive that money. There’s no legal mechanism to make it 
possible.” (I4)
“The best people, the best data, the best design, I think everything is 
being done, but we still can’t do the other step, which is to get this 
material to everyone. […] Maybe we haven’t launched it in the best 
way, have we? Maybe we haven’t publicized it in the best way, and 
that’s not because “Oh, people aren’t interested?” No, it’s because 
the platform has no resources, and the people working on the plat-
form were volunteers. In addition to supervising X number of stu-
dents, giving X number of hours, and being involved in the 
construction of public policies, we also have to coordinate a platform 
and make sure that the information reaches everyone. There’s no 
way [we can do all of that].” (I6)
These reflections show that, despite the interviewees’ and platform’s 
best efforts, external political and financial constraints, as well as (inter) 
personal dynamics and procedural issues, significantly limit the ability 
of care to go beyond permeating the work put into the SDMs and the 
interpersonal relations. As a result, BPBES struggles to systematically 
impact and transform decision-making by means of policy-relevant 
knowledge, which limits, in turn, its impacts on biodiversity 
conservation.
6.Discussion: care and the legacy of the linear model
In environmental policy, linear understandings of science-policy re-
lations shape organizations like BPBES, incentivizing them to frame 
policy-relevant knowledge as apolitical, neutral, and objective (Beck, 
2011; Beck et al., 2014; Compagnon and Cramer, 2016; Mahony and 
Hulme, 2018; Gustafsson and Lidskog, 2023 ). As such framings sideline 
knowledge plurality and obscure political agendas deeply ingrained in 
environmental policy (Turnhout, 2024 ), this article has analyzed 
policy-relevant knowledge production in BPBES through the lens of care 
rather than as a neutral summarization of facts.
Regarding the content of the assessments, SDMs do not directly 
mention terms like “care,” “reciprocity” and “empathy”. Some in-
terviewees suggested that introducing more explicit care terminology 
could ‘touch hearts’, meaning that it could gain the attention of new 
audiences and even shift practices. Others were concerned about overtly 
subjective language tainting the credibility or objectivity of the report as 
a factual synthesis of evidence and knowledge. The question of whether 
care-related terminology fits into the SDMs directly relates back to the 
tension of neutrality being simultaneously seen as limiting and as an 
essential component of conveying epistemic authority along the linear 
model of science-policy relations.
This is not to say that care-related terminology is entirely absent in 
the SDMs. Care is expressed through the use of terms like “repair”, 
“maintenance”, and “restoration”. These terms reflect the commitment 
of BPBES members to sustaining socio-ecological systems and show 
some openness to making care for biodiversity an explicit part of SDMs. 
At the same time, this language remains tied to technical demands of 
efficiency in environmental policy, restricting care largely to contexts 
where it can be translated into standardized and scalable practices with 
quantifiable impact. Care, in its more substantive complexity, as out-
lined in our theory section, currently has a very limited place in the 
structures that shape the content of SDMs.
Similar tensions emerge regarding the process of producing BPBES A. Ressiore C. et al.

assessments. We noted that experts care deeply about ensuring that the 
assessments are relevant, accessible, and understandable for decision- 
makers. Our findings also show that these aspirations often reinforce a 
linear model in which appeals to the neutrality and objectivity of sci-
entists become the core strategy for communicating authority to deci-
sion makers. As such, the process often puts aside overtly affective or 
political aspects of care while catering to what I10 described as decision 
makers ’ demand for “absolute truths. ” Yet, these appeals to “absolute 
truths ” point to unresolved tensions with BPBES ’s ambition of inclu -
siveness towards plural forms of knowledge and perspectives. For 
example, it has been widely argued that the extraction of Indigenous 
knowledge for academic purposes often does more harm than good 
(Alcoff, 2022; Ludwig and Poliseli, 2018; Kimmerer, 2012 ). If Indige -
nous knowledge is reduced to supplementary data for mainstream sci-
ence and governance, it becomes detached from Indigenous and local 
practices and livelihoods. Recognizing that plural forms of knowledge 
are always entangled with socially situated standpoints (Harding, 1993; 
Haraway, 1988 ), however, threatens the linear narrative of 
policy-relevant knowledge being independent from politicized issues 
such as Indigenous struggles for self-determination.
Furthermore, inclusive collaborations do not merely require theo-
retical challenges of the linear model but also interpersonal care in 
fostering transdisciplinary knowledge production, including conflict 
resolution, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring inclusivity (Sellberg 
et al., 2021; Milberg Mu~niz et al., 2024; De La Rosa et al., 2024 ). 
Feminist thinkers have argued that more caring forms of research 
require a commitment to participatory and collective work (Mountz 
et al., 2015; Staffa et al., 2022 ). They involve slowing down (Stengers, 
2016 ). The imperative of efficiency, however, makes it difficult to 
develop such caring practices, threatening to stifle the capabilities to 
care for ourselves and others (Mountz et al., 2015; Manzi et al., 2024 ). 
This issue becomes particularly pressing regarding BPBES ’s and other 
SPI platforms ’ ability to engage meaningfully with Indigenous and local 
ontologies (Díaz-Reviriego et al., 2019 ). As SDMs are presented as 
objective scientific summaries, knowledge based on non-modern on-
tologies often appears incommensurable with dominant framings. 
Indigenous ontologies, including practices of care, may, therefore, 
appear too subjective to fit into SDMs. As Staffa et al. (2022) note, 
modern science often creates a binary that sidelines emotions, associ -
ating them with the private sphere and deeming them inappropriate for 
the objective sphere of research. This exclusion and separation become 
particularly striking regarding what is considered subjective, as well as 
Indigenous and local practices of care, limiting BPBES ’s ability to realize 
its ambitions of plurality and inclusivity.
Finally, we turn to impact , which is where a considerable part of 
BPBES ’s mission is intended to be realized. As much as interviewees 
personally and professionally care about impact, the assessments ’ actual 
impact routes are often undermined by bureaucracies, political contes -
tation, academic overburden, economic priorities, resource limitations, 
and epistemic challenges. Furthermore, having an impact through 
“policy relevance ” often means focusing on utility rather than care 
(Prattes, 2023 ) and showcasing efficiency rather than subjectivity or 
reciprocity toward biodiversity. Even if concern about impact was 
evident across the interviews, the modern and linear model, as well as 
the wider interpersonal and systemic/institutional challenges into 
which BPBES is currently inserted, does not provide many openings for 
care and impact in substantive ways.
In sum, care is present but also strikingly precarious across all three 
dimensions - content, process, and impact - investigated in this study. Of 
course, BPBES members care about biodiversity. It drives their 
involvement in the platform, is reflected in the content of the assess -
ment, and is articulated in the desire to have an impact on policy and 
decision-making. At the same time, the forms of care often remain su-
perficial and are severely restricted by the neoliberal, economic, sys-
tematic, institutional, and epistemic set-up of BPBES, striving to provide 
neutral and objective knowledge in efficient and usable ways. These restrictions risk reproducing a simplistic linear model of science-policy 
relations while also threatening the ambitions of BPBES to include 
diverse actors, with plural forms of knowledge and care, in the assess -
ment production.
7.Conclusion: caring policy-relevant knowledge?
The title of this article remains a question as the results indicate 
substantial challenges to producing and practicing caring policy- 
relevant knowledge in the content, process, and impact of the SDMs. 
At the same time, our findings are not exclusively negative. Care is 
present across each of the investigated aspects of BPBES, highlighting 
the possibility that “another knowledge is possible ” (Escobar et al., 
2020; Turnhout, 2024 ) that embraces its affective, subjective, messy, 
political dimensions and allows for a more caring policy-relevant 
knowledge. Rather than presenting a sterile dichotomy between 
policy-relevant objective facts and policy-irrelevant subjective care, 
such a vision of caring policy-relevant knowledge could guide BPBES 
and other SPI platforms toward a more nuanced understanding of the 
complexity of knowledge production while opening research and 
governance toward diversity and plurality in knowledge and care.
Articulating such vision and practice of caring policy-relevant 
knowledge, however, requires more than just mentioning care in the 
discourse and content of SDMs. Discourse without practice risks repro -
ducing buzzwords — empty language used to attract attention but 
disconnected from real-world practices (Cornwall, 2010; Ludwig et al., 
2024 ). Care is a powerful concept, but its transformative potential lies in 
its intrinsic relationship with practice. As care terminology gains 
prominence in academic and political spaces, especially post-COVID-19 
(Holemans et al., 2021; Lula, 2023; The Care Collective, 2020 ), a sub-
stantive articulation of caring policy-relevant knowledge would have to 
provide more than just fashionable care terminology and appeals to care 
theory. Much like other trending concepts, care can be diluted, co-opted, 
or even weaponized in ways that replicate colonial harms (Prattes, 
2023 ).
One strategy for moving from care discourse to care practice is to 
build stronger transdisciplinary commitments. Transdisciplinarity, 
however, requires continuous training to develop transdisciplinary skills 
and sensitivities (Deutsch et al., 2023 ), resource availability, and 
collaborative processes that value inclusivity even when it comes to 
tension with dominant understandings of relevance and efficiency. 
Plural actors like policymakers, scientists, and local communities bring 
diverse priorities, expectations, epistemologies, ontologies, and values 
that do not always form a harmonious whole. Negotiations and di-
alogues are, therefore, necessary (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017 ). Conse -
quently, caring policy-relevant knowledge may require stepping away 
from comfortable narratives of transdisciplinarity that are based on 
frictionless notions of knowledge integration (Klenk and Meehan, 2015 ) 
or on ideals of win-win solutions. Care in transdisciplinary processes 
demands reflexivity in questioning comfortable assumptions, willing -
ness to work through conflicts and tensions, and commitment to build -
ing new relations (Gottschlich and Katz, 2019; Staffa et al., 2022 ). This 
approach not only benefits policy-relevant knowledge creators but also 
could offer decision-makers an opportunity to shift perspectives and 
practices.
Navigating between policy demands for factual research assessments 
on one hand and the relational character of care on the other it remains a 
core challenge. While we recognize that policy-relevant knowledge must 
remain accessible and credible, creating a space for care will also require 
addressing the deeply entrenched legacy of the linear model in science- 
policy interface platforms like BPBES. Specifically, we suggest that 
policy-relevant knowledge cannot afford to strip away the situated, 
relational, and embodied aspects of care in the process. After all, the 
transformative role of care lies in its ability to weave together discourse, 
practice, and relationality to create knowledge that is not only relevant 
but also affective and ethical.A.

(a) Do you think this knowledge is different from scientific knowledge?
9 Vocke poderia me contar um pouco sobre o desenvolvimento dos sum˘arios para os 
tomadores de decis ~ao. E como foi/˘e a sua participaç ~ao? E mais especificamente, como 
˘e o processo de decidir o que entra e o que n~ao entra nesse sum˘ario?Could you tell me a little about the development of the summaries for decision- 
makers? And what was/is your role in this process? More specifically, how is the 
process of deciding what is included and what is left out of these summaries?
10 No seu trabalho, escrevendo os sum˘arios para os tomadores de decis ~ao, vocke percebe 
alguma tens~ao/conflito entre o processo de criar o conhecimento e o processo da 
pr˘atica (no caso implementar as políticas)?In your work writing summaries for decision-makers, do you notice any tension 
between the process of creating knowledge and the process of practice (in this case, 
implementing policies)?
​ Care & More-than-human care
11 Em poucas palavras, quando falo cuidar ou cuidado, o que ˘e que lhe vem primeiro ˇa 
mente? (um sinkonimo, talvez)In a few words, when I say care or caring, what comes to your mind first? (perhaps a 
synonym)
12 O que ˘e uma relaç ~ao cuidadosa para vocke? What is a caring relations in your view?
13 O que vocke diria que ˘e uma forma de cuidar da biodiversidade? 
(a) Vocke consegue pensar em algum exemplo de relaç ~oes (entre humanos e 
biodiversidade) que vocke acha cuidadosa?What would you say is a way to care for biodiversity? 
(a) Can you think of any examples of relationships (between humans and 
biodiversity) that you consider caring?
14 Quando pensa em cuidar ou cuidado no kambito da BPBES, o que ˘e que lhe vem ˇa 
mente?When you think of care or caring within the BPBES, what comes to mind?
15 O que ˘e que voce diria que ˘e uma forma explicita de cuidado nos sum˘arios para os 
tomadores de decisao?What would you say is an explicit form of care in the summaries for decision-makers?
16 O que ˘e que vocke diria que ˘e uma forma implícita de cuidado nos sum˘arios para os 
tomadores de decisao?What would you say is an implicit form of care in the summaries for decision-makers?
Care & Policy-relevant Knowledge
17 Vocke acha que o tipo de conhecimento que vocke produziu/sumarizou para os relat ˘orios 
influenciou a sua forma de cuidar (nesse caso, mais especificamente dos seres da 
natureza)? 
(a) E a sua forma de cuidar (tamb ˘em em relaç ~ao ˇa natureza) influencia o 
conhecimento produzido?Do you think the type of knowledge you produced/summarized for the reports has 
influenced your way of caring (in this case, more specifically for beings in nature)? 
(a) And does your way of caring (also in relation to nature) influence the knowledge 
produced?
18 Existe alguma forma em que o tipo de conhecimento relevante para as políticas 
poderia ser mais cuidadoso? 
(a) Como? Se n~ao, por quke? Quais s~ao os impedimentos?Is there any way in which the type of knowledge relevant to policies could be more 
caring? 
(a) How? If not, why? What are the barriers?
More informal reflections at the end when with time
19 Na minha pesquisa, aprendi que o cuidado entre humans e natureza tem a ver com 
pr˘aticas quotidianas do dia a dia; que ele baseia-se em relaç ~oes de interconex ~ao e 
interdepend kencia entre humanos e n~ao-humanos e na reciprocidade entre esp˘ecies. 
Tem tamb ˘em um aspecto autorreflexivo. Tem como objetivo de que muitos (humanos 
e n~ao humanos) possam florescer juntos. Finalmente tem tamb ˘em o potencial de In my research, I learned that care between humans and nature has to do with 
everyday practices; that it is based on relationships of interconnectedness and 
interdependence between humans and non-humans, as well as reciprocity between 
species. It also has a self-reflective aspect. Its goal is for many (humans and non-

sobre isso?humans) to flourish together. Finally, it also has the potential to broaden perspectives 
on human and non-human care relationships. What do you think about this?
20 Trabalhando com as quebradeiras de coco babaçu (MIQCB), aprendi que o conflito 
muitas vezes acaba coexistindo com o cuidado, permitindo que elas possam cuidar da e 
com as palmeiras de babaçu. Vocke vke essa coexist kencia de cuidado e conflito como algo 
tamb ˘em presente no trabalho da BPBES?Working with the babaçu coconut breakers (MIQCB), I learned that conflict often 
coexists with care, enabling them to care for and with the babaçu palm trees. Do you 
see this coexistence of care and conflict as something also present in what BPBES 
does?

reflex ~ao baseada na nossa conversa?Would you like to ask me something? Any suggestion or reflexion from this 
conversation?
